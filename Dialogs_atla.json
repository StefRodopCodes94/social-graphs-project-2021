here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast.","Goodnight.","''Goodnight!''","Slow down, Katara.","When did this happen?","Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone.","I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work.","There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines.","All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here.","The boulder

better hide.","We don't have much time.","What are we gonna do?","Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?","For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock.","Something they can bend.","It should.","These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village.","We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale.","There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo.","And the whole system is ventilated.","Aang closed off all the vents except one.","When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go, right back here.","Stay back!","I'm warning you!","It's like a scar ...","Listen.","It's so quiet.","There's no life anywhere.","What?","I'm not allowed to be angry?","Cheered me up.","Ow.","Yeah, I probably deserved that.","Hey, who are you?","Why is it attacking you?","Yeah.","We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster.","This isn't right.","We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.","He still shouldn't have to face this alone.","It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying.","Maybe we should go help him.","That's it.","He needs help.","Hei Bai, over here!","We'll fight him together, Aang.","Aang!","Over here!","Help!","What happened?","Like I seriously need to use the bathroom.","You could give us some supplies, and some money.","What?","We need stuff.","What is it?","Creepy, but great.","At least, not without your friends.","We got your back.","Ew!","Yeah!","And it's gaining, fast!","Can't you make Appa go any faster?","Let's run this blockade!","We got into the Fire Nation.","Great.","No!","I'm good.","Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders!","Well ...","I was talking to Momo.","I don't see any guards.","Wait.","I think I heard something.","Do you know where you're going?","Firebenders aren't our friends!","Hey don't feel bad.","You're only a hundred years late!","Five fire blasts, huh?","I think I can help you out.","This is a little trick I picked up from my father.","I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, ta-da!","Fake firebending!","I don't get it.","That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.","Come on Aang.","Let her dream.","How are ''we'' gonna make it out of this?","We got your back.","Would you sit down?","If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off.","What's bugging you anyway?","Well, let's see.","You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years.","I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.","Nice puddle.","Great.","So what am I supposed to do?","So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet?","Okay.","Yeah, don't get too happy.","You've got to do ''me'' next.","Aang?!","Yeah, I'll say!","You just \"practiced\" our supplies down the river.","My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender.","We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us.","Let's spend it wisely.","It doesn't even work.","See?","Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.","Wait a minute ... Sea loving traders, with suspiciously acquired merchandise, and pet reptile birds?","You guys are pirates!","Yeah, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.","Whoa!","No wonder they were trying to hack us up!","You stole their waterbending scroll!","It doesn't matter.","You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes.","Whatever.","Ha, ha, ha!","What about Momo?","He's the real victim here.","Huh?","Where did she go?","I don't believe it.","She took the scroll!","She's obsessed with that thing.","It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep- Oh, what?","I'm not good enough to kidnap?","Ah!","You're really gonna hand over ''the Avatar'' for a stupid piece of parchment?","Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll.","I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense.","Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar.","You guys would be set for life.","Aang, are you there?","Where?","I can't find you!","We'd need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.","I don't know how.","This thing wasn't made by the Water Tribe!","Would you two quit congratulating each other and help me out?","Have you lost your mind?","This is no time for flute practice!","But we have another problem.","Yeah, we owe you one.","Is that really how you feel?","First, what did you learn?","Right, got it ... Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not.","Besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.","What if it doesn't?","Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing.","Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry.","Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job- Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs.","Whatever.","Okay, I've seen enough.","Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.","Calm down, we know you're next.","Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business.","Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?","His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isn't it?","We gotta help him!","Okay, now we gotta help ''me''!","I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers.","So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?","Exactly!","Finally, someone gets it!","Would I!","Hm-hmm.","Hmm.","That's just terrible.","You gonna finish that?","Yeah Katara, what are you talking about?","Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.","We barely survived one!","Me too.","I only took their side 'cause they fed me.","That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.","What?","What's going on?","Did we get captured again?","Don't have to tell me twice.","Guys, wait.","This was in my dream.","We shouldn't go to the market.","Out of food and out of money.","Now what are we supposed to do?","Are you kidding?","Shelter from ''what''?","I'll go.","What?","You said get a job ... and he's ''paying double''.","I said I was going to do this job.","I can't back out just because of some bad weather.","Hey!","They left without saying good-bye!","I know!","This one time, I was ...","I'm too young to die!","Seriously, you're still going to pay me, right?","Do you hear that?","It stopped raining.","You know what I love about Appa the most?","His sense of humor.","Classic Appa.","Take that, you rock!","Ha, ha!","You guys are killing me!","Katara, please, water.","Water ... Who's this \"Aang\" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?","Mmmm!","This is tasty!","Mmm!","He is taunting us!","You are so going to be dinner!","Hey, where's the fishing line?","Aw, it's all tangled!","Great, Aang.","Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business.","Stop taunting me!","Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love!","No, play dead!","He'll lose interest!","No, punch him in the bill!","Mmm, lunch!","Lucky for you, we came along.","Oh, come on.","Fortune telling is nonsense!","No, it doesn't!","You can't ''really'' tell the future!","Of course she predicted it was going to rain.","The sky's been gray all day!","Look, I'm going to predict the future now.","It's going to keep drizzling.","See?","Agh!","I'll try a curd puff.","Don't be modest!","They're huge!","I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.","It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.","Boring stuff I'm sure.","Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have.","Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.","I don't even want to know!","Okay, let's get this over with.","But you didn't read my palms or anything!","Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax.","That woman is crazy!","My life will calm and happy and joyful!","That doesn't prove ''anything''!","Do you even hear yourself?","I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition!","I can't believe all these saps!","Someone really needs to scream some sense into them.","Not for long.","I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.","Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?","Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?","I don't care what Aunt Wu told you!","You have to take a bath sometime!","''Some'' stuff?","You've come to the right place.","What can I do you for?","I think I know who you mean.","Of course I am.","And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.","Oh yeah, she's crazy about you.","All you have to do now is not mess it up.","The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.","Yep.","If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.","Wow, that kid is good.","I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower.","Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.","What?","Don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too.","Those people all think they're safe!","We've got to warn them!","Well, we have other things to worry about.","Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.","Everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second!","Aunt Wu was wrong!","Look!","Can your fortune telling explain that?","I know that's the problem.","Aunt Wu, look!","Something is happening in the clouds.","Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot.","If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.","Everybody else grab a shovel Come on!","We've gotta hurry!","Dig faster!","Dig faster!","Man, sometimes I forget what a powerful bender that kid is.","Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.","No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling.","I hate you.","Let me see that.","This is a Water Tribe weapon.","See if you can find anything else.","It's burned.","There was a battle!","Water Tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.","The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill.","I don't know.","The trail ends here.","It's one of our boats!","No, but it's from his fleet.","Dad was here.","I'm coming with you.","I'm strong, I'm brave, I can fight!","Please, Dad!","I don't understand.","Who's there?","Bato?","Where's Dad?","What smells so good, Bato?","Perfume?","Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much.","Am I right?","Everything's here, even the pelts!","Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things!","So, who was it that came up with the Great Blubber Fiasco?","It's a long one Aang, some other time.","Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?","When?","It's been over two years since we've seen Dad.","That would be so incredible!","Katara!","It would be great, but we can't.","We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.","Is this the boat he took you ice dodging in?","How are we supposed to ice dodge without ice?","Aang, ease up on the jib.","Katara, steady.","Aang, less sail.","Katara, give him room.","Aang, helm to lee.","Helm to lee!","Great job!","We can make it.","Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail.","Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks.","Now!","This is the map to our father!","You had it the whole time?","How could you?","Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own.","I'm going to find Dad.","Katara, are you with me?","It's probably wounded.","We need to go back.","I wanna see Dad, but, helping Aang is where we're needed the most.","Thanks, Bato.","We split up.","He's long gone.","Pretty stupid.","Run!","I'm ... starting to get some feeling back!","Ow.","That thing sees with its nose.","Let's give him something to look at.","Yeah, we've lost too much time as it is.","Of course we do, Aang.","But, you're our family, too.","And right now, you need us more.","I wonder why they left this boat?","There's nothing wrong with it.","I don't want to talk about it.","See if you can find a menu, I'm starving!","A wanted poster!","This is bad.","It's like you're a whole different person ... Where are we gonna get masks like that?","That was surprisingly easy.","Finally!","What do you have?","I'll take'em!","Aaahhh!","Hot!","Hot!","Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.","What do you think you're doing?","No, we don't want to make a scene!","I think it's time to go.","I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!","You really know your explosives ... You're a Fire Nation Soldier!","He was very highly ranked, we get it.","We're ''not'' gonna go find some ''crazy'' firebender!","Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the North Pole in the morning.","That's what you said about going to the festival!","Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?","Hold on, you know these guys?","Finally!","Let's hit the road.","''Hey''!","Katara, what's wrong?","What did you do?!","I told you we shouldn't mess around with this!","Look what you did!","''You burned my sister''!","You burned my sister!","This is all your fault!","Katara!","Are you all right?","Aang, come on!","Let's go!","He disappeared.","They all did.","When did you learn that?","Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years.","Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble.","Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!","Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me!","Thanks for healing that up.","That was great.","Really helpful.","Sorry ... You want me to be like you, or totally honest?","I'm saying you're an optimist.","Same thing, basically.","What do you mean \"they're not\"?","Those guys are flying!","We better find some solid ground, before it finds us.","Wow!","This glider chair is incredible!","Wow!","So better!","Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing?","The notches all look the same.","You put spark powder in the candle!","Aaah!","These lanterns are terrible.","I can't see!","Why would you want to use fireflies for light?","Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.","So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen.","Ugh!","Week old egg smell!","How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!?","Yeah ... if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ... Then, if there's a leak ... And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!","You make weapons for the Fire Nation?!","Very bad!","Thank you.","You're a genius!","See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, but once it did, it just kept going.","You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape.","So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?","A lid is actually the answer.","If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.","Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs: smoke, slime, fire, and ... Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?","Then I guess they won't see this coming.","Oh no, that was the last one.","Rotten eggs!","There!","That's were the gas is escaping.","It's the only bomb we've got.","We're going down!","Get ready!","Aang you were right about air power.","As long as we've got the skies, we'll have the Fire Nation on the run.","We're finally here.","Yeah ... she is ... Hi there.","Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.","So ... uhhh ... you're a princess, huh?","You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself.","A lot of things!","Do you mind?","I'm trying to have a conversation here.","So, it looks like I'm going to be in town for a while.","I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together?","Princess Yue, good morning!","How about that picnic last night?","Boy, your dad sure does know how to throw a party.","Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.","So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.","Yes ... at a place ... for some time.","That's okay, it was worth it.","See you tonight.","Hi, Princess Yue.","I made you something.","I carved it myself.","Actually, it's supposed to be a fish.","See, it has a fin.","No, it's Princess Yue.","I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost.","So, how's waterbending training?","Why don't you just teach her, Aang?","I'm not happy.","Yeah, I think she did.","Are you crazy, Katara?","You're not going to win this fight!","Nothing.","I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.","No, no.","See, that's the thing.","I think I do understand now.","You're a Princess, and I'm ...","I'm just a Southern peasant.","It's okay.","You don't have to say anything.","I'll see you around, okay?","Okay, now I'm really confused.","''Happy'', but confused.","Are you kidding?","I grew up in a block of ice.","It's not exactly a cultural hub.","What's wrong?","We're taking a walk!","I know what you need.","You need to meet my good friend, Appa.","Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy?","Ah, ah, easy!","Down boy!","Agh!","No, up!","Yeah, we pretty much live up here.","Not when you're with someone.","Yeah ...","Woo, yeah!","Ahhh, good times, good times.","Hey, look!","Oh no ... Soot.","I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked.","It's soot mixed with snow.","It's the Fire Nation.","They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff, I'd say there's a lot of them.","What's wrong?","We have to go!","What?","We're just friends.","You don't love him, do you?","You don't even seem to like him.","You're not marrying ''them.''","Count me in!","Katara!","Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.","When, like, a hundred years ago?","The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore.","The newer uniforms are more streamlined.","His name is Zhao.","Middle-aged, big sideburns, bigger temper ...","Nothing.","Congratulations.","Perks?","What does ''that'' mean?","Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!","It's Admiral ''Zhao''!","Oh, no.","Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang.","Everything's fine.","What, you want me to scrub the barracks?","Oh ... Sure.","That ... shouldn't be too hard.","What happened?","Where's Zuko?","Where did they go ... You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back.","Zuko can't have gotten far.","We'll find him.","Aang's gonna be fine.","Yip, yip.","They're not going to die in this blizzard.","If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up.","They'll survive, and we'll find them.","Hey, this is some quality rope!","Sure we can.","Let's go.","Yeah, this makes a lot of sense.","Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.","Are you okay?","What do you mean?","No!","You don't have to do that.","I won't let you!","Your father told me to protect you.","No!","She's gone, she's gone.","You must be proud.","There it is!","Not bad, not bad.","But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar State.","Why not?","Remember when he took out the Fire Navy?","He was incredible!","Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord!","I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death.","Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar State.","Huh?","You sure?","Okay.","What can he say?","You're the Avatar.","Who knows better than you?","Aang!","The general's gone crazy!","He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar State!","Good ... bird ... horse thingy ... Katara!","No!","Anybody got a problem with that?","You guys are going to be done soon, right?","We have a lot of ground to cover if we're going to make it to Omashu today.","I could be ready in two minutes.","Seriously, whenever.","Who are you?","Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me.","We need to get to Omashu.","No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows.","O. Ma.","Shu!","I think we'll just stick with flying.","We've dealt with the Fire Nation before.","We'll be fine.","Secret love cave, let's go.","How far are we from the tunnel?","Curse!","What exactly is this curse?","That's it!","There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!","It's Fire Nation.","They're tracking us.","We will be fine.","All we need is a plan.","Chong, how long do those torches last?","It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!","I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been.","Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.","This doesn't make sense.","We already came through this way.","There's something strange here.","There's only one explanation.","The tunnels are changing.","Right, if only we listened to you.","Nooooo!","At least I'm ''thinking'' of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku.","No, they were trying to get away from something!","Badgermoles coming toward me.","Come on guys, help me out!","How did you guys get out?","Really?","We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way.","Just play your songs.","The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about: the destination.","I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O- Oh no ... Up until now it was.","Now Ba Sing Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.","Aang, stop.","We don't even know if Bumi's still ... A-around.","A secret passage?","Why didn't we just use this last time?","Ugh!","Eww!","Ahh!","They won't let go!","Help!","Oh, it's so awful.","I'm dying.","Where would they be keeping him?","Suckers!","You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.","The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta act sick too.","Ya gotta sell it!","Now that's what I'm talkin' about.","Okay everyone!","Into sick formation.","No!","Bad Fire Nation baby!","Oh ... all right.","You realize we're probably walking right into a trap.","Way ahead of ya!","I seem to manage!","We can catch him!","Hey, you taking us down for a reason?","Aang, why are we going down?","Are you noticing now?","Is it telling you where we can get something to eat?","No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.","Yes.","See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here.","You better throw in an extra \"yip\"!","We gotta move!","Where?","Where?","Why do things keep attaching to me?!","We better speed things up.","Aang, these are just plants.","Do you want me to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" as I swing my machete back and forth?","I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can.","There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them.","We'll have to make camp for the night.","Nothing, just swamp gas.","Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.","I think we should build a fire.","No, I asked the swamp.","It said this was fine.","Right, swamp?","\"No problem, Sokka!\"","Please, we're all alone out here.","Right, except for them.","Aang!","Stupid swamp!","Dumb, ugly vines!","Katara!","You think you're so tough, huh?","Hello?","Yue?","This is just a trick of the light ... swamp gas ...","I ... hit my head running away last night.","I'm going crazy.","What do you guys think you're doing!?","I've been looking all over for you!","Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!","Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us.","That's why we all saw things out here.","I thought I saw Yue.","But, that doesn't prove anything.","Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.","It's just a tree.","It can't call anyone.","For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here.","There's someone in there!","He's bending the vines!","He's the Avatar.","Stuff like that happens to us a lot.","See, completely reasonable.","Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home.","Nothing mystical about it.","Sure you did.","It seems real chatty.","Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to find Appa and Momo.","Huu?","Tastes just like arctic hen.","So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa?","You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.","Nice Slim!","Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here.","Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp.","I told you, we were hungry.","I'm eating a giant bug!","That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count.","The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down.","Well, no accounting for weather.","Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp.","What are you doing in my mouth?","Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.","Come on!","Come on!","Come on!","Wait, my boomerang!","Oh, I see, so there's time to get your scrolls and time to get your staff, but no time for my boomerang?","Oh.","I feel like I've lost part of my identity.","Imagine if you lost your arrow, or Katara lost her ... hair loopies.","I used to be boomerang guy ... And here comes Avatar Roku!","And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food!","Now a torch, that's a nice prop.","It's bright, dangerous ... smells manly.","But I'm not sure I could carry it off.","So some people don't like you, big deal!","There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you.","Now let's bust you out of here!","Sure you can!","A little swish-swish-swish!","Airbending slice!","And we're on our way!","How're we gonna to do that?","The crime happened over three hundred years ago.","Well, I guess I could be classified as such.","Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots!","See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks.","Okay, I guess I am pretty good.","Fine!","But I'm going to need some new props.","I'm ready.","What?","This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone.","And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.","Shhh!","I wanna solve it!","That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple!","You're right.","We need to go to Kyoshi Island.","They say it was Kyoshi.","So, uh ... what's Suki up to?","Is she around?","Oh, well ... that's great.","These fans ...","They were her weapons, no?","Special outfit?","Hat and pipe?","These things mean anything to you?","Aha!","There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint.","And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene.","Three hundred and seventy years?","Wait, are you sure it was today?","This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise.","It took place at sun''set''.","Look at the shadows.","If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime.","She has an alibi!","You can do it, Aang.","Just remember the evidence.","The footprint!","He's dead.","What are you doing?","I do believe in the power of stuff.","Boomerang!","You do always come back!","What is this?","This is by far the worst town we've ever been to.","It's pricey ... but I really do like it.","I do, don't I?","But no, it's too expensive.","I shouldn't.","You know what?","I'm gonna get it.","Oh, I got to remember that one!","What was I thinking?","I don't need a new bag!","Why did you let me buy this?","I guess that's why.","That's what I paid for.","Go back to the Fire Nation!","Yeah!","Wooo!","The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt!","Yeah!","Woohoo!","Go Aang!","Avenge The Boulder!","Boo!","No talking!","Way to go, champ!","I've got to admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag.","It matches the belt, perfectly.","Nicely done.","Water Tribe.","Don't answer to Twinkle Toes, it's not manly!","Look, we all have to do our part to win this war, and yours is to teach Aang earthbending.","Whoever took Aang and Toph left this.","Here's your money.","Now let them go.","I'm trying!","Well, we'd better get out of here, before your dad changes his mind again.","Sorry.","That's not grass.","Appa's shedding.","It's not that bad, Katara.","It makes a great wig!","Your powers of perception are frightening.","Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.","Okay, forget about setting up camp.","I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.","Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.","This is a warrior's wolf tail.","Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh?","No Momo, shhh.","Sleepy time.","Oh, don't tell me ...","Always the optimist ... Actually Toph, there's four of us.","I can still fight!","Errrgh!","Oh no, the sun is rising.","We've been up all night with no sleep!","Yes ... sleep.","Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them.","The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.","Wait!","Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.","No problem.","Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?","Toph couldn't have made it too far.","What is it, Momo?","Ooooh, no!","Katara!","Appa, come on, we need to go faster!","We made it!","We're safe.","Good try, but no.","How are you doing?","Thanks Appa, I don't know what we'd do without you.","Rock beats airbender!","You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat.","Just a bit closer ... Gotcha!","You are one lucky little meat creature.","You probably think I deserve this, don't you?","Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things.","Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal.","But this time it didn't work out that way.","I admit it ... you're cute.","Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me.","No meat.","Even though meat is so tasty.","Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off!","That's okay, I got it.","Now, come back boomerang.","Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff.","If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm.","Okay?","Ow!","That's all I got.","It's pretty much my whole identity.","Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy.","But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow.","Deal?","Aang!","Thank goodness!","Have you got any meat?","Aggh, stop, stop!","You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!","Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here.","How about it?","Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.","You can't?","Why not?","Uncomfortable?","Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ...","Awkward position, I think I know the feeling.","Hmmm ... how about that.","Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops.","Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.","Really?","He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion.","Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here!","This is really bad!","Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!","Please, don't leave me again.","What are you doing here?","Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment.","So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?","Yeah, no crushing, please.","What's out here?","Orchestra, huh?","Well, la-di-da.","This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about?","We should be making plans.","There's no time for vacations.","Even if you do master all of the elements, then what?","It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation.","Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house?","Knock, knock.","Hello, Fire Lord?","Anybody home?","I don't think so.","We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war.","I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy.","Excuse me.","So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy.","Do you have a more current map?","Ours seems to be a little dated.","What, no Fire Nation?","Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?","Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?","If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation?","A map, maybe?","Then it's settled.","Aang, I do believe it's my turn.","I'd like to spend my vacation at the library!","You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.","Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?","Down there, what's that?","What kind of animal is that?","No, this is the library- look!","It's completely buried.","That fox thingy went in through a window.","I say we climb up there and give it a look.","Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?","What?","No-no-no-no destroying.","We're not into that.","Um ... knowledge for knowledge's sake?","I'm not lying, I'm here with the Avatar, and he's the bridge between our worlds.","He'll vouch for me.","Oh, great spirit, check this out.","Ta-da!","It's a special knot.","That counts as knowledge!","Bright enough to fool you.","Eh, I've seen weirder.","\"The darkest day in Fire Nation history.\"","It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else.","I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day.","This could be promising.","The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here.","That's so unfair!","Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago.","I need to know what happened on the darkest day.","Hello, little weird fox guy.","Um, sure, I guess I'll follow you.","Uh, this is beautiful, but how is it helpful?","Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.","It's not broken.","The sun is behind the moon.","It's a solar eclipse!","It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history.","Now I get it.","Something awful happened on that day.","I don't know what, but I do know why.","Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse.","Sorry.","Fine, you earned it.","We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se.","We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless.","The Fire Lord is going down!","You don't understand.","If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation.","You saw what they did to your library.","They're destructive and dangerous.","We need this information.","But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna to happen.","No, we won't.","If we leave this place, we'll never get the information.","Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover.","Katara, take Momo and get out of here!","Go!","Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be.","I don't have to.","We just need to check every date before Sozin's Comet arrives.","Because after that- well, try not to think about that.","That's it!","The solar eclipse!","It's just a few months away.","Got it.","Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.","That's called Sokka style.","Learn it.","Wait!","Professor, let's go.","We got it.","There's a solar eclipse coming.","The Fire Nation's in trouble now!","Who's going to save our lives now?","We'll never make it out of here.","You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?","Can't you watch where you're ...","Right.","Sorry.","If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.","We're drinking your bending water.","You used this on the swamp guy!","Urch!","Not anymore!","Look!","There's water trapped inside these!","Suit yourself.","It's very thirst quenching though.","Drink cactus juice.","It'll quench ya!","Nothing's quenchier.","It's the quenchiest!","Who lit Toph on fire?","How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?","It's a giant mushroom!","Maybe it's friendly!","Friendly mushroom!","Mushy giant friend!","Why don't we ask the circle birds?","Momo, no!","You've killed us all!","Oh, right.","Bending.","What?!","I didn't steal anything!","Who told you that?","It was you!","You ratted me out!","Take it easy little lady.","I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.","I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice.","And look!","Tastes like rotten penguin meat!","Awww, I feel woozy.","I have a natural curiosity.","What are you doing?","That rock almost crushed me!","I got this one.","I guess my head's not as clear as I thought.","Just get out of here!","Run!","Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library.","Just splash some water on 'em.","Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here.","And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here.","It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.","It's the only way.","I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.","Then to Ba Sing Se we go.","No more distractions.","Well, we are desperate.","Don't you know who this is?","He's the Avatar!","All right, we scammed that lady good!","Is there a problem?","Do I know you?","Suki!","Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then.","Nothing major.","I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.","Are you sure that's a good idea?","Nothing.","I'm glad you're coming.","This is the Serpent's Pass?","I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent.","Huh, I guess they misnamed it.","They've spotted us!","Let's go, let's go!","Suki, are you okay?","You have to be more careful!","Come on!","Suki, you shouldn't sleep there.","Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give away at any moment!","You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself!","Wait!","Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine.","Yeah, it really is.","I know you can.","It's so hard to lose someone you care about.","Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone.","I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.","Who is this guy?","Is he taller than me?","Is he better-looking?","Oh!","I can't.","No, you shouldn't be.","I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass!","Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!","Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering.","Thank you.","Toph, come on, it's just ice!","You're doing great!","Just follow the sound of my voice!","You're almost there!","I'm coming, Toph!","There's the wall!","Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.","What's wrong?","What?","Now?","Can't you hold it in or something?","This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal!","This is a real ... human ... thing!","No, no, I'm good this time.","It's so ... squishy looking.","See you in the big city.","Whoa, hold on.","Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?","So you came along to protect me?","You talk too much.","Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?","That's a good group name.","Very catchy.","Get a hold of yourself, man!","Why are you all looking at me?","So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan?","That's a lot of pressure.","That part I don't mind.","Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!","Ooh!","What you just said!","That's how we're going to take down the drill!","The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders!","It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing!","Sorry.","There!","Toph, come on!","Okay, good luck!","I need a plan of this machine.","Some schematics that show what the inside looks like.","Then we can find its weak points.","That's the point.","I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it.","And when something breaks ...","This'll work.","Thanks!","It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures.","There's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell.","The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces.","If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.","Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans.","We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.","Look, I'm the plan guy.","You two are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys.","Together, we're Team Avatar!","C'mon team.","Don't quit now.","We're ...","I mean, you're almost there.","Do you hear that?","We took it down!","We better get out of here fast!","C'mon brace ... budge!","We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!","And boom!","It all comes crashing down!","The whole world minus the Fire Nation that is.","Good work, Team Avatar!","Now Aang just needs to ... duck!","Hey.","It's rock and water mixed together.","It means our way out!","Katara, keep that up.","The pressure will build up in the drill.","Then when Aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop!","Good technique, little sister!","Keep it up!","Don't forget to breathe!","Just bend the slurry, woman!","Woohoo!","I just want to say, good effort out there today, Team Avatar!","How about ... the Boomeraang Squad!","See it's good because it's got \"Aang\" in it.","Boomer''aang''.","The Aang Gang?","The Fearsome Foursome?","Why?","We're fearsome!","Hey, don't jinx it!","We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon.","Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!","I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.","He's a giant bison!","Where could someone possibly hide him?","Oh.","What's the problem?","It's amazing!","Yes.","We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King, immediately.","Ugh!","Maybe you missed what I said.","We need to talk to the king about the War, it's important.","Yeah, we met a professor from the Ba Sing Se University.","He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is ''absolutely crucial for the Earth King to hear''!","Is that woman deaf?","She only seems to hear every other word I say.","And who're the mean-looking guys in robes?","A month?","I think we would enjoy it more if we weren't staying for so long.","Can't we see the Earth King ''any'' sooner?","Where's the black market?","Who runs it?","Come on, you know!","''Right''.","And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?","Hey, come with me.","So, Pong, what's goin' on with this city?","Why is everyone here so scared here to talk about the war?","Certainly you mean his pet skunk bear.","Aha, but you learned it!","You could teach us!","Avatar Aang, how do you do?","Go on.","But I feel so fancy!","Fire!","Look, I came up with a back-up plan.","We dress Momo like a ghost, okay?","He flies by the guards, creating a distraction.","Then, we blast a hole in the wall- Okay ...","But remember that Momo ghost plan.","I think it's a winner.","Forget about them!","Just keep an eye out for the king.","You know, ''royal'', flowing robe, fancy jewelry.","Thanks for letting us in!","''What'' guy?","Not until we see the king.","You keep their attention while I look for the king.","Aang!","The Earth King!","Hey, let me go!","Why won't you let us talk to the king?","We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!","But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless.","You could lead an invasion ... What's this?","Ahh, poetry.","I am so sorry.","Something struck me in the rear.","I just ... wound up ... here.","They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe.","I am not an oaf.","You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard.","I calls it easy.","Like I paddle my canoe, I'll paddle yours too!","Squish, squash, sling that slang.","I'm always right back at ya, like my ... boomerang!","That's right, I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an \"okka\", young ladies, I rocked ya!","Poetry ... Look, we escaped from the Dai Li.","We got Appa back.","I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan.","We're on a roll.","We can build on it.","If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we'll need the Earth King's support.","I know, but I've got a good feeling about this.","This time will be different.","See?","Aang's with me.","It's the whole reason we came here in the first place.","We have to try.","That's probably the Dai Li searching for us.","So?","There it is!","That whole thing is the palace!","The Earth King's chamber should be in the center!","Why would you assume that?","If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and- Aahh!","Surface-to-air rocks!","More incoming!","Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side!","Sorry.","In there!","Toph, which way to the Earth King?","Sorry.","Wrong door.","Now that's an impressive door.","It's gotta go somewhere.","Yaaah!","A little warning next time?","No, we're on your side.","We're here to help.","But we dropped our weapons.","We're your allies.","Uh, no.","Him.","Wait!","I can prove he's lying.","Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison.","Ask him to lift his robe.","Never met a sky bison, huh?","Of course there is!","Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness.","To the Dai Li's secret headquarters.","You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.","Oh don't tell me- !","That's okay.","Still got my positive attitude.","Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.","If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa.","It's a drill.","A giant drill made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls.","Looks like Long Feng is long gone!","Ha!","Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one.","That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness: because we think you can help us end the war.","But there is hope.","Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity: A solar eclipse is coming.","The sun will be completely blocked out by the moon, and the firebenders will be helpless.","That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation.","The Day of Black Sun.","You're already vulnerable.","The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls.","You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance.","Oh.","What?","That could be Dad!","What's a guru?","Some kind of poisonous blow fish?","This is all such big news!","Where do we even start?","Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion.","I guess that's me.","You are the nicest ... sister ... ever!","All right.","Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip?","That's Suki!","Oh yeah.","The Kyoshi Warriors are a skilled group of fighters.","Trustworthy too.","They're good friends of ours.","Aahh!","Great.","That's enough.","Okay, we love each other.","Seriously.","You see, Aang?","A little positive thinking works wonders.","We got the king on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.","Everything is gonna work out perfectly.","From now on and forever.","I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach.","So what about you?","Are you nervous to meet this guru?","Hi, Dad.","Destructive?","Buoyant?","And ... Aggh, ehhh!","Terrible smelling!","Good one, Dad!","Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad?","You don't know how much this means to me, Dad.","I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am.","Really?","This can't be good news.","So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?","It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.","What is that?","Need a ride?","Aang, are you okay?","See, Aang?","She's with Suki.","They're probably back at our apartment right now talking about make-up or something.","Oh, no!","Whoa there!","You lost me at \"Zuko\".","\"Good inside him\" isn't enough!","Why don't you come back when it's ''outside'' him too, okay?","My sister!","Where are they keeping Katara?","We should split up.","Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk, no offense.","And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup.","There's General How!","The coup is happening right now!","We've gotta warn the Earth King!","Thank goodness we're in time!","Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.","Nope, all clear.","Let's go.","After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety.","We flew back to Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men.","The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone.","Well, not completely alone.","Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships.","Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise.","Since then we've been traveling west.","We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago.","We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us.","So we're planning a smaller invasion.","Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom.","We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.","And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage!","We have a secret... You!","Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead!","Isn't that great?","No, it's great!","It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore!","And even better, they won't be expecting you on the Day of Black Sun!","Aang, no!","You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret!","Just let us handle this.","Things couldn't get much worse.","The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?","Thank you, the universe!","Here, tie this around your head.","It will cover your arrow.","Aang, come on.","Be practical.","We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse.","Sh!","Keep quiet!","Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut.","Hey, we're in enemy territory.","Those are enemy birds.","Well, this is it.","This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins.","Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ... Looks like we got outvoted, sport.","Let's get some new clothes.","Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat.","Even the meat!","After ''what''?!","Enrolled in ''what''?!","Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible.","Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous.","Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days.","Flamey-O?","Fire.","Wang Fire.","This is my wife, Sapphire.","Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster.","I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce!","Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!","That settles it!","No more school for you, young man!","What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?","Go to your room!","I can't believe we're having a dance party.","It seems so ... silly.","Wow, they look pretty good together.","Oh, no I can't.","It's permanently glued to my skin.","Flamey-O sir, flamey-O.","Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook!","Get it?","Like a fishing hook?","Hmmm ...","It's doable.","But that means only two potty breaks today.","It's in the middle of the river!","No, we can't waste our time here.","We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on.","These people are on their own.","I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic.","We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into.","We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord.","Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this.","You know our mission has to come first.","Hey, Dock.","You work here too?","We'll just take the fish.","Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore?","Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule.","It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track.","Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day.","Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse, which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes.","And we just lost a whole day.","So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!","Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.","I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.","Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient.","Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning.","What?","Appa's sick?","That's awful!","Of course I care.","I might as well just throw our schedule away now.","And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well.","Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?","See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them.","All we need is medicine for our sick friend.","I guess you're right.","You got any more food to sell?","Two-headed!","What?","You get more for your money that way!","Hi, Dock.","Is Xu around?","And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along.","Well, I hope she returns every night.","Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was.","Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves.","If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory.","Oh, really?","A morning walk?","I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him purpleising tongue berries!","Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy.","We're leaving right now!","And how long did you know about this?","What did you do?","You ''what''?","I was joking!","I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises!","Did you even think this through?","The army is gonna blame the villagers!","They're headed there right now to get revenge!","Leave!","Do nothing!","Wait!","I'm coming, too.","You need me, and I will never turn my back on you.","Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you.","Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone.","You should be down on your knees thanking her!","You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?","Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are.","Oh man, you've ''never ''not seen anything like this.","What should I do?","Right.","Staying clear, got it.","Boo-hoo, poor heroes.","It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and making other stuff fly around.","I can't fly around, okay?","I can't ''do'' anything.","Look, I appreciate the effort, but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special and I'm ... not.","I'm just the guy in the group who's regular.","You do?","Shopping!","Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling.","Hey, how about these?","Ooh!","''That's'' what Sokka's talking about.","A sword?","It would be nice to be a master sword fighter.","All right, I'll talk to him.","I've come to train with the master.","Well, uhh ... Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.","Oh, uh, really, uh where I come from, the Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name... for Fire Nation colonials.","Well, actually, I've been all over the world.","And I know one thing for sure: I have a lot to learn.","I know.","Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth.","But the truth is...","I don't know if I am worthy.","Like a second head.","I am?","I am!","So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?","I'm finished!","Hm, manipulate them to my advantage ... oh!","Thanks.","That warms my heart.","Anyway, I need some help.","I'm sorry, Master.","You're wrong.","I am not worthy.","I'm not who you think I am.","I'm not from the Fire Nation.","I'm from the Southern Water Tribe.","I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you.","I'm sorry.","No, this is my fight, alone.","It's a Pai Sho tile.","I have no idea.","Ooh, that reminds me!","Toph, I thought you might like this since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before.","This is crazy!","How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?","As a matter of fact, they do not.","Then what ''was'' the point?","Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ...","Sneak Attack!","Yes!","Look at all those messenger hawks!","You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself.","That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone.","I could just send them messages.","She used earthbending to win the game!","Classic!","Speaking of that \"third-eyed freak\", I think I've come up with a name for him.","What do you think of \"Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man\"?","Just think about it.","Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some.","See you guys later.","Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar.","My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting.","Good little messenger hawky.","Who's got pretty feathers?","You're right, Hawky.","This is bad.","Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like.","It's a wanted poster.","Of you.","They've nicknamed you the Runaway.","Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good.","But, Toph, you're missing the point.","Maybe Katara was right.","These scams are drawing too much attention to us.","Well, that is true.","I had this idea of making armor for Appa.","I do like expensive atlases.","Not just a bird, a messenger bird.","Now we can send messages all over the world.","Even to Gran Gran.","Hm.","Uh, I never actually thought about that.","Hawky, Gran Gran, South Pole.","I think he gets it.","Hawky!","Make nice!","Bad Hawky!","Hey.","I'm staying out of this one.","I know, Hawky.","Why can't they just get along?","Hey, Aang.","You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me?","I've got an idea.","I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize.","Then everyone will be friends again.","It's a gift.","\"Dear Katara, sorry for everything.","Your friend, Toph.\"","Yup.","We're idiots.","I think we're gonna run into a similar problem.","Sorry, Hawky.","Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help.","Come on.","We need to talk.","Nah, she's pretty much a pain.","She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ... Actually, in a way, I rely on it.","When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life.","Our family was a mess, but Katara?","She had so much strength.","She stepped up and took on so much responsibility.","She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.","I'm gonna tell you something crazy.","I never told anyone this before, but honestly?","I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like.","It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me.","She's always been the one that's there.","And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture.","Hey, my lips are sealed.","I was just wondering the same thing.","We'd better check it out.","You two behave.","Appa's in charge.","Where do you think they might be?","You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.","This guy is too good!","He shoots fire from his brain!","Hey, I got it!","The perfect name for that guy: \"Combustion Man!\"","See?","It fits so well!","Well, I'm exhausted.","Hawky, how about you, buddy?","Yeah.","You're such a lazy little bird.","Hey, where'd Hawky go?","Is this one of those \"a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to\" stories?","Where'd she go?","Pfft!","Nice try.","Yes, please.","What do you mean \"disappearing\"?","I know, Momo.","This place is creepy!","I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep!","People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons?","This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans.","And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!","This is a mysterious little town you have here.","That Hama seems a little strange.","Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.","But what did she mean by that comment, \"mysterious children\"?","I'm gonna take a look around.","It'll be fine.","I'm not finished yet.","Come on ... Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh?","Well then why does she have a locked door up here?","We'll see.","It's empty, except for a little chest.","I have to see what's in there.","Maybe there's a key here somewhere ... Come on, come on!","Suit yourself!","Do it, Toph!","An old comb?","But why didn't you tell us?","And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right.","But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.","So how did you end up out here?","How did you get away?","And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?","The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady.","She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!","We wanted to ask you about that.","Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?","I can't see anything down there.","A witch?","What do you mean?","Hama!","I knew there was something creepy about her!","We know what you've been doing, Hama!","Katara, look out!","It's like my brain has a mind of its own!","Stop it arm, stop it!","This is it!","The official rendezvous point for the invasion force.","Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map.","It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.","Whatever.","That's like four days from now.","Let's just calm down and- That's okay, Aang.","The eclipse will block off firebending anyway.","You don't need to know it.","Plus, it's a stupid element.","What?","Who's talking?","What?","But that was just a dream.","I'm a great climber!","Stupid Avatar!","Stupid cliff!","Stupid dream!","I can climb fast!","Of course you are.","That's 'cause you gotta fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet.","And you better win or we're all done for.","What?","It's true.","That's the deal.","He knows it.","Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.","Tell me more about this \"Fire Lord\".","Why are you so afraid of him?","Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it?","Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.","Want to try screaming into this pillow?","Then our work here is done.","Looks like it's time for another ... therapy session.","Hey!","I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked.","He's ''your'' bison.","You've been awake too long.","About what?","We made it for you.","A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away.","We hope.","We all do.","You can do this.","You're ready.","No.","That ''is'' the invasion!","Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find?","Was that a new invention?","You're making peanut sauce bombs?","Where you able to complete work on the plans I send you?","Good morning everyone.","Ahh!","Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation!","I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here?","Uh anyway, the Fire Lord's palace is here .","Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here, and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us!","And ... um ...","I'm sorry let me start at the beginning .","Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki, who's a Kyoshi warrior.","She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ... ... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ...","I messed up, Aang.","The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it.","I just fell apart.","My dad is!","He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should.","You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?","Well, I just came up with the idea.","The mechanist did all the work.","Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive?","Katara, what are you doing?","It's time to submerge.","Dad, look out!","I've got an idea.","Dad!","Can't you heal him any faster?","I'll do it.","No.","I'll lead the invasion force.","Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does.","Yip yip.","Listen up, everyone.","I want the tanks in wedge formation.","Warriors and benders in the middle.","We're taking that tower, and heading for the royal palace.","Charge!","Dad!","You're on your feet again.","Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.","What?","Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down.","The mechanist gave me this timing device.","It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse.","Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord.","What do you think?","You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord.","Whatever you decide, I'm with you.","Anything else?","Is there a structure somewhere?","Sounds like a secret bunker to me.","What would we do without you?","We'll have to be fast, but careful.","I was wrong.","We need to be fast, careful and lucky.","There's no floor.","It's just a river of lava.","That's some door!","I am so glad we added you to the group!","Only thirty seconds until the total eclipse.","Stop wasting our time and give us the information.","You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse.","Wait!","Aang!","Toph!","Stop attacking!","Don't you see what she's doing?","She's just playing with us.","She's not even trying to win this fight!","She's just baiting you again.","We don't have a choice.","We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.","Ignore!","Where.","Is.","Suki?!","Where's Suki?","Answer me!","Where are you keeping her?","I fell for it!","I used up all our time.","And now it's too late.","No.","I don't think that's a good idea.","You'll have another chance.","I know you will.","It was all a trap!","Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move!","We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can.","If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.","Everyone, let's get back to the subs!","Try and find cover!","I think we're about to see some bombs!","How are we all going to escape?","Then our only choice is to stand and fight.","We have the Avatar, we could still win.","They're at the beach already!","Bye, Dad.","We won't be apart for too long this time.","I promise.","You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?","I miss not having blisters on my feet.","Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan!","You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.","There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending.","Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future!","Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.","Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang!","He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him.","I'm not buying it.","Like when you attacked our village?","Ohhh, sorry.","I didn't mean to insult your friend!","Either you leave, or we attack.","Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.","He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes.","And you made us suck on frozen frogs?","How could I forget?","I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!","I could feel it!","It's my throatal flap!","Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him.","Oh, hooray!","In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.","Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island!","You're darn right you're not, buddy.","I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.","Let her have fun with her rocks.","I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.","Uhhh ...!","So he attacked you?","See?","You trusted Zuko, and you got burned.","Literally!","Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone.","We're gonna have to go after him.","He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him.","Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and ''really'' make him our prisoner.","He'll never suspect it!","I know how to get an angle on him!","All right buddy, don't fail me now!","Yeah, boomerang!","Awww, boomerang ... Hey, what about me?","I did the boomerang thing.","Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord.","If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it.","Hey, jerks!","Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?","Okay, take it easy.","I was just kiddin' around.","Jerkbending, still got it.","Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry.","Easy enough.","So, what?","Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing where they stood a thousand years ago?","Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.","We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.","Hey, can I talk to you for a second?","If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?","When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken.","I just want to know where they might be.","What?","Why not?","It's my dad.","He was captured too.","I need to know what I put him through.","Please.","What's that?","So, where is this place?","Nothing.","Boy, you're so paranoid.","Thanks, Zuko.","Just knowing makes me feel better.","Shhh.","Fine, you caught me.","I'm gonna rescue my dad.","You happy now?","Look, I ''have'' to do this.","The invasion plan was ''my'' idea, it was ''my'' decision to stay when things were going wrong.","It's ''my'' mistake, and it's ''my'' job to fix it.","I have to regain my honor.","You can't stop me, Zuko.","No.","I have to do this alone.","Pretty clouds.","What?","Oh, I didn't say anything.","You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.","Yep, a balloon ... but for war.","Yeah, it seems to run in the family.","I know, I know, you've changed.","I think your uncle would be proud of you.","Leaving your home to come help us?","That's hard.","Really?","You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?","That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?","My first girlfriend turned into the moon.","The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!","I don't know!","Crash-landing?","We'll figure something out!","I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.","My dad might be here!","I had to come and see!","Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place!","And for the record, I ''always'' think things through!","But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear.","So there.","It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it.","We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.","We can't blow our cover.","Super cute.","Meet back here in an hour.","Prisoners!","Am I right?","It sure looks cold in there.","Zuko?","What?","Are you sure, did you double-check?","No.","No!","So we came all this way for nothing?","I failed ... again.","Maybe we haven't failed after all!","No, what you said made no sense at all.","But look ...","It's Suki!","You mean you don't recognize me?","The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?","Well, you won't be here for long.","I'm busting you out.","You're under arrest!","Don't worry, I'll figure it out.","Oh, good, you guys have met.","So, listen, I think I have an escape plan.","I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?","So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in.","Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?","It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water.","What?","We didn't ... w-we didn't say that.","Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?","Okay, you're in.","Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside.","I need backup over here!","I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.","I know.","I don't know!","Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?","Fine.","Everybody in the cooler.","Let's go.","If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.","Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.","That supposed to make me feel better?","Seriously, not helping.","No.","I'm staying.","You guys go.","You've been here long enough.","We gave up our only chance of escaping.","I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.","The plan failed!","They're caught!","The gondola's moving.","This is it.","If my dad's not there, we've risked everything for nothing.","Come on, come on ... My dad doesn't have a nose ring.","Where is he?","That's it?","That can't be it.","Oh, no.","Dad ... Dad ...","Excuse me, coming through.","The warden wants me over there.","Sorry!","Thank goodness you're okay.","Dad, it's me.","Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.","You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?","Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.","And you know Prince Zuko?","Well, he's here too.","Actually, he's on our side now.","I know.","I had the same reaction.","After all he's done, it was hard to trust him.","But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help.","We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it.","I dunno if there's another way off this island.","Then we'd better find two.","Zuko, are you there?","I just got done talking to my dad.","We came up with an escape plan together.","I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!","Why?","Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit?","Take that ... and this!","I don't have much time.","If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up.","I just talked to my dad.","Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola.","My dad and I came up with the plan together.","We're gonna commandeer the gondola and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.","My dad already thought of that.","He said we'll need a distraction.","That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.","Not if the warden ''is'' the captive.","I have to go.","I'll find you before we start the riot.","Why?","Maybe I could schedule another time with him?","How's tomorrow?","Hey, I just got orders.","Let the prisoners out into the yard.","Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says.","This is it!","We have to start a riot.","This isn't working.","Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot.","You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?","Zuko!","Good, we're all here.","Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas!","I'm not sure.","I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!","Tell me about it.","What are you doing?","Way to think ahead.","Who's that?","Zuko, what are you doing?","Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop!","I did.","The best meat of all.","The meat of friendship and fatherhood.","We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.","Come on!","We've gotta get out of here!","We need to split up.","Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.","To Zuko!","Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?","What's with her?","What's with him?","Well, hello ...","Uh, Zuko!","Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different?","So what's on your mind?","Nah, she doesn't hate you.","Katara doesn't ''hate'' anyone.","Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation.","No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad.","I mean, bad people.","Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!","What?","Why would you want to know that?","It's not a day I like to remember.","Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid.","We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off.","As quickly as they came, they just left.","I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened.","I didn't know we had lost our mother.","Yeah ... sea ravens.","The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.","No problem.","Thanks for stopping by!","I'd thought he'd never leave.","Suki!","Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right.","Katara!","You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.","Usually it's annoying, but right now, I'm impressed.","So, can I borrow Momo for a week?","You guys are not gonna believe this!","There's a play about us.","Listen to this ... \"''The Boy in the Iceberg'' is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu-on Tim, who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar, from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.","His sources include singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war, and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage.\"","Shhh!","I'm trying to watch!","Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time!","I know!","You know, it was really unclear.","Oh, you're getting up?","Can you get me some fire flakes?","Ooh, and fire gummies!","You're one to talk, Suki.","Didn't Azula take you captive?","That's right, she did!","I'm just saying ...","He left to get me fire gummies, like, ten minutes ago.","And I'm still waiting!","Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage?","I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me.","Actually, I think I can help you.","I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be.","Just hear me out.","Here's something I think the real Sokka would say.","What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages?","A cabbage patch!","Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases, especially before an attack.","Something like ... \"Flying kick-a-pow!\".","I'm just a guy who likes comedy.","Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died.","Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start!","Shhh!","I told him to say that!","I guess that's it.","The play's caught up to the present now.","But it is over, unless ... this is the future.","But the effects were decent.","Maybe Zuko's right.","Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy.","But I know just the thing to change all that.","Beach party!","Ta da!","No, it's Suki!","Zuko's gone crazy!","I made a sand sculpture of Suki and he destroyed it!","Oh, and he's attacking Aang.","Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord now, he's going to lose.","No offense.","I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil.","All right!","Team Avatar is back!","Air.","Water.","Earth.","Fire.","Fan and sword!","All right.","Gather round, Team Avatar.","In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect.","First, Suki and I will draw his fire.","Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense, and while the Melon Lord is distracted, Aang swoops in ... and bam!","He delivers the final blow.","For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.","Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.","Watch it, Toph!","Now, Aang!","What's wrong with you?","If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now.","There, that's how it's done.","Sure you can.","You're the Avatar.","If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you.","Okay, that's everything.","He left his staff.","That's so strange.","Look, there's his footprints.","The trail ends here.","I don't think so.","There's no sign of a struggle.","Uh-uh.","He left behind his glider and Appa.","It's pretty obvious.","Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle?","He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.","Oh, yeah.","Forgot about that.","Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either.","Oh no!","I knew it was only a matter of time!","Appa ate Momo!","Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy.","That's just what Appa wants you to think.","Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom?","There's no way Aang's there.","Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.","No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on.","Hey, I remember her!","She helped you attack us!","What do you mean Aang doesn't exist?","Do you mean he's ... you know, dead?","You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal?","Ugh!","Welcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp!","How about Grand-Pakku?","Master Piandao.","He's gone.","And so is Aang.","So, Bumi ... how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?","No, not really.","What about us?","What's our destiny today?","I think that, even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet.","Thank you, Master.","We're too late!","The fleet's already taking off!","It's right ... Sshhh ... Good work, Toph!","Time to take control of the ship, take the wheel.","I was talking to Suki.","Take us down closer to the water.","I've got an idea.","Attention, crew, this is your captain speaking.","Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and sweet cream.","We have a very special birthday to celebrate.","Fire Lord Ozai, here we come.","We're not gonna catch up to him in time.","It's Aang!","He's back!","Go, Aang!","Airbending slice!","The Fire Lord is Aang's fight.","We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom.","It's gonna be a rough ride!","We need to get to the top of this thing, ''fast.''","Watch each other's backs, and if we make it that far, I'll let you know.","Suki!","Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position.","The ship will spiral and slam into the others.","Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?","My leg!","Hang on Toph!","Bye, space sword.","I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph.","It looks like this is the end.","No, Suki did.","You did it!","You should've seen yourself, it was amazing!","You were all like and the Fire Lord was all like Well, look at you, buster.","Now that your firebending's gone I guess we should call you the Loser Lord.","There's my favorite warriors!","I have to admit, I kind of missed the face paint.","So how does it feel to be in uniform again?","Careful, Suki!","Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again.","Zuko, stop moving!","I'm trying to capture the moment.","I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together.","Those are your hair loopies!","I thought it looked more exciting that way.","Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo?"]},"Katara":{"combined_dialog":["Sokka, look!","But, Sokka!","I caught one!","Hey!","You're calling ''me'' weird?","I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!","Watch out!","Go left!","Go left!","You call that ''left?''","So it's my fault?","Ever since mom died, ''I've'' been doing all the work around camp while ''you've'' been off playing soldier!","I even wash all the clothes!","Have you ever smelled your dirty socks?","Let me tell you, ''not pleasant!''","No that's it!","I'm ''done'' helping you!","From now on, you're ''on your own!''","You mean ''I ''did that?","He's alive!","We have to help!","Stop it!","What?","What is it?","Uh, sure ...

Come on, let's get out of here.","Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy.","Aaah!","Water.","Earth.","Fire.","Air.","Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.","Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.","Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.","A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang.","And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.","But I believe Aang can save the world.","Aang didn't do anything!","It was an accident.","Sokka, you're making a mistake.","Aang is ''not'' our enemy!","Don't you see?","Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun.","Grandmother, please.","''Don't'' let Sokka do this!","Fine!","Then I'm banished, too!","Come on Aang, let's go.","To find a waterbender.","Aang is taking ''me'' to the North Pole.","So, you're leaving the South Pole?","This is goodbye?","Where will you go?","You happy now?","There goes my ''one ''chance at becoming a waterbender!","Sokka, get out of the way!","Aang?","No!","Aang, ''don't'' do this!","We have to go after that ship, Sokka.","Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him.","Why can't you realize that he's on our side?","If we don't help him, no one will.","I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and -- Sokka!","He's not my -- There's no way we're going to catch a warship with a ''canoe.''","Appa!","Please, Appa.","We need your help.","''Aang'' needs your help.","Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.","Come on, don't you want to save Aang?","You did it, Sokka!","Aang!","No!","Aang!","Aang!","Aang!","Did you see what he just did?!","Aang!","Are you okay?","Hurry up, Sokka!","How did you do that?!","With the water?","It was the most ''amazing'' thing I've ''ever'' seen!","Why didn't you tell us ''you'' were the Avatar?","But Aang, the world's been ''waiting'' for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.","According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?","Well, if we go to the North Pole, you can master waterbending!","Then we're in this together!","What's there?","Aang, I know you're excited, but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.","It's just that ... a lot can change in all that time.","Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders.","Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see.","The Fire Nation is ruthless.","They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people.","I know it's hard to accept.","Aang, it's amazing!","You're lucky enough to be one of the'' first'' outsiders to ''ever'' visit an airbender temple, and all you can think about is food?","What's wrong?","Fire Nation.","Aang!","There's something you need to see.","Uh ... Just a new waterbending move I learned.","I can for Aang's sake.","If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated.","You must miss him.","Where are you going?","But Aang, no one could have survived in there for a hundred years.","Good point.","Who are all these people?","And this one's a waterbender.","They're lined up in a pattern: air, water, earth and fire.","Of course.","They're Avatars.","All these people are your past lives, Aang.","It's true.","When the Avatar dies, he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.","Aang!","Snap out of it!","Who is that?","There's no writing.","How do you know his name?","You're making a sound!","Aang!","What happened?","Oh no!","It's his Avatar Spirit!","He must have triggered it!","I'm going to try and calm him down!","It's okay.","It wasn't your fault.","Everything's packed.","You ready to go?","Maybe you'll find a way.","What are you going to name him?","That's great, Aang.","That's great!","All done with your pants!","And look what a great job I did!","He's right.","At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring.","Whooh!","He looks pretty good out there.","No, Appa.","Don't eat that!","What's wrong?","Get out of there!","What was that thing?","No, don't hurt him!","He didn't mean it.","My brother is just an idiot sometimes.","Aang ... do some airbending.","Well, maybe just a bite.","He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.","Right.","And ''then'' they kicked your butt.","Hey, don't get too comfortable.","It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.","Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar.","I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.","Oh, good!","Can you help me carry this back to the room?","It's a little heavy.","What do you mean, \"you can't?\"","Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does ''not'' sound like fun.","It's not ''my'' basket.","These supplies are for our trip.","I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.","Aangy ... \"Simple monk\", huh?","I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.","That's ridiculous.","Yeah.","Nope.","Have fun.","Great.","I'm glad you know.","Good!","I wanted to make sure you were safe.","You really had me worried.","I'm sorry.","Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!","Hang on, Aang!","Aang!","Zuko!","Wake up, Aang!","Get inside.","It's not your fault.","Then let's get out of here.","Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us.","I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.","I know it's hard, but you did the right thing.","Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed.","They're going to be okay, Aang.","Yes, it was.","Wait, Aang!","It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.","Technically, Aang is 112 years old.","Hi.","June Pippinpaddleopsicopolis.","Nice to meet you.","We will!","It sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second th-o-o-oughts!","Aang, do something!","Use your airbending!","Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?","You can't keep us here!","Let us leave!","This is a prison cell?","But it's so nice.","We're not sticking around to find out.","There's got to be some way out of here.","Well, no point arguing about it now.","Get some rest, Aang.","Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.","Other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body, doing great!","Think about the challenges.","Maybe it's some kind of riddle.","We're going to keep trying, but that is a good back-up.","And what did you learn?","And?","Uh, over here!","So this crazy king is your old friend Bumi?","Seriously ... what else you got?","An earthbender!","Hello there!","I'm Katara!","What's your name?","I just wanted to say hi.","Which means no nuts for dinner!","Hey ... Hey.","You're that kid.","Why did you run away before?","But, Haru's an earthbender?","He can help!","How can you say that?","Haru has a gift!","Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend.","It's a part of who we are.","I understand that Haru can help you fight back.","What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?","I'm sorry about what I said earlier.","I didn't know about your father.","Thanks.","He sounds like a great man.","So that's why you hide your earthbending.","See this necklace?","My mother gave it to me.","I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid.","This necklace is all I have left of her.","No.","Ugh!","It's not working!","We have to get help!","Haru.","There's a way ''you'' can help him.","Please, there's no one around to see you.","It's the only way!","Haru!","You did it!","It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.","I guess so.","Dawn?!","Can't we sleep in for once?","I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.","The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending!","Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.","We don't need to track him.","The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.","Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.","Aang?","Did you get all that?","How ''dare'' you call me pipsqueak, you giant-eared cretin!","A giant-eared cretin!","Look at those things!","Do herds of animals use them for shade?!","I will not back off!","I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large ''your'' ears are!","I'll show ''you'' who's boss!","Earthbending style!","I said, ''earthbending style''!","Haru!","It's my fault you were captured.","I came to rescue you.","It was the only way to find you.","It's an honor to meet you.","If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?","You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig?","What is it?","Mutiny, sabotage?","How can you say that?","You sound like you've already given up!","We'll see about that.","Earthbenders!","You don't know me, but I know of you.","Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.","Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless.","Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend.","But they can't take away your ''courage''.","And it is your courage they should truly fear!","Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home!","It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are.","Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away.","The time to fight back is now!","I can tell you the Avatar has returned!","So remember your courage earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!","I can't.","I'm not leaving.","I'm not giving up on these people.","We can't abandon these people!","There has to be a way to help them.","No!","I tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but, it didn't work!","If there was just a way to help them help themselves.","But this entire place is made of metal!","It's almost dawn.","We're running out of time!","You sure this is gonna work?","Here's your chance, earthbenders!","Take it!","Your fate is in your own hands!","All it took was a little coal.","So, I guess you're going home now.","I can't.","Your mission is to take back your home.","Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.","I know.","My mother's necklace!","It's gone!","Hey, what is that?","Aang?","Are you okay?","Shhh!","Aang, you didn't let this happen.","It has nothing to do with you.","That's why we're going to the North Pole.","To find you a teacher.","Hey, Aang!","You ready to be cheered up?","These acorns are everywhere, Aang.","That means the forest will grow back!","Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.","What happens then?","Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second?","Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this.","So ... can you help these people?","I think you can do it, Aang.","Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.","Sokka, wait!","Sokka!","I know.","Everything's going to be okay ...","It's okay, Appa, don't worry.","I'm sure they're on their way back.","I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.","It's no use, Appa.","I don't seem them anywhere.","Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.","You're back!","Where's Sokka?","Aang, what are you doing?!","Run!","Sokka!","You were trapped in the Spirit World for 24 hours!","How are you feeling?","Sokka!","I'm so proud of you, Aang.","You figured out what to do, all on your own.","That's great!","But the solstice is tomorrow!","Please don't go Aang.","The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation.","Neither can I.","We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.","Aang.","We've got trouble!","Fireball!","We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us!","There's no time!","And that's ''exactly'' why we're here.","Aww, you must be tired.","I was talking to Appa.","The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.","That's when we were at the Air Temple.","Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!","Can't you just open them with firebending?","Like you opened that other door?","You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.","It's almost sunset.","Are you ready?","Aang!","Stop!","There's nothing else we can do ... Sokka, you're a genius!","You're right.","Sokka's plan ''didn't'' work.","But it ''looks'' like it did.","Aang!","Now's your chance!","Go!","He made it!","How's Aang gonna make it out of this?","No!","Aang!","''Not'' without Aang!","I don't know.","Calm down, it's going to be okay.","If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know.","We'll need to find a good source of water first.","Remember the reason we're here.","This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect.","So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away.","Just push and pull the water like this.","The key is getting the wrist movement right.","Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.","It took me two months to learn that move.","Thanks.","This is a more difficult move.","I call it streaming the water.","It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if- Nice work.","Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.","Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard.","I haven't even totally figured it out yet.","The idea is to create a big, powerful wave.","That's enough practicing for today.","No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.","Look at this, Aang.","It's a waterbending scroll!","Check out these crazy moves.","So, how much for the, uh, ''traded'' scroll?","Aang, can we get out of here?","I feel like we're getting weird looks.","I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.","I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us.","Aang!","I thought we were running ''away'' from the pirates!","I know.","That's why I took this.","Isn't it great?","I prefer to think of it as high risk trading.","Sokka, where do you think ''they'' got it?","They stole it from a waterbender!","These are ''real'' waterbending forms.","You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending!","I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours.","Here, hold it open for me.","The single water whip.","Looks doable.","Ow!","What's so funny?","Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip.","Ugh, why can't I get this stupid move?","Will you please shut your air hole?","Believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes!","Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted!","What?","Oh my gosh, Aang, I am so sorry, I don't know what came over me.","But you know what, it won't happen again.","Here, this is yours.","I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.","I'm sorry, Momo.","No more apologies!","Shhh, Momo!","Go back to sleep.","Shh!","Ugh, ugh, ugh!","Shoot!","Come on water, work with me here!","Okay, what if I just, ow!","Stupid scroll!","Okay Katara, shift your weight through the stances.","No!","Let go of me!","Go jump in the river!","My mother's necklace!","How did you get that?","No!","Aang, this is all ''my'' fault.","Thanks, Momo.","I owe you a bushel of apples.","Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here.","Everybody in!","I couldn't have done it without your help.","Aang, look!","We can stop the boat!","Aang, together, push and pull the water!","It's working, it's slowing down!","We're doing it!","Aang, I still owe you an apology.","You were just so good at waterbending without really trying.","I got so competitive that I put us all in danger, I'm sorry.","Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway?","The scroll!","Stealing is wrong.","Unless it's from pirates.","Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?","Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp ''on top'' of the tent.","You know, so we don't get rained on?","But what if it does rain?","You're infuriating!","Well, if you don't like my firewood- Oh yeah?","Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the Tents!","Sounds good.","Wow, I could just stare at it forever.","How can you not be fascinated Sokka?","This is the largest canyon in the entire world.","Ooh, canyon guide?","Sounds informative.","You're a refugee!","Is that your tribe?","Uh, one of them, I think.","Well Aang, ready to put your peace-making skills to the test?","Everybody listen up!","This is the Avatar, and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.","He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job.","Your arms, they're broken!","You really think it'll rain?","So it was you guys who had food!","Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.","So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much?","I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins.","They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb.","Not punished enough if you ask me.","Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers.","Sokka, wait.","I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive.","You did ''not''!","That is ''so'' wrong.","We need you, Aang.","Are you all right, Aang?","You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately.","You want to tell me about it?","Well, we better ''smoothly'' fly ourselves to a market, 'cause we're out of food.","I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.","I just realized we're out of money anyway.","You could get a job, smart guy.","That's right.","Don't yell at him!","Aang would never turn his back on anyone.","Aang is the bravest person I know.","He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.","It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang?","Aang, what's wrong?","You're a horrible old man!","Appa, yip yip!","It's okay.","That fisherman was ''way'' out of line.","What do you mean?","It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?","Talk to me.","I'm going to try to get a little fire going.","So you were upset that you were the Avatar?","Why wouldn't you be excited about it?","That's awful, Aang.","I don't know what to say.","Whoa!","Hot cinders!","You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.","You ran away.","You don't know what would have-.","Aang ... You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away.","I think it was meant to be.","If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.","I know it was meant to be this way.","The world needs you now.","You give people hope.","It's okay.","You're safe.","What do you mean?","Where's Sokka?","I'm going with you!","Where are they?","Really?","I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.","This should bring your fever down.","That's nice.","I'll tell him.","Not so good, being out in that storm really did a number on him.","Aang, he's in no condition for travel.","Sokka just needs more rest.","I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.","Relax, it was just a little cough.","I'm fi- Listen carefully, Momo.","I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water.","Got it?","Momo should be back any minute.","How many times do I have to tell you, Momo?","We need water, wa-ter.","Oh forget it.","Aang, please, hurry.","Look!","Thanks, Aang.","I love it.","So, how do I look?","Stop teasing him, Sokka.","Aang's just a good friend.","A sweet, little guy!","Just like Momo.","Run downhill, then climb a tree!","Wow, it must be.","That explains why you were so calm!","Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes.","It could be fun.","That proves it!","I guess you're not ''really'' getting wet then.","Just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella.","Really?","Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.","There are things in this world that just can't be explained.","Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?","I guess that's me.","Tell me more!","You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.","Well, I liked my predictions.","Certain things are going to turn out very well.","Why?","What did she tell you?","What's with the sky?","Shhh!","She's coming!","Shhh!","Hi, Aunt Wu!","Sorry to bother you.","About this man I'm supposed to marry ... Is he going to be handsome?","Oh, I hope he's tall!","Yes, please!","Wow, thanks, Aunt Wu.","Oh wait, one more thing.","How warmly should I dress tomorrow?","Okay, okay, but one more thing.","Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?","Aww, I hate papaya.","Hey, Aang.","Ugh, papaya please.","Uh huh.","Would you like some?","Okay then.","See you later.","Can you believe she won't let me in?","And after all the business I've given her?","I know, but still ... Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before.","It's going to take an awful lot to change my mind - Oh no.","If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me.","I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.","They just won't listen to reason.","I found it.","The symbol for volcanic doom.","It's too much!","It's gonna overflow!","Wait, what did you just say?","It's okay, Sokka.","Everything's going to be all right.","Goodbye everyone!","It was so nice to meet you!","Take care, Meng.","Did someone lose something?","Wait, look!","Is this dad's boat?","Bato!","Is he here?","Bato, it looks like home!","No way!","Stewed sea prunes!","Bato, is it true that you and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?","Everyone does!","You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.","Really?","I do really miss him, it would be ''great'' to see Dad.","Even if we do have time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel.","We don't have time for a long detour.","Hey, Aang, I didn't notice you left.","He never got to go.","Dad left before he was old enough.","There's no way through!","Of course you can!","Aang, what are you talking about?","I'm with you Sokka.","Good luck.","That wolf sounds so sad.","Sokka?","You're right.","Aang!","We're getting ''you'' to the North Pole.","And ''we'' need you.","I'll be okay.","Aang, how'd you get that?","Aw, that's so sweet of Zuko.","Could you give him a kiss for me when you see him?","So, how long do you think it's been since someone was here?","It's okay Aang.","Our dad left about two years ago, with all the other Water Tribe men.","This should give us a good idea of what's around here.","I think we better keep moving.","We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.","I think we need some new disguises.","\"Flaming fire flakes\", hot?","What do you know?","Aang, hold on!","Where are we going?","It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.","Uh.","It can't hurt just to talk to him.","I'm sure there's a good reason.","Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.","Aang, you'll hurt yourself!","But you're a great master.","You have powers that I will never know.","I'm fine, we've got to get out of here.","Where's Aang?","You'll have to eventually.","It's okay, Aang.","I'm healed.","I'll explain later.","But right now, we have to get out here.","Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!","By the river.","They captured Jeong Jeong.","Aang, you're burned!","Let me help you.","I guess I always knew.","He tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook.","Was it realistic?","Is that how it was back then?","Do you think we'll really find airbenders?","Are you saying I'm a liar?","They really are airbenders!","I don't know, Aang.","That kid seemed pretty spirited.","Aang used to come here a long time ago.","I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different.","I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.","You're right.","They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins.","Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple!","Aang?","I've changed my mind.","I think I was born without that something.","No!","Aaaaah!","I can't believe I'm flying!","Teo was right about the air.","All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me.","Wait!","How do I land this thing?","What if I land over a-ack-ack-bleck!","Bug!","Bug!","Ack, that was a bug!","Aang, what are we going to do?","How can we possibly keep them all away?","Ugh, if only we knew.","Huh, that's actually pretty smart.","Yes.","But where's Sokka with the war balloon?","Those things are unstoppable!","Water?","Can you get me close to one?","Come on Sokka.","Where's that war balloon?","No, Sokka!","Hold on!","Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.","They're waterbenders!","We found the Water Tribe!","The Northern Water Tribe.","I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!","This place is beautiful.","My apologies, ''Prince'' Sokka.","Very smooth ...","I've waited for this day my whole life.","I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!","What do you mean you won't teach me?","I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me no!","But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!","I don't want to heal, I want to fight!","Well, your rules stink!","Wait!","Aang didn't mean that!","You can't risk your training for me.","You have to learn from Master Pakku, even if he is a big jerk.","Uhhh ... Hi.","Are you Yagoda?","I guess I am.","Thanks for the lesson.","Huh?","Ah ... No.","I don't think I'm ready for that yet.","My grandmother gave my mother this necklace and my mother passed it down to me.","Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?","She never told me.","If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?","How's warrior training going?","Why didn't I think of that?","At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learn from Master Pakku!","That way, you have someone to practice with, and I get to learn waterbending!","Everyone's happy!","But you're never happy.","Come on, Aang.","I got it!","That wasn't me.","Yes ... please!","Fine.","No.","No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!","I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me.","I know!","I don't care!","I'm not doing it for you!","Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!","So, you decided to show up?","Aren't you going to fight?","You can't knock me down!","But you still won't teach me, will you?","Come back here.","I'm not finished yet!","No, it's not.","It's mine!","Give it back!","But she didn't love you, did she?","It was an arranged marriage.","Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life.","That's why she left.","It must have taken a lot of courage.","You, too.","Sokka ... Aang!","What happened?","I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.","The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World!","Aang can talk to them!","The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident.","How are you going to get there this time?","It's so warm here!","How is that possible?","He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World.","It takes all his concentration.","He's crossing into the Spirit World.","He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body.","That's his way back to the physical world.","No, he's my friend.","I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.","No ... Aang!","He took Aang.","He took him right out from under me.","Okay.","It's all right.","You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.","I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard.","I'm worried that they won't.","Look, that's gotta be Aang!","Yip-yip!","Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.","It's too late, it's dead.","What about Aang?","He still needs to learn waterbending.","You too, Momo.","Aang ... Do you want to talk about it?","Thank you, Master Pakku.","Say hi to Gran-Gran for me!","Mighty Katara?","I like that.","Aang still needs to master all four elements.","Aang, no!","This is not the right way!","There's a right way to do this.","Practice, study, and discipline!","If you two meat heads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine, go ahead and glow it up!","Can we talk about something?","Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton?","It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you.","I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore.","I'm not saying the Avatar State doesn't have incredible and helpful power ... but you have to understand ... for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary.","I don't understand.","I can't watch you do this to yourself.","I'm not coming tomorrow.","Good night.","I wonder what crazy thing they're trying to do now.","Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay.","What's going on?","I can't move!","Aang, I'm sinking!","Please!","I think we're all set.","Right, let me see your stance.","Your arms are too far apart.","See, if you move them closer together, you protect your center.","You got it?","Okay, let's see what you got.","You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.","We're not river people.","Sokka's right.","We need to find King Bumi, so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.","Is this real or a legend?","That's no campfire, Moku.","It's okay, Appa.","We'll be fine.","I hope.","Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.","Everyone be quiet.","Listen.","Aang, look!","This isn't the exit.","These pictures tell their story.","They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ...","The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ... but their love was strong and they found a way.","They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly.","Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth.","But, one day, the man didn't come - he'd died in the war between the two villages.","Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ... but, instead, she declared the war over.","Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace.","The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu.","The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.","Love is brightest in the dark.","I have a crazy idea.","Never mind.","It's too crazy.","I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ... And here, it says, \"Love is brightest in the dark,\" and has a picture of them kissing.","Well, what if we ... kissed?","See?","It was a crazy idea.","Oh, well!","I didn't realize it was'' such'' a ''horrible'' option.","Sorry I suggested it!","Ugh!","Well, I'm not sure ''which'' I'd rather do!","I think so ... What ''can'' we do?","That's how the two lovers found each other.","They just put out their lights and followed the crystals.","That must be the way out!","Let's go!","Sokka!","Why is your forehead all red?","I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people who can teach you earthbending.","That wasn't as bad as I thought.","Sorry.","We were just on our way home.","Uh, he has pentapox, sir.","Umm, it's highly contagious.","And deadly.","Let's find Bumi and get out of here.","Aang, what are you doing?","Aren't you coming with us?","Oh no.","Did someone get left behind?","Oooh, you're so cute.","Mmmmm ...","Does that look like the face of a killer to you?","We've got to get the baby out of here!","There's Aang!","Is something wrong?","I don't know.","There's something ominous about that place.","Sokka, you've got an elbow leech.","You couldn't find them?","Maybe you should listen to Aang.","Something about this place feels ...","''alive.''","Appa!","Momo!","What was that?","Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?","Aang!","Sokka!","Hello?","Hello?","Can you help me?","Mom?","Mom!","I can't believe ...

You did it Appa!","Well, you know ...","Thanks.","Zuko, I can help.","I don't understand what went wrong.","He did it exactly the way you did.","I've been training Aang for a while now.","He really responds well to a positive teaching experience.","Lots of encouragement and praise.","Kind words.","If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.","Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?","Heh.","Aang, it's no big deal.","You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready.","Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on.","Okay?","You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?","Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?","That's why it's so difficult for you to get this.","You're working with your natural opposite.","But you'll figure it out.","I know you will.","Think fast!","Excellent.","You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.","It's important.","It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet.","I think we should search for him.","You found him!","You did it!","I knew you would!","You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?","Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time?","All right, we'll finish our vacations and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.","How about the Misty Palms Oasis?","That sounds refreshing.","You've made a lot of trips into the desert.","I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.","It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air.","Forget it.","It's obviously not what we're looking for.","The building in this drawing is enormous.","You got something against libraries?","Oh, right.","Sorry.","I have an authentic waterbending scroll.","Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed?","They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.","Maybe these dials represent dates and times.","Sokka, try entering that date from that parchment you took.","Hey, wait.","What happened to the sun?","That makes sense.","I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders.","This is huge.","He's sinking the building.","We've gotta get out of here.","Sokka, let's go.","Don't be stupid!","We'll find out later!","But ...!","Hurry, Sokka!","Just go!","Aang, stop it.","You know Toph did all she could.","She saved our lives.","We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now.","Aang, wait!","We'd better start walking.","We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse.","We have to get that information to Ba Sing Se.","Come on guys, we've got to stick together.","Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.","I'm sorry, it's all we have.","Sokka, wait!","You shouldn't be eating strange plants!","I don't know ...","Okay, I think you've had enough.","I don't think that's a good idea.","Come on, we need to find Aang.","What is that?","Let's just keep moving.","I hope Aang's okay ...","I'm sorry, Aang.","I know it's hard for you right now but ... we need to focus on getting out of here.","Come on, Aang.","We can do this if we work together.","Right Toph?","Sokka?","Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?","Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together!","Aang, get up.","Everybody, hold hands.","We can do this.","We have to.","I think we should stop for the night.","This is the last of it.","Everyone can have a little drink.","No, he hasn't.","Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library.","Sokka, I was there.","No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is.","We can use the stars to guide us.","That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day.","Just try to get some sleep.","We'll start again in a few hours.","Come on, get up.","We need to go.","Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit.","It's just a cloud.","Wait!","A cloud!","Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.","Wow ... there's hardly any in here.","Trying to keep everyone together.","Let's just get moving.","We need to head this direction.","It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use!","And look!","It's got some kind of compass on it!","I bet it can point us out of here!","Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it.","We're going to make it!","The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts.","That's what the compass is pointing to!","That giant rock!","It must be the magnetic center of the desert.","Maybe we can find some water there!","Sokka, there's nothing there!","We have to get out of here!","I'm completely out of water to bend!","Come on, we're going down.","Toph, shoot a rock right there.","Fire!","Yes.","Now let's move.","On your left!","We found the sailer abandoned in the desert.","We're traveling with the Avatar.","Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se.","Waterbending bomb!","Yeah!","Sorry.","Shush up about Appa.","Can't you at least try to be sensitive?","Oh ... well, okay.","I'm glad you're doing better.","Great!","We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.","Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?","I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.","You look so different without your makeup!","And the new outfit.","Appa is missing.","We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.","It says, \"abandon hope\".","What are you talking about?","Okay, if you say so.","You know, it's okay to miss Appa.","What's going on with you?","In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all.","But now you're not letting yourself feel anything.","I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care.","But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.","Come on, you need a hug.","Everyone single file!","Aang, I need help!","What is that thing?","Sokka!","Sokka, calm down.","I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home.","It's called a baby and I helped her deliver plenty of those, too.","Aang, get some rags.","Sokka, water.","Toph, I need you to make an earth tent, a big one.","Suki, come with me.","You're doing great, Ying.","Sokka, where's that water?","Now get ready to push.","One ... two ... ... three, push!","It's a girl!","Aang, you have to come see this.","She's beautiful.","You'll find him, Aang.","Aang, what are you doing here?","I thought you were looking for Appa.","And also the complaining guy.","His chi is blocked.","Who did this to you?","Ty Lee.","She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points.","It's like she takes you down from the inside.","Yes?","They come to fix it!","Hi.","What's this \"we\" stuff?","Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.","Grrr!","At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall.","This is bad, ''really'' bad.","So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through.","Wait.","You need this water more than I do!","Slurry pipeline?","What does that mean?","Why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak?","You know, I'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day!","You're like a chattering hog-monkey!","Toph, help me plug up this drain.","Enough with the Team Avatar stuff.","No matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on.","Let's talk about this on our way into the city.","Sokka ... Look, the Inner Wall!","I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.","Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa.","What's that wall for?","Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?","What's inside that wall?","Get in trouble with who?!","I got it!","I know how we're going to see the Earth King!","The king is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.","No, it just says 'bear'.","Just ... bear.","The palace will be packed.","We can sneak in with the crowd!","Why not?","Excuse me?","''I've'' got no manners?!","You're not exactly \"lady fancy fingers!\"","We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate.","Sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations.","She's blind.","Do you think you could help us?","Our family's inside and I'm sure they're ''very'' worried.","I'm Kwa Mai, and this is ... Dum.","Ow!","Uh ...","I don't see them right now, but I'm sure we'll find them soon.","Thanks for all your help.","Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in ''won't'' let us out of his sight!","So the king is just a figurehead.","You can't keep the truth from all these people.","They ''have'' to know.","What happened to Joo Dee?","Toph!","Aren't you gonna get ready for the day?","You're not gonna wash up?","You've got a little dirt on your ... everywhere, actually.","Hmm ...

You're really pretty.","Yeah, you are.","Ow!","One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.","Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city.","His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful.","I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.","Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change.","Let's fly!","We have to be careful.","Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming.","Sorry!","Sorry!","We just need to get through to see the Earth King!","You have to trust us.","So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before?","The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!","The wall.","They'll never be able to cover that up in time.","Really?","Then perhaps you could explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your \"construction project\".","It's a letter from your mom.","Your mom's here in the city.","And she wants to see you.","Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?","\"A small fleet of Water Tribe ships.\"","\"Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay.","Led by Hakoda.\"","It ''is'' Dad!","And I can't believe we know where our dad is now.","I hate to say it, but we have to split up.","You have to meet this guru, Aang.","If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.","No, Sokka.","I know how badly you wanna help Dad.","You go to Chameleon Bay.","I'll stay here with the king.","Easy there, big brother ...","Though you're right.","I am.","What is it, Aang?","Wait.","Aang.","Me too.","Or we could send in Momo to do some damage!","'Cause, the ... sorry.","I'll get these scrolls to him right away.","Thank you, General How.","What do you say, Momo?","A cup of tea before we get back to the king?","Table for two, please.","Thank goodness you're here, Suki.","Something terrible is going on.","The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle!","We have to tell the Earth King right away!","Zuko!","Why did they throw you in here?","Oh, wait, let me guess.","It's a trap.","So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches!","You're a terrible person!","You know that?","Always following us!","Hunting the Avatar!","Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace!","But what do you care?","You're the Fire Lord's son.","Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!","I don't?","How dare you!","You have no idea what this war has put me through!","Me personally!","The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.","I'm sorry I yelled at you before.","It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.","No, no, that's-that's not what I mean.","Maybe you could be free of it.","I have healing abilities.","This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole.","It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important.","I don't know if it would work, but ...

Is there anything you need?","I brought you some food!","Oh no ...","He left.","Aang.","He just took his glider and disappeared.","He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility.","It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid!","We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too?","How can he just leave us behind?","How could you leave us, Dad?","I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you.","I understand why you left.","I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way?","I'm so sad and angry and hurt!","You're okay!","I know, but you'll have our help.","Sokka, we don't need to become cave people.","What we need is some new clothes.","I call the silk robe!","How do I look?","Oh, oh, yeah.","I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it?","Where have you been?","We've been worried sick.","Sapphire Fire.","Nice to meet you.","My goodness!","That doesn't sound like our Kuzon.","Eh, if that's what you like ...","I don't know, Aang.","These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to- Okay.","Aang, everyone's watching.","We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache now.","Well, that was some dance party Aang.","It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food, assuming that'll fit into Sokka's ''master'' schedule.","We're um ... from the Earth Kingdom colonies.","Why do you guys live on the river?","Look at this place.","It's so sad.","We ''have'' to do something to help.","These people are starving!","But you'd turn your back on them?","How can you be so cold and heartless?","I guess so.","I wish I could help more.","Forty''-three'' minutes?","No way!","I think Appa's sick.","It looks like he needs some medicine.","Maybe we can find the right herbs in town.","The Painted who now?","Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.","Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit?","Why would you say that?","Look how much better off these people are.","Well, hello Avatar.","I wish I could talk, but I am very busy.","Thank you, but- A lot of people say that.","Look, I really should get going.","Hi, Aang.","I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village.","But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her.","He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine!","I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ... Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do.","Yes.","Sokka was just kidding, but he was right.","Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people

I will never, ''ever'' turn my back on people who need me!","I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can.","I thought you didn't want to help.","Sokka, you really do have a heart.","Leave this village and ''never'' come back.","Sokka, it's okay.","I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you.","But I felt like I had to do something.","It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not.","Because your problems are real, and this river is real.","You can't wait around for someone to help you.","You have to help yourself.","So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?","Wow, this is amazing to watch.","The fire is gonna destroy that town!","There's a creek over here.","I'll bend the water onto the fire.","What's your problem?","You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.","That's not true.","No one can read a map like you.","What?","What's wrong with my hair?","I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know, none of us

there's such a thing as \"space earth\".","If it's from space, then it's not really \"earth\".","I can't believe I missed you.","There are walls all around us.","It's completely safe.","I don't think so.","I get the feeling he knows who we are.","But, there's nothing here.","Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World?","Oh, Sokka, just hold hands.","You brought this on yourself.","I had no choice.","Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph!","Oh, sorry.","Did I splash you, Mud-Slug?","I'll give you a mud pie!","Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?","Ah, so she cheated.","I'm just saying this isn't something we should make a habit of doing.","I don't hate fun!","See?","Fun!","Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough.","If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen.","Oh, I'm sorry!","You think I should be more like you?","Like some wild child?","Ah.","I see.","You're acting like this because of your parents.","They were controlling over you,

wanna deal with that, so instead you act like this crazy person.","You know what?","It doesn't matter.","These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that.","We've already got some third-eyed freak after us.","We have enough money!","You need to stop this!","Well.","Look who decided to join us.","Where have you two been?","Off scamming again?","And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?","Really?","Well then.","What's this?","It's a wanted poster of you!","\"The Runaway!\"","Is that what you're called now?","Are you proud of this?","It doesn't matter where I got it.","The fact is- Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it!","Fine!","It's a lie!","But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up!","I knew you were hiding something and you were!","Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!","I wish I could!","I never said I was!","I don't act that way!","Sokka, do I act motherly?","What do you think, Aang?","Do I act like a mom?","Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!","Well, I can't be around you!","I know this is from you, Sokka!","Toph can't write!","Ugh!","You're all driving me crazy!","Hi, Toph.","Um, I wanna- Actually I wasn't going to apologize.","I was gonna say ...","I wanna pull a scam with you.","Not just any scam.","The ''ultimate'' scam.","Whaddaya say, Toph?","Just me and you.","One last go.","You in?","You brought this on yourself.","I had no choice.","The right thing is its own reward.","But, I still want the actual reward.","Really?","No kidding!","Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now?","Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?","I can't believe I'm so stupid!","See?","This is exactly why I'm against these scams!","I knew this would happen!","I know.","I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly.","I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.","I know your relationship with your parents is complicated.","And I shouldn't have said what I said.","What are we gonna do?","What about your meteor bracelet?","You can make a saw.","Just fine.","I'm making my own water.","Aang, get up!","What is it, Toph?","I'll be happy to help.","You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole.","This ship has haunted my tribe when Gran-Gran was a little girl.","It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.","I always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.","I'm making my own water!","No, wait!","I've got one!","And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.","No, it happened to Mom.","One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks.","A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm.","So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family.","When they got there, no one was home.","Just a fire flickering in the fireplace.","While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house.","When she was alone, she heard a voice.","\"It's so cold and I can't get warm!\"","Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire.","She was blue like she was frozen.","Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.","No one knows.","Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.","You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ...","Thanks for letting us stay here tonight.","You have a lovely inn.","That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you.","Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages?","That's ridiculous.","She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay.","She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.","Gee, I don't know.","Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night?","Isn't that a little mysterious?","Sokka!","Sokka, what are you doing?","You can't just snoop around someone's house.","Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!","Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!","Sokka, what are you doing?","You're breaking into a private room!","This is crazy!","I'm leaving!","You're from the Southern Water Tribe?","How did you know?","I knew I felt a bond with you right away.","You're a waterbender!","I've never met another waterbender from our tribe!","We completely understand.","We lost our mother in a raid.","I can't tell you what it means to meet you.","It's an honor.","You're a hero.","Yes!","Yes, of course!","To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.","I know!","When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do.","I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.","Wow, these flowers are beautiful.","I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside.","That was incredible!","It's a shame about the lilies, though.","But isn't that dangerous?","I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.","But ... to reach inside someone and control them?","I don't know if I want that kind of power.","I know.","It's you ... You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!","I won't!","I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town!","Stop!","Please ... You're not the only one who draws power from the moon!","My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama.","Your technique is useless on me!","I'm sorry, Aang!","No!","Nice choice, Sokka.","And we're here four days ahead of schedule.","Sokka's got the right idea, Aang.","We're here.","We're ready.","The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest.","Hey.","How long have you been up?","You know, there is such a thing as over-training.","Aang, it's the middle of the night.","You need to go back to sleep.","Aang, sleep.","Please.","For me.","Aang!","I know you're just trying to help, but you ''really'' need to get a grip.","You're unraveling.","Sokka!","You're not helping!","You know what, I've got just the thing!","Get ready to be de-stressified!","These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat.","Reach ''up''.","Reach for the sun.","Feel your chi paths clearing.","Now close your eyes.","How are you feeling?","Good, good.","Go on.","Maybe your stress is the kind you need to ''talk'' out.","So, do you feel less stressed?","Ready for a good night's sleep?","What happened, Aang?","You don't look so good.","You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?","Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you.","What big things?","Aang, what are you saying?","What are we doing?","Aang!","I was just saying you should take a nap.","What was your dream about?","Sounds neat!","Aang?","We're all starting to get a little worried about you.","Aang ...","I'm ''not'' going to hit you.","Listen to me.","You've been training for this since the day we met.","I've seen your progress.","You're smart, brave, and strong enough.","Sounds like you slept well.","You made it, Dad!","Haru!","It's so good to see you!","Wow, when he says the beginning he means the ''beginning'' beginning.","I don't see any gates.","Aang, I ... We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much.","You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore.","I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you.","Yes, it is.","Aang, don't say that, of course you'll- What?","Right, I'm on it.","Dad?","How does that feel, dad?","You're hurt, badly.","You can't fight anymore.","I'm doing everything I can.","No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.","Don't be crazy Sokka.","I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too.","Yeah.","Is that ... is that ''Aang''?","We can wait here if you want.","It's not over yet.","They're back!","Appa, you and I can help too.","We can't keep them all back!","There's too many of them!","Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?","What?","We can't leave you behind!","We won't leave anyone behind!","We'll miss you, Dad.","This is humiliating.","Both.","Uhhh ...","I think your feet need their eyes checked.","You guys go.","I think we need to talk about some things.","We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this.","Aang, no one said it's going to be easy.","We could look for Jeong Jeong!","Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?","You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you?","I mean, how stupid do you think we are?!","Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us?","You need to get out of here.","Now.","No, we won't!","Get out of here, and don't come back!","And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again!","Why would he try to fool us like that?","This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se.","He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.","The thing is, it worked.","I did feel sorry for him.","I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price.","We can't trust him.","Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!","No way!","I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!","And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free?","What a liar!","You're right, Toph!","Let's go find him and give him a medal.","The \"not as much of a jerk as you could have been\" award!","Easy for you to say!","You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates!","Why would you even try to defend him?","Well, I guess that settles that.","Has anyone seen Toph?","I think we should go look for her.","Toph!","What happened?","Oh no, what happened?","I meant, how.","Zuko?","It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better.","I wish I could have worked on them sooner.","You are a master of surprise, Sokka ...","I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.","I'm sorry.","I'm just laughing at the irony.","You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.","Maybe you're not as good as you think you are.","That's ridiculous.","Sure.","Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.","\"Need meat.","Gone fishing.","Back in a few days.","Sokka and Zuko.\"","One more thing.","\"Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone.","Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak.","Zuko.\"","What are you doing in this thing?","What happened to the war balloon?","How are you here?","What is going on?","Where did you go?","What are you doing?","Okay, I'm not crushed.","You can get off me now!","Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here.","No!","The Fire Nation can't separate our family again!","Ha, ha.","Yeah, no kidding.","You really want to know?","Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.","Or, I know!","You could bring my mother back!","You look terrible.","What do you want?","I need to borrow Appa.","Yes, it is.","We're going to find the man who took my mother from me.","Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand.","Fine, maybe it is!","Maybe that's what I need!","Maybe that's what he deserves!","It's not the same!","Jet attacked the innocent.","This man, he's a monster.","Then you didn't love her the way I did!","Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice.","It's not just hard, it's impossible.","Yes.","Don't try to stop us.","Whaletail Island, here we come.","Oh, don't you worry about my strength.","I have plenty.","I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came.","I ran as fast as I could.","But we were too late.","When we got there, the man was gone.","And so was she.","I know.","Let's do this.","It's not him.","He's not the man.","That was him.","That was the monster.","Do you know who I am?","Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it!","Why don't you take a closer look?","She lied to you!","She was protecting the last waterbender!","Me!","I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand.","There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all.","You're pathetic and sad and empty.","But as much as I hate you ...","I just can't do it.","I'm doing fine.","I wanted to do it.","I wanted to take out all my anger at him, but I couldn't.","I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or because I'm strong enough not to.","But I didn't forgive him.","I'll never forgive him.","But I am ready to forgive you.","Doesn't it seem kind of weird that we're hiding from the Fire Lord in his own house?","What?","How is that possible?","Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?","Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.","Well, that's just silly.","I don't sound like that.","Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on.","Relax, Aang.","They're not accurate portrayals.","It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time.","What?","Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth.","It hurts, doesn't it?","You didn't really say that, did you?","Does anyone know where Aang is?","I'm gonna check outside.","Are you all right?","I know it's upsetting, but it sounds like you're overreacting.","In where?","What are you talking about?","I didn't say that.","An actor said that.","Aang, I don't know.","Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about.","This isn't the right time.","Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused.","I just said I was confused!","I'm going inside.","No kidding.","Who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice?","What happened?","What's wrong with you?","You could have hurt Aang!","The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the Comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the War, but they pretty much won the War when they took Ba Sing Se.","Things can't get any worse.","I can't believe this.","Aang, you don't have to do this alone.","Get over here, Zuko.","Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.","Actually, I used it all up after Azula shot you.","I have a surprise for everyone!","Uh, no.","I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this!","Look at baby Zuko.","Isn't he cute?","Oh, lighten up.","I'm just teasing.","Aang, we do understand.","It's just ... We're trying to help!","Aang, don't walk away from this.","Maybe he was captured.","Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island.","Let's split up and look for him.","Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo.","He's probably with Aang.","What should we do Zuko?","Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.","And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?","I'm not his girlfriend!","I have Aang's staff.","Not just any old people.","These are great masters and friends of ours.","Pakku.","That's so exciting!","You and Gran-Gran must be so happy to have found each other again!","And this was Aang's first firebending teacher.","Are you okay?","Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?","Then he'll forgive you.","He will.","It would be my pleasure.","Goodbye, General Iroh.","Zuko, don't worry.","We can take Azula.","Aang won't lose.","He's gonna come back.","He has to.","And you're going down.","What are you doing?","She's playing you.","She knows she can't take us both, so she's trying to separate us.","But even ''you'' admitted to your uncle that you would need help facing Azula.","Zuko!","I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.","That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka.","Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears?"]},"Zuko":{"combined_dialog":["Finally!","Uncle, do you realize what this means?!","It means my search is about to come to an end.","That light came from an ''incredibly'' powerful source!","It has to be him!","I don't need any calming tea!","I need to capture the Avatar!","Helmsman, head a course for the light!","Because their ''honor'' didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture.","Mine ''does.''","This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.","Enough!","I've been drilling this sequence all day.","Teach me the next set!","I'm ''more'' than ready!","The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.","He must be over a hundred years old by now.","He's had a century to master the four elements!","I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.","You ''will'' teach me the advanced set!","The last airbender!","Quite agile for his old age.","Wake my uncle!","Tell him I found the Avatar.","As ''well'' as his hiding place ... Where are you hiding him?","I ''know'' you're hiding him!","''You're'' the airbender?","''You're'' the Avatar?","I've spent years preparing for this encounter.","Training, meditating.","You're just a child!","Head a course for the Fire Nation.","I'm going home.","This staff will make an excellent gift for my father.","I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks.","Take the Avatar to the prison hold, and take this to my quarters.","Looks like I underestimated you.","What is that?","Shoot them down!","That \"kid\", Uncle, just did ''this.''","I won't underestimate him again.","Dig the ship out and follow them!","As soon as you're done with that.","Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible.","I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.","Don't mention his name on these docks!","Once word gets out that he's alive, every firebender will be out looking for him, and I don't want anyone getting in the way!","Captain Zhao.","Yes.","You wouldn't believe what happened.","Uncle!","Tell Commander Zhao what happened.","Yes!","Right into ... an Earth Kingdom ship!","Sorry, but we have to go.","If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool!","We haven't found him yet.","No.","Nothing.","I haven't found anything.","It's like you said.","The Avatar probably died a long time ago.","Come on, Uncle, we're going.","I underestimated him ''once'', but it will ''not'' happen again!","Commander Zhao, I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I - Why?","Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?","Don't underestimate me, Zhao!","I will capture the Avatar before you!","You're wrong!","Once I deliver the Avatar to my father, he will welcome me home with honor, and restore my rightful place on the throne!","That's not true.","Maybe you'd like one to match!","An Agni Kai.","At sunset.","I will never forget.","I refuse to let him win.","Next time you get in my way, I promise, I won't hold back.","Did you really mean that, Uncle?","The only reason you should be interrupting me, is if you have news about the Avatar.","Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader.","Now, whatever you have to say, I'm sure I can take it.","What!?","Give me the map!","The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?","Uncle, ready the rhinos.","He's not getting away from me this time.","I was going to save it for later!","I want the Avatar ''alive.''","Come out, Avatar!","You can't hide from me forever!","Find him.","Nice try, Avatar!","But these little girls can't save you.","Finally!","Back to the ship!","Don't lose sight of them!","Uncle!","It's time to leave!","Where are you?","Uncle Iroh!","Uncle?","We need to move on.","We're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him.","My troubles cannot be soaked away.","It's time to go!","Enough!","We need to leave now.","Get out of the water!","On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes?","But be back at the ship in a half-hour or I'm leaving without you!","Uncle!","Uncle, where are you?","Something's not right here.","That pile of rocks.","Land doesn't slide uphill.","Those rocks didn't move naturally.","My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!","Yeah, that's Uncle Iroh.","The Avatar!","You taught me well.","Now would you please put on some clothes?","Having trouble sleeping?","Seen the Avatar lately?","I have no choice, Uncle.","I'm chasing the Avatar!","My father will understand why I am returning home!","There they are.","Helmsman!","Full steam ahead!","On my mark!","Fire!","A blockade.","He's not turning around!","I'm sorry, Uncle.","Run the blockade!","Do ''not'' stop this ship.","We can make it!","What's he up to, Uncle?","Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?","If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.","Uncle, keep heading north.","Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover.","The Avatar's coming with me!","Close the doors!","Quickly!","Why isn't it working?","It's sealed shut!","Why did you help the Avatar?","You're too late, Zhao!","The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.","What is the meaning of this mutiny?","No one told you to change course!","Is it something to do with the Avatar?","Lotus tile?","You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?","It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time ''for everyone''!","You bought a tsungi horn?","This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?","We don't need to stop.","They stole a waterbending scroll, right?","Then they'll be on the water.","I'll save you from the pirates.","Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.","Try to understand.","I need to capture him to restore something I've lost, my honor.","Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost.","I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering.","''Tell me'' where he is.","I wonder how much this is worth ...

Ahh!","We're not taking any more chances with these plants!","We need to get help.","If the Earth Kingdom discovers us, they'll have us killed.","Earth Kingdom it is.","Names?","Of course we have names.","I'm, uh ... Lee and this is my Uncle, uh ...

Aaaah!","Ugggh!","Get away from us!","Leave!","Uncle ... you were unconscious.","Azula did this to you.","It was a surprise attack.","I hope I made it the way you like it.","So Uncle, I've been thinking.","It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again.","I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her.","I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her.","I see.","That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind.","I'm ready to try it!","Why can't I do it?","Instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face ... like everything always does.","What turmoil?","But I don't feel any shame at all.","I'm as proud as ever.","Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately.","Why are you telling me these things?","All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.","You can teach me to redirect lightning?","I think so.","Great, I'm ready to try it with real lightning!","I thought that was the point!","You teaching me to protect myself from it!","Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning.","You've always thrown everything you could at me!","Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back!","Come on, strike me!","You've never held back before!","Maybe we should make camp.","You know these guys?","Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you.","No one here is going to help us.","These people just look like filthy wanderers.","You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?","What are you old gasbags talking about?","I thought you said he would help!","Look around.","We're not tourists, we're refugees.","Ugh!","I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt.","I'm tired of living like this!","Hello.","I'm in.","I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path.","I'm going to forget I saw that.","Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.","I said no.","What are you doing firebending your tea?","For a wise, old man, that was a pretty stupid move!","This city is a prison.","I don't want to make a life here.","Ridiculous.","Uncle, that's what ''all'' tea is.","We've been working in a tea shop all day!","I'm ''sick'' of tea!","You want a show?","I'll give you a show!","''You're'' the one who needs help.","Uncle, we have a problem.","One of the customers is on to us.","Don't look now but there is a girl over there at the corner table.","She knows we're Fire Nation.","Didn't I say don't look?!","What?","My name's Lee.","My uncle and I just moved here.","It took my uncle ten minutes to do my hair.","It's okay.","Nothing.","She is not my girlfriend!","You have ... quite an appetite for a girl.","Umm ... well, we've been traveling around for a long time.","We were ... uh, part of this traveling circus.","Yes, I juggled.","I haven't practiced for a while.","Close your eyes, and don't peek.","Okay, now you can look.","I've brought you something.","It's a coupon for a free cup of tea.","It's complicated.","I have to go.","It was nice.","Uncle?","What are you looking at?","Is there something out there?","I don't feel right.","So thirsty.","I'm not tired.","What's happening?","What's that mean?","What's that smell?","Actually, it smells delicious.","I'd love a bowl, Uncle.","It's a new day.","We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop.","Things are looking up, Uncle.","Congratulations, Uncle.","You deserve it.","The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.","Now let's make these people some tea!","Uncle!","I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee!","What is it, Uncle?","It sure is, Uncle.","What's taking so long?","Something's not right.","Azula!","No!","I'm tired of running!","It's time I faced Azula!","Yes!","I challenge you!","You don't know what you're talking about!","I'm sorry.","That's something we have in common.","It doesn't matter.","My face?","I see.","It's okay.","I used to think this scar marked me.","The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever.","But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.","What?","It's a scar, it can't be healed.","Uncle, I don't understand.","What are you doing with the Avatar?","Why, Uncle?","Release him immediately.","I have changed.","I betrayed Uncle.","But I don't have the Avatar.","What if Father doesn't restore my honor?","I've got a lot on my mind.","It's been so long, over three years since I was home.","I wonder what's changed.","I wonder how ''I've'' changed.","I haven't seen Dad yet.","I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished.","So, I didn't capture the Avatar.","No.","There's no way he could have survived.","What did you hear?","Why'd you do it?","Why did you tell Father that I was the one who killed the Avatar?","It.","Can't.","But why?","You're lying.","You have another motive for doing this, I just haven't figured out what it is.","I'm going in for a visit.","You're going to stand guard here, and ''no one'' is going to know about this.","Uncle, it's me.","You brought this on yourself you know.","We could have returned together.","You could have been a hero!","You have no right to judge me, Uncle.","I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me.","You're not going to say anything?","You're a crazy old man!","You're crazy!","And if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter!","You're so beautiful when you hate the world.","I don't hate you too.","Can't you see we're busy?","That guard told you.","Okay, you caught me.","What is it that you want, Azula?","I brought you some komodo chicken.","I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food.","I admit it, I have everything I always wanted, but it's not as all how I thought it would be.","The truth is, I need your advice.","I think the Avatar is still alive, I ''know'' he's out there, I'm losing my mind.","Please, Uncle, I'm so confused I need your help.","Forget it, I'll solve it myself!","Waste away in here for all I care!","You're sure you weren't followed?","I've heard about you.","They say you're good at what you do, and even better at keeping secrets.","The Avatar is alive.","I want you to find him, and end him.","Doing nothing is a waste of time.","We're being sent away on a forced vacation.","I feel like a child.","That was a long time ago.","It smells like old lady in here.","Here.","This is for you.","I saw it, and I thought it was pretty.","Don't girls like stuff like this?","Forget it!","I thought, since it's so hot ... here.","Why didn't you tell those guys who we were?","He thinks he's so great.","Well, what do you think of him?","You like him, don't you?","I know.","So what?","Sure.","Hey, watch it!","That food was for my cranky girlfriend!","Stop talking to my girlfriend!","What's wrong with ''me''?","Well, at least I feel something, as opposed to you.","You have no passion for anything!","You're just a big blah!","I was just leaving.","Those summers we spent here seem so long ago.","So much has changed.","Where's your new boyfriend?","Are you cold?","What does it look like I'm doing?","You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business?","No, you don't.","You're stuck in your little \"Ty Lee world\" where everything's great all the time.","\"I'm so pretty.","Look at me.","I can walk on my hands.","Whoo!\"","Circus freak.","Yeah, you do not believe in anything.","I'm sorry, too.","I wish you ''would'' be high-strung and crazy for once instead of keeping all your feeling bottled up inside.","She just called your aura dingy.","Are you gonna take that?","I like it when you express yourself.","My life hasn't been that easy either, Mai.","Bad skin?","''Normal'' teenagers worry about bad skin.","I don't have that luxury.","My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my ''face''!","For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy.","I'm back home now, my dad talks to me.","Ha!","He even thinks I'm a hero.","Everything should be perfect, right?","I should be happy now, but I'm not.","I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!","No one.","I'm just angry.","Everyone.","I don't know.","No, no.","No, no, n-no, no!","Because I'm confused.","Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.","I guess you wouldn't understand, would you, Azula?","Because you're just ''so'' perfect.","Party's over.","You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise.","It will reveal your own destiny.","Wait, I need to ask you something.","What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history?","But how did he die?","What does it mean?","The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the Dragonbone Catacombs.","The final testimony of Fire Lord Sozin.","That can't be it!","Where's the rest of it?","You sent this, didn't you?","I found the secret history, which by the way should be renamed history most people already know!","The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end.","What are you talking about?","Why are you telling me this?","I'm just going to Mai's house.","It's not far.","Tell me, if you could have anything you want right now, what would it be?","You know, being a prince and all, I ''might'' just be able to make that happen.","Do you think you could find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top?","War meeting?","What are you talking about?","I guess I wasn't invited.","So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh?","And apparently I'm not welcome there.","Oh, yeah?!","I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it!","Well, were you invited?","And I'm the prince!","Forget it!","I'm not going!","I don't.","I know.","What?","So, my dad ''wants'' me at the meeting?","When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me.","My father had saved me a seat.","He wanted me next to him.","I was ''literally'' at his right hand.","During the meeting, I was the perfect prince.","The son my father wanted.","But I wasn't me.","I'm sorry Mai.","I know I've made some bad choices, but today, I'm gonna set things right.","I'm ready to face you.","I'm here to tell the truth.","First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.","Because the Avatar's not dead.","He survived.","In fact, he's probably leading this invasion.","He could be on his way here right now.","That's another thing.","I'm not taking orders from you anymore.","Think again.","I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen.","For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me.","I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you.","You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.","My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai.","How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?","It was cruel!","And it was wrong.","No, I've learned everything!","And I've had to learn it on my own!","Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history.","And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world.","What an amazing lie that was.","The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation.","They don't see our greatness.","They hate us!","And we deserve it!","We've created an era of fear in the world.","And if we don't want the world to destroy itself , we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.","Yes.","He has.","After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness.","He's the one who's been a real father to me.","But I've come to an even more important decision.","I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.","Because I know my own destiny.","Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.","Goodbye.","What happened that night?","So she's alive?","The only view I'm interested in seeing is the Avatar in chains.","First we'll check each of the air temples, then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him.","What else would I expect to hear from the ''laziest'' man in the Fire Nation?","The only way to regain my honor is to find the Avatar, so I will.","Hello ... Zuko here, but I guess you probably already know me, sort of.","Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm considered to be pretty good at it.","Well, you've seen me, you know, when I was attacking you.","Uhhh ... yeah, I guess I should apologize for that.","But anyway, I'm good now.","I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad, but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught the Avatar firebending.","Well, what's your answer?","Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too.","How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side?","What would Uncle do?","Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self.","Only then will your true self, reveal itself.","Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means.","What would Azula do?","Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends.","Your choice.","I guess I'm just not that good at impersonations.","Hello ... Zuko here.","Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so, I just thought I'd wait for you here.","I know you must be surprised to see me here.","Right.","Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I can teach firebending to you.","See, I, uhhh ...","I've done some good things!","I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free.","That's something!","I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes in the past.","Look, I admit I've some awful things.","I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe.","And I never should have sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.","I'm going to try and stop- Well, that's not his name, but- He's not my friend!","Why aren't you saying anything?","You once said you thought we could be friends.","You know I have good in me.","I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore!","If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.","Uggh!","I can't believe how stupid I am!","I mean, what was I thinking?","Telling them I sent an assassin after them?","Why didn't I just say Azula did that?","They would have believed that!","Stupid!","Uggh!","Who's there?","Stay back!","I'm sorry, it was a mistake!","Let me help you!","I'm sorry!","I didn't know it was you!","Uggh, come back!","Uggh!","Why am I so bad at being good?","Stop!","I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore!","The mission is off.","I'm ordering you to stop.","If you keep attacking, I won't pay you!","All right, I'll pay you double to stop!","Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard.","But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth.","I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me.","But I know now that no one can give you your honor.","It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right.","All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world.","I'm sorry for what I did to you.","It was an accident.","Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.","Thank you.","I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.","I won't let you down!","I promise!","If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar.","I know it's my destiny to capture him.","I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is ''not'' something to fear.","But if you don't respect it, it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!","Now show me what you've got.","Any amount of fire you can make.","Good idea.","You might wanna take a couple steps back.","What was that?","That was the worst firebending I've ever seen!","Why is this happening?","Yeah, could be.","Just breathe, and ... Don't patronize me!","You know what it's supposed to look like!","And stop calling me that!","Get out of here!","Listen everybody, I've got some pretty bad news.","I've lost my stuff.","I'm talking about my firebending.","It's gone.","Well, it's not lost.","It's just ... weaker for some reason.","I bet it's because I changed sides.","Okay, cut it out!","Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore.","There has to be another way.","Well, this doesn't help me.","The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct.","Well, they aren't around anymore, okay?","But maybe there's another way.","The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors.","No, they died off thousands of years ago.","But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now.","Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins.","More or less.","Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher.","We've been riding for hours.","I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster.","I can't believe this.","Even though these buildings are ancient, there's something eerily familiar about them.","I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these.","I can't believe it.","This booby trap must be centuries old and it still works.","Where's that up-beat attitude you were talkin' about?","Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting.","They look pretty angry to me.","Well, they had a funny way of showing it.","My great-grandfather Sozin happened.","He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory.","There were the ultimate firebenders.","And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents would become legendary and you'd earn the honorary title, Dragon.","The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born, by my uncle.","He had a complicated past.","Family tradition, I guess.","Let's just move on.","Wait.","It's a celestial calendar.","Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples.","I bet that sunstone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle.","On the solstice.","No, we can't.","But we might be able to speed time up.","Let's see if we can outsmart the sunstone.","Come on ...","Relax.","They're just statues.","What?","This better teach us some really good firebending.","It's some kind of mystical gemstone.","Why not?","It feels almost alive.","Ugh, I can't pull free.","It's like some kind of glue.","Me?","I can't move either!","At least we have air.","Maybe if we stay calm, we can figure a way out of this.","At least I made something happen.","If it were up to you, we'd never have made it past the courtyard.","Who are you yelling to?","Nobody's lived here for centuries.","We didn't come here to take your sunstone.","We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.","My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.","O-or at least I used to be.","I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage.","But now I want to learn the true way, the original way.","When we came here, I never imagined the Sun Warrior's civilization was secretly alive.","I am truly humbled to be in your presence.","Please, teach us.","I don't believe it.","Hurry up.","Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small.","You're too timid, give it more juice.","You can do it.","I know you can.","You're a talented kid.","No, we're seeing this through to the end.","We're gonna meet these masters and find out what's so great about them.","Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar.","I think we could take these guys in a fight, whoever they are.","Bring 'em out!","No, just make your own.","These are the masters.","Sshh.","I never said that.","Fine.","I understand.","Their fire was beautiful.","I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.","I can't believe there are still living dragons.","My uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it.","He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them.","Yeah.","It's like the Sun, but inside of you.","Do you guys realize this?","That's why my firebending was so weak before.","Because for so many years, hunting you was my drive ... it was my purpose.","So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire.","But now, I have a new drive.","I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world.","It's not a dance.","It's a firebending form.","It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!","The Dancing Dragon.","No one can make tea like Uncle , but hopefully I learned a thing or two.","Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?","Okay.","Well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punch line is \"Leaf me alone, I'm bushed!\"","Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.","So, what's up?","What do you mean?","Who was captured?","I can't tell you.","Trust me.","Knowing would just make you feel worse.","It's not good, Sokka.","My guess is, they were taken to the Boiling Rock.","The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.","It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.","It's inescapable.","Why do you need to know?","What are you planning?","It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation.","You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.","Yeah, I'm sure it does.","Not up to anything, huh?","I'm never happy.","You need to regain your honor?","Believe me, I get it.","I'm going with you.","How are you going to get there?","On Appa?","Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares.","We'll take my war balloon.","Yeah ... fluffy.","What?","No kidding.","If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war.","Hey, hold on.","Not everyone in my family is like that.","I meant my uncle.","He was more of a father to me.","And I really let him down.","It wasn't that hard.","Well, I did have a girlfriend.","Mai.","Yeah.","Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor.","I couldn't drag her into it.","That's rough, buddy.","There it is!","There's plenty of steam to keep us covered.","As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.","We're going down!","The balloon's not working anymore!","So what are we supposed to do?","How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?","You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?","Uncle always said I never thought things through.","But this ... this is just crazy!","What are you doing?","I hope you know what you're doing.","There's no turning back now.","I hope these disguises work.","Uh, very cute, sir.","But what if there's an incident?","If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head.","Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?","No, that's not it.","The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right?","So what about war prisoners?","Hey there, fellow guard, how goes it?","Shhh!","Listen, I asked around the lounge.","There are no Water Tribe prisoners.","I'm afraid your father's not here.","Yeah, I'm sure.","I'm really sorry, Sokka.","That's the spirit!","I can't believe that worked.","I didn't even know what I was saying.","How did you know who I am?","You're Mai's uncle?","I never meant to hurt her.","So what's in it for you?","Why don't you just tell my father to come collect a reward?","We did?","Oh, sorry about that.","Nice to see you again.","Yeah ...","The cooler as a boat?","Are you sure?","Yeah, you heard wrong.","There's nothing to get in on.","Hey, you watch who you're shoving!","Yes, I have ... completely.","Someone's coming!","War prisoners.","It could be your father.","Well, what should we do?","Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?","It's your call, Sokka.","Are you sure you wanna go?","You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself.","Redeem your honor.","Rescuing your dad is your chance.","No, it's not.","Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.","Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ... You have to try every time.","You can't quit because you're afraid you ''might'' fail.","I'm staying, too.","Is that him?","I'm here.","What are you doing?","Where are you taking me?","I didn't do anything wrong!","Mai!","How did you know I was here?","But, how- I didn't mean to - Stop!","This isn't about you.","This is about the Fire Nation!","Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.","But I have to do this to save my country.","That's not how I see it.","And how do we do that?","I thought you thought this through!","Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important!","Back off!","We've got the warden!","Let's go!","I'm making it so they can't stop us.","That's a problem.","It's my sister and her friend.","Me too.","They're cutting the line!","The gondola's about to go!","It's Mai!","My sister was on that island.","What I mean is she must have come here somehow.","There!","That's our way out of here!","It kind of got destroyed.","Watch out!","Keeping rocks from crushing you.","I'll take that as a thank you.","Go ahead!","I'll hold them off.","I think this is a family visit.","What are you doing here?","She's ... not gonna make it ... Of course she did.","If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you.","I'm touched.","I don't deserve this.","I wish I knew.","This isn't fair!","Everyone else seems to trust me now!","What is it with you?","What can I do to make it up to you?","Sorry, do you need to talk to Sokka, too?","Your sister.","She hates me!","And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me.","Stop.","Okay, listen.","I know this may seem out of nowhere, but I want you to tell me what happened to your mother.","Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se, and again just now when she was yelling at me.","I think somehow she's connected her anger at that to her anger at me.","Wait.","Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village?","Like what the lead ship looked like?","The symbol of the Southern Raiders.","Thanks, Sokka.","I waited out here all night.","I know who killed your mother, and I'm going to help you find him.","Sokka told me the story of what happened.","I know who did it and I know how to find him.","She needs this, Aang.","This is about getting closure and justice.","That's cute, but this isn't air temple preschool.","It's the real world.","That's the same as doing nothing!","Okay, we'll be sure to do that, guru goody-goody.","We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower.","All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk.","And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed.","Not exactly.","We need to be stealthy and make sure no one spots us, otherwise they'll warn the Southern Raiders long before we reach them.","You should get some rest.","We'll be there in a few hours.","You'll need all your strength.","Your mother was a brave woman.","There!","See those sea raven flags?","It's the Southern Raiders.","This is it, Katara.","Are you ready to face him?","You don't remember her?","You will soon, trust me.","Think back.","Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe.","Don't lie!","You look her in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did.","What?","What do you mean he's not?","He's the leader of the Southern Raiders!","He has to be the guy!","If you're not the man we're looking for, who is?","We weren't behind the bush.","And I wouldn't try firebending again!","You were right about what Katara needed.","Violence wasn't the answer.","Then I have a question for you.","What are you gonna do when you face my father?","I told you, my father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy.","And that was a long time ago.","It's the last place anyone would think to look for us.","Ugh!","My mother used to take us to see them.","They butchered ''Love Amongst the Dragons'' every year!","Just sit next to me.","What's the big deal?","They make me look totally stiff and humorless.","So far, this intermission is the best part of the play.","Did Jet just ... die?","I might as well have.","You don't get it, it's different for you.","You get a muscly version of yourself, taking down ten bad guys at once, and making sassy remarks.","But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life, and shoves them back in my face.","My uncle, he's always been on my side, even when things were bad.","He was there for me, he taught me so much, and how do I repay him?","With a knife in his back.","It's my greatest regret, and I may never get to redeem myself.","How do you know?","Really?","Oh, sorry.","Ow!","What was that for?","The scar's not on the wrong side!","That ... wasn't a good play.","More ferocious!","Imagine striking through your opponent's heart!","Hey!","Your lesson's not over yet!","Get back here!","Fine!","If you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day, then go ahead!","Teaching you a lesson!","Go ahead and do it!","What's wrong with ''me''?","What's wrong with all of you?","How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet is only three days away?","Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?","After?","So, you all knew Aang was going to wait?","You're wrong.","It's about to get worse than you can even imagine.","The day before the eclipse, my father asked me to attend an important war meeting.","It was what I dreamed about for so many years.","My father had finally accepted me back.","The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong.","They can endure anything, as long as they have hope.","Well, that's not exactly what I- I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan, but I'm ashamed to say I didn't.","My whole life, I struggled to gain my father's love and acceptance, but once I had it, I realized I'd lost myself getting there.","I'd forgotten who I was.","I know you're scared, and I know you're not ready to save the world, but if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes, there won't be a world to save anymore.","I didn't think I had to.","I assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet.","No one told ''me'' you decided to wait.","There's one technique you need to know before facing my father - how to redirect lightning.","If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it.","You turn your opponents' energy against them.","Exactly.","My uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.","Once, against my father.","Exhilarating ... but terrifying.","You feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body, but you know if you make the wrong move, it's over.","You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life before he takes yours.","What are you waiting for?","Take him out!","That's not me.","It's my father.","Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers.","You're going to defend him?","Like what?","Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again.","No!","Let him go.","He needs time to sort it out by himself.","Aang?","Aang!","Aang's not in the house.","Let's check the beach.","But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?","Uh-huh.","Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang.","No.","It's like he just ... disappeared.","Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka.","We have a real problem here.","Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away.","I don't know.","Why are you all looking at ''me''?","Just trust me.","June.","The shirshu.","It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world.","It's the one shot we have of finding him.","Yup.","Back in the good old days.","He's my uncle.","And he's not here.","She's not my girlfriend!","I need your help finding the Avatar.","Well, what does that mean?","Wait.","I have another idea.","There's only one other person in this world who can help us face the Fire Lord.","I'll be right back with a smell sample.","Hey!","Wait up!","We're going to Ba Sing Se?","It's been a long day.","Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.","The Order of the White Lotus.","Nah.","Where ... where is he?","No, I'm not okay.","My uncle hates me, I know it.","He loved and supported me in every way he could, and I still turned against him.","How can I even face him?","More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life.","Uncle?","Uncle, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me.","But I want you to know, I am so, so, sorry, Uncle.","I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did.","I don't know how I can ever make it up to you.","But I'll- How can you forgive me so easily?","I thought you would be furious with me.","I did lose my way.","It wasn't that hard, Uncle.","You have a pretty strong scent.","Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.","That's what I just said!","We need you to come with us!","You can beat him!","And we'll be there to help.","And then ... then you would come and take your rightful place on the throne?","Unquestionable honor?","But I've made so many mistakes.","I'll try, Uncle.","I can handle Azula.","You're right.","Katara, how would you like to help me put Azula in her place?","So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?","It's not her I'm worried about.","I'm worried about Aang.","What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my father?","What if he loses?","Sorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today.","''I'' am.","You're on.","I know.","But I can take her this time.","No you're not.","No lightning today?","What's the matter?","Afraid I'll redirect it?","No!","Thank you, Katara.","Mai!","You're okay!","They let you out of prison?","So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?","I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down.","And now ... Yeah, we ''are ''friends.","And it's gonna be even more different... when we build it together.","Please.","The real hero is the Avatar.","Today this war is finally over!","I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation.","And I will.","The road ahead of us is challenging.","A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided.","But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the right path and begin a new era of love and peace.","You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life.","Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life.","It put me on the right path.","Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you.","At least you don't look like a boar-q-pine!","My hair is not that spiky!"]},"Iroh":{"combined_dialog":["I won't get to finish my game?","Or it's just the celestial lights.","We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.","I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.","Please, sit.","Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?","I'm going to bed now.","Yep, a man needs his rest.","Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.","Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.","Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed.","Again.","No!","Power in firebending comes from the breath , not the muscles.","The breath becomes energy in the body.","The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire!","Get it right this time.","No, you are impatient.","You have yet to master your basics.","Drill it again!","Very well, but first, I must finish my roast duck.","Duh?","Huh?","Good news for the Fire Lord.","The Fire Nation's greatest ''threat'' is just a little kid.","You mean the Avatar?","''Retired'' general.","Our ship is being repaired.","Yes.","I will do that.","It was incredible!","What?","Did we crash or something?","Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.","We would be honored to join you.","Do you have any ginseng tea?","It's my favorite.","Eh.. My fault, entirely.","More tea, please.","Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?","Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko.","They are your greatest weapons.","Basics, Zuko!","Break his root!","No, Prince Zuko.","Do not taint your victory.","So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat?","Disgraceful.","Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you.","Thanks again for the tea.","It was delicious.","Of course.","I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.","Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it.","Don't get too upset.","Okay then.","We have no idea where he is.","You really should open a window in here.","Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.","Are you going to finish that?","Over here!","You look tired, Prince Zuko.","Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?","You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little.","The temperature's just right.","I heated it myself.","Very well!","Who's there?","A meadow vole!","I should have known.","You startled me, little one.","It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.","Where are you taking me?","Right, but where, specifically?","Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.","I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se.","After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired.","And I'm still tired.","Nothing.","Actually, there is a bit of a problem.","My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.","That's right.","The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists.","It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.","Excellent form, Prince Zuko.","Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched.","Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!","Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord ''banished you''?","What if you're caught?","You give him too much credit.","My brother is not the understanding type!","Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?","Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters.","Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.","Please Prince Zuko!","If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do!","Do not follow the Avatar.","We're on a collision course!","Because he wants to follow you.","He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.","Actually, someone did.","I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.","Even more urgent.","It seems, I- -I have lost my lotus tile.","For my Pai Sho game.","Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.","See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value.","Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.","Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life.","I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.","I've checked all the shops on this pier.","Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.","Quite the contrary.","I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!","For music night on the ship.","Now, if we only had some woodwinds.","Oh, this place looks promising!","Oh, that is handsome!","Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?","Yeah, it kind of is.","Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?","It's no proverb!","Maybe it should be a proverb ...","Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this.","That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!","There is a storm coming.","A big one.","A storm is approaching from the north.","I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.","He doesn't mean that.","He's just all worked up.","Lucky guess.","Do you really want to know?","It's okay.","May I join you?","Try to understand.","My nephew is a complicated young man.","He has been through much.","Prince Zuko, what's wrong?","You're not missing anything, trust me.","These meetings are dreadfully boring.","Very well.","But you must promise not to speak.","These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?","Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out.","And there were dire consequences.","After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him.","He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect!","And there was only one way to resolve this.","When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.","It was no accident.","After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness.","As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar.","Only then could he return with his honor.","Things will never return to normal.","But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.","Look!","Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.","Your apology is accepted.","Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho!","Zhao has been promoted?","Well, good for him!","Excellent!","I take the pot!","But you're all improving!","I'm certain you will win if we play again.","Is everything okay?","It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.","Don't give up hope yet.","You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.","Where have you been, Prince Zuko?","You missed music night!","Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.","Aahh!","See Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being.","He means no offense!","I'm certain you bathe regularly!","Plus, we'll pay your weight in ''gold''.","You got it!","At my age, there's really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.","June!","No!","Shhh.","Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Four seasons ... four loves ... Four seasons ... for love.","No, it's about our plans.","There's a bit of a problem.","I'm afraid so.","He's taking everyone ... even the cook.","No!","Just rumors.","I don't think he is real.","The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.","It's a lovely night for a walk.","Why don't you join me?","It would clear your head.","Or just stay in your room and sit in the dark.","Whatever makes you happy.","Zuko!","Zuko ...","The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.","Yes ... pirates.","We had a run-in with them a while back.","They wanted revenge.","Yes, I accept.","It will be an honor to serve as your general.","To the Fire Nation!","Our plan is working perfectly.","Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.","No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup.","Someone's coming.","Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours.","Good luck.","Be careful what you wish for, Admiral.","History is not always kind to its subjects.","I hope not, for your sake.","We'll be landing soon.","Do you have a plan?","It's almost twilight, Admiral.","As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack.","The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight.","You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak.","If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.","I'm sorry.","I just nag you, because ... well, ever since I lost my son ... ...","I think of you as my own.","Remember your breath of fire.","It could save your life out there.","And put your hood up.","Keep your ears warm!","I don't need to remind you we have a time limit.","If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.","Remove the moon?","How?","What?","Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!","He is right Zhao.","You have been touched by the Moon Spirit.","Some of its life is in you.","I'm surprised Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.","Then you should rest.","A man needs his rest.","This is what I've been missing.","Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water, and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense?","I see.","It's the anniversary, isn't it?","Look at these magnificent shells!","I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.","To what do we owe this honor?","I'm sure your brother simply needs a moment.","It ''is'' unbelievable.","I have never known my brother to regret anything.","I care about you!","And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.","Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem.","Wait!","Don't leave without me!","Family sticks together, right?","I think we're safe here.","You're looking at the rare white dragon bush.","Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking.","That, or it's the white jade, which is poisonous.","Hmm ... delectable tea?","Or deadly poison?","Zuko, remember that plant I thought might be tea?","I did ... and it wasn't.","When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing.","But look what I found.","These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade.","That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness.","But where are we going to go?","We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation.","But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.","Whoops!","Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior.","Where do you live exactly?","Thank you for the duck.","It was excellent.","Much practice.","Junior, where are your manners?","You need to thank these nice people.","What are you doing?","These people just showed you great kindness.","Spare coins for weary travelers?","The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile!","Not professional anyway.","It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty!","They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se!","Where did you get these?","Mmmm ... ... mmmm!","Looks like you did some serious shopping.","But where did you get the money?","To be honest with you , the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.","I know we've had some difficult times lately.","We've had to struggle just to get by.","But it's nothing to be ashamed of.","There is a simple honor in poverty.","Zuko ...","Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems.","Not now.","No, Zuko!","You must never give in to despair.","Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.","In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself.","That is the meaning of inner strength.","You did?","Good, good.","Wait!","If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold.","I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first!","Ow ... That really hurt my tailbone.","Here is your tea.","You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.","Perhaps I am.","I wasn't thinking that.","I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.","You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support.","There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you.","Not that I love you, I just met you.","I've been tracking him actually.","I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there.","My pleasure.","Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.","I'm glad.","Get up!","My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.","Somehow, that's not so surprising.","Good.","That was very ... uhhh ... bracing.","No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down.","It's time to resume your training.","Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression.","It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is.","Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire.","It is precise and deadly, like Azula.","To perform the technique requires peace of mind.","Oh yeah, good point!","I mean, yes.","There is energy all around us.","The energy is both yin and yang.","Positive energy and negative energy.","Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies.","This creates an imbalance.","The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.","Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it.","You are simply its humble guide.","Breathe first.","I was afraid this might happen.","You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.","Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.","Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source.","True humility is the only antidote to shame.","I have another idea.","I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself.","Fire is the element of power.","The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want.","Earth is the element of substance.","The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong.","They are persistent and enduring.","Air is the element of freedom.","The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom.","Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!","Water is the element of change.","The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things.","They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.","It is important to draw wisdom from many different places.","If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.","Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.","It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful.","But it can make you more powerful, too.","You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.","Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy.","A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them.","I learned a way to do this with lightning.","If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it.","You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach.","The stomach is the source of energy in your body.","It is called the sea of chi.","Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean.","From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm.","The stomach detour is critical.","You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly.","You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this.","Now, are you focusing your energy?","Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?","Come on, you've got to feel the flow.","Excellent!","You've got it!","What, are you crazy?","Lightning is very dangerous!","Yeah!","But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you!","If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!","No please, don't stop just for me!","What now?","Colonel Mongke!","What a pleasant surprise!","Sure.","Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary.","Each one is a different kind of weapon specialist.","They are also a very capable singing group.","Would you like some tea first?","I'd love some.","How about you, Kahchi?","I make you as a jasmine man.","Am I right?","It's nice to see old friends.","Hmmm ... Old friends that don't want to attack me ...","So do we.","Ah, this is interesting.","I think I found our friend.","I don't think this is a gamble.","May I have this game?","Those who do can always find a friend.","I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.","He is.","Just watch.","You must forgive my nephew.","He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.","One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.","I'm afraid it's members only.","Wait out here.","Everything is taken care of.","We're heading to Ba Sing Se.","We can hide in plain sight there.","And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation.","Even I couldn't break through to the city.","Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace ... as a tourist!","What sort of king is he eating like?","So, Smellerbee.","That's an unusual name for a young man.","Oh, now I see.","It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!","It is a magnificent sight.","Once.","When I was a ... different man.","That's very noble of you.","I believe people can change their lives if they want to.","I believe in second chances.","It's pronounced Mushi.","Uh, no, no.","But may I just say you're like a flower in bloom.","Your beauty is intoxicating.","Ooh!","Jasmine please.","Blaugh!","Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it!","What a disgrace!","Hey!","I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ... it's just so sad!","What a handsome baby.","I just want our place to look nice, in case someone brings home a lady friend!","Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.","Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we start this afternoon!","Uh, does this possibly come in a larger size?","Blech!","This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!","How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?!","We'll have to make some major changes around here.","Would you like a pot of tea?","\"Sick of tea?\"","That's like being sick of breathing!","Have you seen the spark rocks to heat up the water?","I borrowed our neighbors'.","Such kind people.","The secret ingredient is love.","Please, son, you're confused!","You don't know what you're doing!","This poor boy is confused.","We're just simple refugees.","Oh, ho, ho.","That's very sweet.","No, it's not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion.","The moon flower likes partial shade.","Leaves from the vine, falling so slow.","Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam.","Little soldier boy, come marching home.","Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.","It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and seek to restore honor.","But not this time.","Run!","What are you doing?","With that stance?","With a poor stance, you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over.","With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat.","Much better!","But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type.","Of course!","While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.","Happy birthday, my son.","If only I could have helped you.","Leaves from the vine, falling so slow.","Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam.","Little soldier boy, come marching home.","Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.","You're right, Zuko.","I've seen that girl in here quite a lot.","Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.","He'd love to!","How was your night, Prince Zuko?","Uh, it's nothing.","Go back to sleep.","You did the right thing.","Letting the Avatar's bison go free.","Zuko!","You're burning up.","You have an intense fever.","This will help cool you down.","You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea.","Your critical decision.","What you did beneath that lake.","It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body.","You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew.","It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.","It's jook.","I'm sure you wouldn't like it.","Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow.","Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop?","Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you.","I am very thankful.","No.","I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me.","It means more than you know.","Yes, let's make some tea!","I'm brewing as fast as I can!","I ...","I can't believe it!","Great news!","We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King!","Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.","But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror.","Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea.","Destiny is a funny thing.","Maybe the Earth King overslept.","Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname \"The Dragon of the West\"?","It's more of a demonstration, really.","Come on!","You'll be fine!","I need your help.","May I come in?","Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.","She has captured my nephew as well.","I know how you must feel about my nephew.","But believe me when I tell you that there is ''good'' inside him.","I brought someone along who might help us.","None taken.","The key to both is proper aging.","What's on your mind?","Perfection and power are overrated.","I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.","I don't know the answer.","Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel.","You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, you will come to a better place.","Zuko, it's time we talked.","Go help you other friends.","We'll catch up with you.","You're not the man you used to be, Zuko.","You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been.","And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny.","It's time for you to choose.","It's time for you to choose good.","The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.","Zuko, I am begging you.","Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want.","You've got to get out of here!","I'll hold them off as long as I can!","No.","He wasn't.","You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko.","Sozin was your father's grandfather.","Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.","Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself.","Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko.","It is your nature, your legacy.","But, there is a bright side.","What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by ''you''.","Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation.","Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore ''balance'' to the world.","This is a royal artifact.","It's supposed to be worn by the Crown Prince.","Thank you, Ming.","Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me.","Thank you, Ming.","Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable.","I think you should take the rest of the day off.","You don't look well.","Maybe you should go home and rest.","Trust me.","It is better that you are not here this afternoon.","What a stunning view.","You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years.","The chances of finding him here are ''very'' slim.","Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment.","You should take some time to heal and rest.","You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing.","You never know how things are going to work out.","But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.","I was never angry with you.","I was sad because I was afraid you had lost your way.","But you found it again.","And you did it by yourself.","And I am so happy you found your way here.","Hmmm ... No, Zuko, it won't turn out well.","Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that I could, it would be the wrong way to end the war.","History would see it as just more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother to grab power.","The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.","No.","Someone new must take the throne.","An idealist with a pure heart and unquestionable honor.","It has to be ''you'', Prince Zuko.","Sozin's Comet is arriving, and our destinies are upon us.","Aang will face the Fire Lord.","When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se.","Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it ''back'' from the Fire Nation, so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.","Yes.","Zuko, you must return to the Fire Nation, so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order.","But Azula will be there, waiting for you.","Not alone!","You'll need help.","What do you think it is?","After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop, and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day.","Goodbye, everyone.","Today, destiny is our friend.","I know it.","Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power.","Hey, my belly's not that big anymore.","I've really trimmed down."]},"Aang":{"combined_dialog":["I need to ask you something

flying bison.","Don't worry, it'll wash out.","So do you guys live around here?","I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo!","I'm Aang.","Really?","It felt higher than that.","Sure am!","Well, if you guys are stuck,

sky.","You'll see.","Oh, I was smiling?","Hey.","What'cha thinkin' about?","Oh, no.","I didn't know him.","I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't.","Sorry.","Sleep tight.","Uh, why are they

little guy.","Wanna go sledding?","Heh heh.","I have a way with animals.","You got a deal!","Just one little problem ...","I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.","Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?","This isn't right.","A waterbender needs to master water.","What about the North Pole?","There's another Water Tribe up there, right?","Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.","But you forget, ''I'' have a flying bison.","Appa and I can ''personally'' fly you to the North Pole.","Katara, we're going to find you a master!","Well, you think about it, but in the

tight!","Yeah.","We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well -- -- we booby-ed right into it.","Don't blame Katara.","I brought her there.","It's my fault.","You should try it

anyway!","Sorry!","My staff!","Appa!","Hey, Katara.","Hey, Sokka.","Thanks for coming.","I dropped my staff.","I don't know.","I just sort of ... did it.","And how am I going to do that?","That's what the monks told me.","We can learn it together!","All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some ''serious'' business to attend to.","Here, here and here.","Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas.","Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.","Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys.","They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!","Wait 'til you see it, Katara!","The Air Temple is one of the most ''beautiful'' places in the world!","That's ''why'' I'm so excited!","I know, but I need to see it for myself.","Wake up, Sokka!","Air Temple, here we come!","Sokka!","Wake up!","There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!","Great!","You're awake!","Let's go!","Oh.","That was food?","I used it to start the campfire last night.","Sorry.","The Patola Mountain range!","We're almost there!","What about 'em?","Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all.","They probably escaped!","You don't understand, Katara.","The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison!","Right, Appa?","Yip yip!","There it is.","The Southern Air Temple.","We're home, buddy!","We're home.","So that's where my friends and I would play airball, and over there is where the bison would sleep, and ...

Whaaaahh!","Aaaah!","Whaaaahh!","I don't know.","It's my fault.","I'm sorry we came here.","I wanted to ride the elephant koi.","This island is named for Kyoshi?","I know Kyoshi!","I know her because I'm the Avatar.","That's me!","Now ... check this out!","All right!","Dessert for breakfast!","These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!","Mmm ... Katara you've got to try these!","Sokka, what's your problem?","''Eat!''","What's he so angry about?","It's great here.","They're giving us the royal treatment!","I'm sure we'll be fine.","Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town?","They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!","Come on, you know me better than that.","I'm just a simple monk.","There she is, girls.","Me in a past life.","Excuse me for a second, ladies.","Actually, I can't right now.","I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa.","Why don't you come with us?","It'll be fun!","Well, neither does carrying your basket.","Just a second, Koko!","It didn't.","You know what I think?","You just don't want to come because you're ''jealous.''","Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.","It ''is'' a little ridiculous, but I understand.","Katara, remember how Unagi almost got me yesterday?","Well, I'm gonna go ride it now.","It's gonna be ''real'' dangerous.","You're not going to stop me?","I know it's great.","I'm glad you're glad.","Fine!","Where're you going?","Don't leave!","Katara!","You showed up!","Back there you acted like you didn't care.","Me too.","I did let all that attention go to my head.","I was being a jerk.","On my way!","Katara ... don't ride Unagi.","Not fun.","Hey!","Over here!","Look what I brought to this place.","Yes, it is.","These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.","I'll call Appa.","Appa, yip yip!","I know, I know.","That was stupid and dangerous.","The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!","I used to always come here to visit my friend Bumi.","Well let's go, slow pokes.","The real fun's inside the city!","So what am I supposed to do?","Grow a mustache?","Now let's get to skippin', young whipper-snappers.","The big city awaits!","You guys are going to love Omashu.","The people here are the friendliest in the world.","Good idea!","Earthbending brings the packages up, and gravity brings them down.","They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes.","Um ...","The mail system?","A package-sending system?","Bumi, you're a mad genius!","I'm on it!","Yeah!","Good idea!","That'll make us go even faster!","Sorry!","Two cabbages please.","Thanks, but I don't eat meat.","I'm from ...

You're the spirit of this forest!","Now I understand.","You're upset and angry because your home was burned down.","When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.","Actually, I did have a little help and there's something else.","I need to talk to Roku and I think I found a way to contact his spirit.","There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him.","Yeah, and there's one more problem.","The island is in the Fire Nation.","But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means!","I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice.","That's today!","Thank you for your- Come on boy, we've got a long way to go.","Faster!","I'm on it!","Yeah.","But there's just one little problem.","If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade!","It's the ''only'' way.","This is exactly why I didn't want you to come!","It's too dangerous!","Appa, yip-yip!","Appa, are you okay?","Sokka!","We made it!","There it is!","The island where Roku's dragon took me.","You did it buddy.","Nice flying.","It's almost sundown.","We better hurry!","Great!","I am the Avatar!","I'll hold them off.","Run!","Nope!","Wrong way!","You do?","How?","Did you know Avatar Roku?","Is that how you knew I was coming?","If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?","They were waiting for me.","Thank you for helping me.","Shyu, what's wrong?","Definitely.","They're still locked!","Why, won't, it, open?!","I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.","Wait.","How is Sokka a genius?","His plan didn't even work.","Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years?","The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku.","So why isn't anything happening?","Why isn't anything happening?","I don't know what I'm doing!","All I know is airbending!","Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!","Is it about that vision?","The one of the comet?","What does it mean?","So the comet made them stronger?","But that happened a hundred years ago.","What does the comet have to do with the War ''now''?","But I haven't even started learning waterbending!","Not to mention earth and fire!","What if I can't master all the elements in time?","What if I fail?","But I won't be able to come back to the temple.","What if I have questions?","How will I talk to you?","I'm ready.","Thanks.","Where's Shyu?","It's what Avatar Roku said.","I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.","I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole.","What am I gonna do?","You'd do that?","Yeah!","Don't start without me, boy!","Oh right.","Time to practice waterbending.","You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes.","Like this?","Hey, I'm bending it already!","Well, you had to figure it all on your own.","I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.","So, what's next?","Sorry.","Well, don't stop now!","Keep 'em coming!","So, like this?","Looks like I got the hang of that move!","What else do you got?","Uh, sorry.","I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.","Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka.","I couldn't say no to this whistle!","Sure!","What are curios?","Huh?","Momo's not for sale.","Where did you get a waterbending scroll?","I know how to deal with these guys, Katara.","Pirates love to haggle.","Watch and learn.","Let's say to the price of, one copper piece!","Okay, two copper pieces!","Aye, we be casting off now!","What was that all about, Katara?","Well, well.","Look who's come to their senses.","Told you the haggling would pay off.","No thanks.","Grab on tight!","Just hang on!","I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.","No way!","Good one, Katara.","Well, what's done is done.","We have it, we might as well learn from it.","It's okay Katara.","What's wrong?","No Katara, it isn't.","Yeah, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth.","I'm over here!","Follow my voice!","I'm right here!","Uh, never mind!","I'll find you!","Run!","Katara, you're okay!","A team of rhinos, or two waterbenders.","Sokka, can't you make it go any faster?","Hey, you did the water whip!","Oh no ...","I knew a bison whistle would come in handy!","Thanks Appa.","That's okay Katara.","Good one, Katara.","Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- hey, where's the campfire?","And what happened to the tent?","Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve problems, action will.","Why don't you just switch jobs?","You see that?","Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar.","Come on, Momo, that's fair.","Appa's got five stomachs.","There it is, guys, The Great Divide.","I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding for a hundred years.","Uh, you could ''share'' the earthbender and travel together?","All right here's the deal, you're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across!","Does that seem fair?","Sorry, Appa, you'll have to do this on your own.","To tell you the truth, I'm not sure.","But when have I ever been?","Appa's going to take good care of you 'till we get there.","See you on the other side, buddy!","Yip yip!","Nice bending!","Why'd you do that?","What was that?","We're trapped in this canyon.","Look, sticking together is the only way to- Any ideas?","Enough!","I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen.","We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side.","We'll travel in two separate lines.","Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins.","See if you can find out why they hate each other so much.","Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing.","Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts!","Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts.","I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible.","Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.","Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?","What are you talking about?","Okay, okay I get it!","Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall.","Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.","Guys, focus!","How many times do I have to say it?","Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!","You know, I take it back.","Harsh words aren't so bad!","Is that ... food?","Everyone smuggled food down here?","Unbelievable!","You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day?","You're all awful!","So hungry.","Is that an egg custard in that tart?","Everybody, watch me and do what I do!","Now follow me!","We're riding out of this hole!","Everyone, get off!","Wait a second ... Jin Wei?","Wei Jin?","I know those guys!","Nope, just a regular ball.","That's what the game was called, redemption.","As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell \"redemption\"!","Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true.","But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field.","Good to see you, boy.","Did you miss me?","Well, you know I try.","You could call it luck.","Or you could call it lying.","I made the whole thing up.","Now where is that custard tart?","I'm starving!","Be careful, guys!","Guys?","Gyatso?","I'm okay.","I think I just need some rest.","Look at those clear skies, buddy!","Should be some smooth flying.","I think it's true, Katara.","Swishing means it's ripe.","Maybe we should find some shelter?","Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea.","Look at the sky.","I'm sorry for running away.","Actually, he wasn't.","I don't want to talk about it.","Well, it's kind of a long story.","I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar.","I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall.","I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.","First you got to form the ball, then you got to get on quick.","You kind of have to balance on it like it's a top.","I made it up.","How do you know it's me?","Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!","I just chose them because they seemed fun.","Well, I didn't know how to feel about it.","All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing.","Hey, not bad!","You guys have been practicing!","Great!","What's going on?","But I'm still the same!","Nothing's changed!","So, what?","I can't play?","Oh, okay.","What do you mean?","Hey!","Then, just when I was feeling better, something worse happened.","How could they do that to me?","They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!","I'm sorry I got so mad.","Well, that's not exactly what happened.","I was afraid and confused.","I didn't know what to do.","I never saw Gyatso again.","Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.","And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple.","My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.","The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.","The fisherman was right!","I did turn my back on the world!","You don't know that.","I'm going to find him!","We'll be back soon.","I promise.","Come on, Appa!","The boat!","There!","Hang onto the rope.","He doesn't have to apologize.","Actually, I don't eat meat.","Katara, I think you were right before.","I'm done dwelling on the past.","I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away.","I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it.","Appa!","How's Sokka doing?","I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea.","But I found a map.","There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain.","We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.","Not you too!","That's how Sokka started yesterday.","Now look at him!","He thinks he's an earthbender!","A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too.","I'm going to go find some medicine!","Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.","Keep an eye on them guys.","Hello, I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I ''need'' some medicine for my friends, they have fevers and they were coughing- That's nice.","That's nice.","Are you almost done?","Finally!","Thanks for all your help!","Ow!","Taking the cure to my friends.","What about my friends?","What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?","You're insane, aren't you?","Uh ...","I think you dropped this ... A frog!","I've never hidden from you!","Untie me and I'll fight you right now!","What?","No!","Don't leave, frogs!","My friends are sick and they need you!","Please go back to being frozen!","Who are you?","What's going on?","Are you here to rescue me?","I'll take that as a \"yes.\"","My frogs!","Come back!","And stop thawing out!","Wait!","My friends need to suck on those frogs!","Stay close to me!","Take this.","Jump on my back!","Give me the next one!","You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is?","I miss all the friends I used to hang out with.","Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon.","The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together.","He was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you.","If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?","Suck on these.","They'll make you feel better.","No, I don't think I did.","Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka.","Not tangled.","Woven!","I made you a necklace, Katara.","I thought since you lost your other one ...","I don't see why I can't do both.","You mean, all of you or just your neck?","I mean, because they both look great!","I ... well, uh ...","Thanks.","Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!","Make noise!","He'll run off!","And then run in zig-zags!","Whoa there!","Aunt who?","What do you know?","An umbrella!","Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.","Hello.","Aang.","I guess.","Likewise.","Good luck with that!","Yeah, dumb stuff like that ... Well, I've got to find a bathroom.","Yeah ... when I was in there ... Wow, that's a big crack.","Yeah, yeah, I knew that already.","But did it say anything about a girl?","Yes!","Really?","Thank you, Aunt Wu!","They sure are ...","Some stuff.","You'll find out.","That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny.","Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you.","I like you, but more than normal.","Never mind.","They seem happy, Sokka.","So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?","Well, there's this girl.","You do?","And you're okay with it?","Well, how do I do that?","You can be too nice?","Well, okay ... See you later ... Oh, hey, Katara.","I didn't see you there.","That's okay.","I'm busy with my own stuff.","So ... papaya.","You know me.","I don't really care what I eat.","Maybe aloof isn't my style.","Did you see that?","Excuse me.","Where can a guy find one of those things?","Not just any flower, a panda lily.","I've seen it in action and boy, does it work.","But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love.","Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.","Why should she be wrong about love?","There!","On the rim!","Oh no.","Aunt Wu was wrong.","There's no time to walk!","Grab on!","Hi, Katara.","But she doesn't even charge.","But they ''will'' listen to Aunt Wu!","Well, it's about to become the solution.","We're taking fate in our own hands.","First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.","Shhh!","We don't want anyone to hear us.","Oh, I didn't see you there.","Of course I like you.","Oh, I guess not.","I know what you mean.","Huh?","How did you know?","Oh, thanks ...","I guess.","Clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.","We still can save the village if we act fast.","Sokka has a plan.","If any of you are earthbenders, come with me.","Everyone needs to evacuate!","We'll come for you when it's safe!","By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.","Can I ask you something?","You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you?","You just told me what I wanted to hear.","Hey, look!","A sword made out of a whale's tooth.","So, then what happened?","Who the what now?","Hi, I'm Aang.","Thank you, it's truly an honor to be here.","If there's anything- Yeah, nothing's cozier than dead animal skins.","Hey, I ride animals, too!","There was this one time when I rode a giant eel and I- What's that story?","I can't believe they would leave me.","Uhhh, I know Bato!","It's the map to Sokka and Katara's dad!","Hey everyone!","Sorry I was gone so long.","Yup, but now I'm back.","Sure could go for some delicious sea prunes!","I'm sorry, I'll take care of this.","What's ice dodging?","What does that even mean?","I can't.","No, you can't trust me.","A messenger gave this to me for Bato.","You ''have'' to understand.","I was afraid you would- Okay.","You too.","Guess I should be moving on.","I'm an idiot, Momo.","Looks like we're going alone, guys.","Okay, I get it.","Everybody wants me gone.","Who?","Zuko.","A necklace?","Katara!","You've got something I want.","So ... where do we go?","Don't you want to see your father?","I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara.","Something to remind you ...","Still, just a little trinket.","Maybe something like ... this?","Zuko asked me to be ''sure'' I got it to you.","Sure.","When was the last time you saw your dad?","Sorry.","I didn't mean to bring that up.","I bet we'll find something to eat here, the Fire Day's Festival.","Fire Nation cultural exhibits, jugglers, benders, magicians ...","This would be a great place for me to study some real firebenders.","Hey, a poster of me!","I have to learn firebending at some point and this could be my only chance to watch a master's up close.","You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.","Ready disguises!","Let's go.","Hey, there's some food.","Hey, look at this.","I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.","I gotta learn that trick!","Oh!","Oh!","Me!","Me!","I want to get a closer look.","Awww!","That could've been me.","We gotta help her!","I'm calling Appa.","Appa!","Down here!","Nice touch setting off the fireworks.","You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?","We've gotta go see him!","He can train me!","Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me.","Is that where Jeong Jeong is?","I need to talk to him right away.","What happened?","Can I see Jeong Jeong now?","Why won't he see me?","Wait, how does he know that?","I'm going in, anyway!","Master, I need to learn firebending.","Okay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.","Please, I have to learn.","This could be my only chance.","Wait!","What do I do now?","But what am I concentrating on?","So when do I get to make some fire?","Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?","What?","You brought me up here to breathe?","I've been breathing for hours!","I want you to stop wasting my time!","I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun!","I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!","I thought about what you said, I promise I'll be more patient.","Oh yeah!","I mean, let us begin.","What's going on?","This is the ''worst ''firebending instruction ever!","All he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe!","But I'm ready to do so much more.","I did it!","I made fire!","Now ''that's'' some firebending!","I wonder how that juggler did it.","Katara!","I'm so sorry!","It was an accident!","I was, uh... Katara, I'm so-- I'm sorry, I didn't ...","I'm sorry!","Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready.","I wouldn't listen.","I'm never going to firebend again.","No, never again.","What?","How?","Where?","I have to help him!","Jeong Jeong!","You were Jeong Jeong's student?!","Whoa!","Wild shot!","No self-control ... Oh, were we fighting?","I thought you were just getting warmed up!","Is that all you got?","Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!","Ahoy!","I'm Admiral Zhao!","I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko.","Sloppy.","Very sloppy.","You've lost this battle.","''No'', but ''you'' have.","Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.","Have a nice walk home!","Wait!","Where's Jeong Jeong?","Wow, that's good water.","Two?","Aren't airbender stories the greatest?","I laugh at gravity all the time.","Gravity.","Hey!","Thanks for the story.","It means a lot to hear airbender stories.","It must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met them.","Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple.","This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo.","Hey, guys, look at this!","No, they're not.","Gliding maybe, but not flying.","You can tell by the way they move, they're not airbending.","Those people have no spirit.","Yeah, I know.","But I can do more than fancy gliding.","Thanks.","This place is unbelievable.","No, just unbelievable.","This is supposed to be the history of my people.","Ugh!","It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined.","Do you know what you did!?","You just destroyed something sacred!","For a stupid bathhouse!","This whole place stinks!","This is a sacred temple!","You can't treat it this way!","I've seen it when the monks were here!","I know what it's supposed to be like!","What are you doing?","Who said you could be here?","Our gliders.","Nature knows where to stop.","I just can't get over it.","There's not a single thing that's the same.","I'm sorry.","This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was.","I want it to stay that way.","Thanks.","Spirit.","Spirit.","That's the something you're talking about.","Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!","Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one!","I've been thinking.","If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.","This is a nightmare.","You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!","When are they coming?","You can't give them more weapons.","The deal's off.","I'll tell you how.","We have something they don't.","Air power.","We control the sky.","That's something the Fire Nation can't do.","We can win!","Good.","We'll need it.","We'll have to start without it.","We've got them on the run!","We need more slime!","Look!","They're retreating!","You know what?","I'm really glad you guys all live here now.","I realized, it's like the hermit crab.","Maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home.","And now you protect each other.","There it is!","We'll find a master to teach us, no problem.","My friend and I can't wait to start training with you!","After we relax for a couple of days.","Good morning, Master Pakku!","Uhhh ...","This is my friend, Katara.","The one I told you about?","Yeah, they're not fair!","If you won't teach Katara, then ... Then I won't learn from you!","I'm trying ... That bad?","Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.","Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.","That was amazing!","I was just showing Katara a few moves.","I'm sorry, I ... Uhhh ... Katara?","I'm sure she didn't mean that.","You don't have to do this for me.","I can find another teacher.","Go, Katara!","Go get her.","Hey, Katara!","Good to see you here.","I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out.","I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people.","I'm going to make a difference this time.","Yip-yip!","I'll take it from here, boy.","Appa!","Thanks for the rescue, buddy!","You've got to be kidding me ...","I can't do it ...","I can't do it.","I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them.","I can't fight them all.","I'm just one kid.","The spirits!","Maybe I can find them and get their help!","So, is this the way to the Spirit World?","I never thought I'd miss grass this much!","You're right, Yue.","I can feel ... something.","It's so tranquil.","How about some quiet?","Come on guys, I can hear every word you're saying!","Hello?","I'm sorry to disturb you.","I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean Spirits.","Yes, I need - Come back!","Roku, the Water Tribe's under attack.","I need to find the Ocean and the Moon Spirits.","Who?","You're just a curly tailed blue nose.","Aaahhh!","Show no fear.","Show no emotion at all.","Hello?","I-I'm looking for a spirit named 'Koh'.","Thank you.","You know me?","I didn't know that.","Why did he, or ''I'', try to kill you?","I need to find the moon and the ocean.","Please.","Help me find them.","An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help.","What do you mean?","How can I find them and protect them?","The koi fish!","I must be going now.","The spirits are in trouble, I need to get back to the physical world.","This is where I came in, but how do I get back?","Momo!","Momo.","Oh no, where's my body?","It's good to be back.","Appa!","Wait, we can't just leave him here.","No, if we leave him he'll die.","I feel it, too.","The Moon Spirit is in trouble.","Zhao, don't!","Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe.","It will hurt everyone, including you.","Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance.","You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world.","No, it's not over.","Come here.","Appa, yip yip!","I try not to think about it too much.","What?","No I'm not!","See, it's this special state where- Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there.","General Fong?","I'm in.","I'll fight the Fire Lord.","I told the general I'd help him, by going into the Avatar State.","Katara, I'm just being realistic!","I don't have time to do this the right way!","Ten-fold energy, huh?","Is it working?","Is it working?","I can't tell!","Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar State 'cause I don't have a good view of myself!","Am I talking too loud?","I love surprises!","Still not glowing.","This is just mud!","Sure.","I'm really glad you told me that.","But I still need to do this.","No, you don't.","Every day, more and more people die.","I'm already one hundred years late.","Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war.","I have to try it!","Good night.","Sokka!","Sokka, wake up.","I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar State.","Yes.","Do you think the general will be mad?","The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose.","So I guess that's it.","I'm sure.","I can only reach the Avatar State when I'm in genuine danger.","What are you doing?","I'm not your enemy!","I won't fight you!","You can't fight forever!","Stop this!","You have to let her go!","I'm trying ...","I'm trying!","You don't need to do this!","What do you mean?","You're out of your mind.","So you were showing me the octopus form?","Oh, yea ... thanks.","Just ... people.","You guys are nomads?","That's great!","I'm a nomad!","I know ... you just said that.","Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories.","These guys have been everywhere!","They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler!","Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground.","And we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable ...","So all you need to do is trust in love to get through these caves?","We can make it.","Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map also.","We found the exit!","No.","It's a tomb.","How are we going to find our way out of these tunnels?","What?","Katara, what is it?","Right ... Where are you going with this?","Us ... ''kissing'' ... Yeah.","I definitely wouldn't want to kiss ''you''!","No, no, I mean ... if there was a choice between kissing you and ''dying'' ... What?","I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment.","What is ''wrong'' with me ... We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we?","Then, what are we going to do?","They're made of some kind of crystal.","They must only light up in the dark.","So, uh ... What about Sokka?","Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way.","So are you guys going to come to Omashu with us?","Okay.","Thanks for everything, Moku.","No, I'm going in to find Bumi.","What?","If he's still what?","This isn't about finding a teacher.","This is about finding my friend.","That answer your question?","Thank you, sewer friends.","Somewhere he can't earthbend.","Somewhere made of metal.","So, is King Bumi with you guys?","Is he leading the resistance?","Actually there's another path to freedom.","You could leave Omashu.","You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation.","But you're outnumbered.","You can't win.","Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.","No.","I'm not leaving until I find Bumi.","Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later.","Flopsie!","Come on, Flopsie.","You gotta help me find Bumi.","Yip Yip!","Oh ...","I guess that doesn't work with you.","Let's go!","We looked everywhere.","No Bumi.","It's from the Fire Nation governor.","He thinks we kidnapped his son.","So ... he wants to make a trade.","His son for King Bumi.","I don't think so.","I'm sure the governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi.","It's a new day.","I have a good feeling about this.","He's here.","We're ready to trade.","Bumi!","Hang on!","We're gonna get you out of here.","It's just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?","It's good to see you too!","Hang on, Bumi!","Our ride's here!","You could earthbend?","All along?","I don't understand.","Why didn't you free yourself?","Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded?","What's the matter with you, Bumi?","I know!","There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating.","There are ''three'' jings?","That's why you surrendered, isn't it?","I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.","Hey, Momo!","What?","I didn't even notice.","I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me.","No, I ...","I think it wants us to land there.","I don't know.","Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth.","Do you want me to ignore it?","Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this, bye swamp.","Yip, Yip!","Where's Appa and Momo?","Appa!","Momo!","No, and the tornado ... it just disappeared.","Maybe we should be a little nicer to the swamp.","Sokka, the longer we're here, the more I think you shouldn't be doing do that.","Except for them.","Guys?","Katara!","Appa!","Hello?","Who are you?","Hey, come back!","Who are you?","I was chasing some girl.","I don't know.","I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress.","What about me?","I didn't know the girl I saw.","And all our visions led us right here.","Yeah, the center ... it's the heart of the swamp.","It's been calling us here.","I knew it.","Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us!?","We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land.","I get how the tree is one big thing, but the whole world?","But what about my vision?","It was someone I had never met.","Time is an illusion.","So, it's someone I will meet.","I think I know how to find them.","Everything is connected.","Come on!","We've got to hurry!","Appa!","But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?","My staff!","Yip yip!","Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.","Avatar Day?","There's a holiday for the Avatar.","Who knew?","Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated.","That's the biggest me I've ever seen!","That party pooper's my friend!","No, I'm not, I ...","It's true!","I'm on your side.","You think that I ... murdered someone?","Huh!","Give me a chance to clear my name!","I'll gladly stand trial!","No problem.","How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?","I can't.","I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either.","I need you guys to help prove my innocence.","That's okay, Sokka.","For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective.","So, you'll help me with my case?","You think so?","I don't know ... You guys are great.","Then how can I prove my innocence?","Right ... evidence.","Ladies and gentlemen ...","I'm about to tell you what really happened.","And I will prove it with facts.","Fact number one.","Uhhh ... Oh, yeah.","You see ...","I have very large feet.","Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue.","But ...","I was in a painting at sunset.","So, there you have it, I'm not guilty.","Hey, everybody!","Avatar Kyoshi here.","So, what just happened?","I said I would face justice, so I will.","Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.","Look!","There's a coupon on the back!","The first lesson is free.","Ehhh, he's not the one.","Excuse me, but where is this earthbending tournament, exactly?","How'd you get them to tell you?","Hey, front row seats!","I wonder why no one else is sitting here.","I don't know.","Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth.","He's just listening to his big muscles.","What do you think, Sokka?","I think she is.","She waited ... and listened.","I will!","I don't really want to fight you.","I want to talk to you.","Please, wait!","Please, listen!","I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you!","Wait!","If we want to find the Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a great place to start.","We need to talk to her.","Do you guys know where she lives?","That's because we're asking about the wrong person.","In my vision, I saw a girl, in a white dress, with a pet flying boar.","Know anybody like that?","A flying boar is good enough for me.","Let's check it out.","That's the flying boar from my vision.","Come on!","How did you know it was me?","Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth.","And then I had a vision in a magic swamp, and - Allow me.","I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first.","Then she must be a great earthbender!","Probably good enough to teach someone else!","Ow!","Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is.","What's ''your'' problem?","Good night, buddy.","That's amazing.","Is that why you became the Blind Bandit?","Then why stay here where you're not happy?","You could come with us.","Go, I'll be okay.","Hit it harder!","I'm sorry, Toph.","Not like her.","Toph!","What are you doing here?","You're going to be a great teacher, Toph.","Okay.","That's not gross, it's just a part of spring!","You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat.","And a great beard!","Sorry!","What is it?","Better safe than sorry.","Should we do something?","Okay, okay, you both need to calm down.","I ... can see that.","I don't think so, Sokka.","That's impossible.","There's no way they could have tracked us.","Maybe we should face them.","Find out who they are.","Who knows, maybe they're friendly.","Appa, yip yip!","Sokka, we'll be okay.","We can't keep flying forever.","So what's our plan?","Appa fell asleep!","Wake up, buddy!","Appa's exhausted.","All right, all right, everyone's exhausted!","Let's just get some rest.","No!","No, she's not blaming you.","What?","You're blaming Appa?","How dare you blame Appa!","He saved your life three times today!","If there's anyone to blame it's you!","You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not.","He is!","Appa's carrying your weight.","He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us!","What did I just do?","I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher.","Now she's gone.","I have a plan.","Toph was right.","The fur was leaving a trail right to us.","But now that he's clean, no more trail.","He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.","I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off-course.","All right, you've caught up with me.","Now, who are you and what do you want?","So what now?","I'm not running.","Zuko!","\"Zuzu\"?","Katara!","Today's the day!","Can you believe it?","After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending!","And this place, it's perfect, don't you think?","Sokka?","Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?","Sorry.","Good morning, Sifu Toph.","Well, if you think I should ...","So what move are you going to teach me first?","Rock-a-lanche?","The Trembler?","Oh, maybe I could learn to make a whirlpool out of land!","Sounds good, sounds good!","Like a rock.","Got it.","I'm ready.","Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle?","Whoa!","Yeah, thanks, Katara!","I guess I just panicked.","I don't know what to say.","I know.","I'm sorry.","No, I don't think I do.","Yeah, that sounds good.","I don't want to talk about it.","I know, I know, I know, I know!","I get it, all right?","I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it.","I don't know why I can't, but I can't.","I guess it's earth.","Thanks, Katara.","''Sifu'' Katara.","As a matter of fact, I don't mind.","I'm happy to share anything I have.","Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ...","It's a delicate instrument!","Meditating here!","We'll find him faster if we split up.","Sokka!","Are you okay?","Hmmm ...","I bet I can airbend you out of here.","I can't ...","I can't do it.","I can't do that either.","It would just be really ... uncomfortable.","Thanks, Sokka.","This whole earthbending thing really has me confused.","There's so much pressure.","Everyone expects me to get it right away.","It puts me in a really awkward position.","If I try, I fail.","If I don't try, I'm never going to get it.","I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.","Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub.","It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in.","What are you doing out here little guy?","Did you lose your mama?","Hey there, we found your cub!","See, we have no problem with you!","We're friendly!","Oh no!","Woo-hoo, look at me!","I won't.","What?","You were there the whole time?","Why didn't you do something?","Sokka was in trouble!","I was in trouble!","You could have gotten him out and helped us get away!","Enough!","I want my staff back!","What?","I can't believe it!","No problem, Sokka!","Hey Katara, look what I can do!","Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now!","The key is being completely rooted.","Physically and mentally unmovable!","Shh!","I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise.","Just watch.","Yeah!","I'm putting an orchestra together.","I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.","I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara.","I've been training my arrow off!","Your turn, Katara.","Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?","Oh, yeah, I've been there.","It's a pristine natural ice spring.","And I usually don't use the word \"pristine\".","It's one of nature's wonders.","Must've changed ownership since I was here.","No worries, I clean up easy.","Thanks, I try.","The Southern Temple.","Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?","Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.","Don't worry, buddy.","I'm not making you go underground ever again.","You can stay out here with Toph.","Nothing.","We just like architecture.","What do you have against humans?","Ow.","Uh, yeah, I'll vouch.","We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit.","You have my word.","Uh ... oh, I know!","Hah!","Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things.","I always knew I was special.","Sokka, where are you going?","Firebenders.","Wow, I got to hand it to you, Sokka.","You picked the best mini-vacation for sure.","Great, you must have broken it.","We had no choice.","Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love.","What are you doing?","We've gotta get back to the surface!","Why are we doing this?","You can't possibly check every single date.","Come on, eclipse.","Where's Appa?","You could've come to get us.","I could've saved him!","You just didn't care!","You never liked Appa!","You wanted him gone!","That's all any of you guys care about, yourselves!","You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!","I'm going after Appa.","Appa!","Appa!","No ... No!","What's the difference?","We won't survive without Appa.","We all know it.","It doesn't matter.","None of those will tell us where Appa is.","I'm awake.","I couldn't sleep.","Appa!","Maybe we can find some sandbenders.","Yeah ... look at the shape.","Momo!","I'm not losing anyone else out here.","You tell me where he is now!","Tell me where Appa is!","So, did you figure out what route we're going to take?","Katara, it's okay.","I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.","So, you guys are headed to Ba Sing Se, too?","Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.","Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports.","That won't be necessary.","Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?","I'm doing fine.","Would everybody stop worrying about me?","I'll talk to the lady for you.","But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen!","You have to make an exception!","What if we gave them our tickets?","But ... Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely.","I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass.","I don't know.","The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it.","Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa.","We need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this path.","You saw what I did out there.","I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself.","I hated feeling like that.","Thank you for your concern, Katara.","I'll distract it.","Katara, get everyone across!","I've been going through a really hard time lately.","But you've made me ... hopeful again.","I thought I was trying to be strong.","But really I was just running away from my feelings.","Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you.","I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can.","I just really need to do this.","I know.","Thank you, Katara.","You ready, Momo?","Sorry Momo, Appa's going to have to wait.","I was, but something stopped me.","Something big.","That.","I'm the Avatar.","Take me to whoever is in charge.","Not needed?","The question is, how are we going to stop that thing?","You're the idea guy.","We'll take it down from the inside.","Where are we going to get something like that?","What are you doing?","Someone's going to hear us!","I don't know how many more of those I have in me.","Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through.","Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike.","Sokka, take a fighting stance.","You've got to be quick and accurate.","Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance.","And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.","His own weight becomes his downfall, literally.","Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow.","Everyone inside that wall.","The whole world is counting on us.","That's enough!","We need to get to the next one!","Whoa!","Guys, get out of here.","I know what I need to do.","This looks like a good spot, Momo.","General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!","What I'd give to be a metalbender.","Momo, get out of here!","Thanks, Momo.","I owe you one.","Now all I need ... Actually, that is what I need for once.","I kind of like that one.","It's such a big city.","This is why I never came here before.","I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live.","Can we see the king now?","If we're going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa.","Nice to meet you, Pong.","You mean, platypus bear?","Gopher bear?","Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty.","Your Momo-ness.","Earth!","Wow, you look beautiful.","Where are they?","Or we could go in as these guys.","Toph said we might pass as busboys!","Where are Toph and Katara?","I don't know what he looks like.","That could be ''anyone''!","You found us!","Sorry.","No, don't shout.","Watch this, everybody!","Greetings, Your Majesty.","This could be the most important thing he's ever heard.","I'll tell them!","I'll make sure everyone knows!","Hey there, fellow.","You look hungry.","What kinda animal is that?","Let's do it!","There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city.","Don't worry, I'm great with animals.","This was so much easier in my head.","Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?","Appa!","Appa!","Appa!","No.","No!","I guess this means we'll always be together.","Always.","I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy.","But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth.","About the conspiracy and the War.","We need to talk to you.","See?","We're friends, Your Earthiness.","Over here.","Well, sir, there's a war going on right now.","For the past one hundred years in fact.","The Dai Li's kept it secret from you.","It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.","Right there!","Appa bit him!","Oh, yeah.","If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real.","I wish it wasn't.","It's still there!","We don't have much time.","There's a comet coming this summer.","Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength.","They'll be unstoppable.","Secret files?","It's from the Eastern Air Temple.","I can't believe it.","There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple.","He says he's a guru.","No, a spiritual expert.","He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey.","He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.","Split up?","We just found Appa and got the family back together!","Now you want us to separate?","Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad.","Katara?","I need to tell you something.","I've been wanting to say it for a long time.","Katara, I- Yeah.","Yeah.","Girls are waiting for us.","Thanks, positive attitude.","You haven't seen your dad in over two years.","You must be so excited!","Don't be nervous.","He's going to be so happy to see you!","Not at all.","I'm ready to master the Avatar State.","I'll do whatever it takes.","See you in a week.","Yip yip!","Uhhh ... hello?","You're Guru Pathik, right?","The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?","In your note, you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State.","How?","Uggh!","It tastes like onion and banana juice!","What are chakras?","So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?","The creek can't flow?","The energy flows!","I'll do whatever it takes.","Water Chakra?","I ran away.","I hurt all of those people.","My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.","I'm never going to firebend again.","I can't.","Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else.","Pickles?","Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?","Because I never wanted to be.","Like the four nations.","We're all connected.","Everything is connected.","This is the last chakra, isn't it?","Let's do this.","What?","Why would I let go of Katara?","I ...","I love her!","Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara?","How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her?","Three chakras ago that was a good thing!","I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.","Okay, I'll try.","Katara's in danger!","I have to go!","I don't know.","In my vision, I just knew she needed help.","Uh ...","I'm great!","It went great with the guru.","I completely mastered the Avatar State.","Yeah.","But, in my vision, I felt so sure she was in trouble.","Okay.","Maybe you're right.","Momo!","Katara ''is'' in trouble!","I knew it!","You guys know each other?","She must have Katara.","Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.","Katara's in trouble.","All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble.","Working together is our best chance.","So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea!","Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this ''great'' power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love.","And I just couldn't.","What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula?","Without the Avatar State, what if I'm not powerful enough?","Saving you, that's what.","There's too many.","I'm sorry, Katara.","What happened?","Oh no!","Momo?","Are you sure?","I feel like I'm dreaming.","Sokka?","Why are we on a Fire Nation ship?","Why is everyone dressed this way?","And why am I the only one who's completely out of it?","I have hair?","How long was I out?","Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda.","Are you mad at your dad or something?","Mmm, a little higher.","Uhhh!","Wow, you're definitely in the right area there.","I went down!","I didn't just get hurt, did I?","It was worse than that.","I was ''gone''!","But you brought me back.","You saved me.","So what now?","Me?","The world thinks I'm dead?","How is that good news?","That's terrible!","No, no, no, no, no.","You have no idea.","This is so messed up!","I'll handle this.","The Avatar is back.","I hate not being able to do anything.","I just can't stand by and do nothing!","Fine.","Well, I am pretty hungry.","Maybe dinner's a good idea.","I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly!","You're right, I don't.","But the problem is, I did fail!","It ''is'' true.","I was in Ba Sing Se.","I was there!","But I lost.","And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good.","And I hate the invasion plan, too!","I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes!","I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord.","But now I know I need to do it alone.","Katara, please!","Just go ... please.","I need to redeem myself.","I need my honor back.","A blockade.","I'm not gonna make it.","I failed.","Roku?","But everyone thinks I'm dead again.","They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war.","I'm letting the whole world down.","I don't know.","You're right.","I won't give up.","I have so much to do.","What about the invasion?","It's okay.","If someone saw it, it would give away my identity.","It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive.","I think I see a cave below.","Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out.","If we get Fire Nation disguises, we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.","I don't know about this.","These clothes belong to somebody.","But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit!","Ta-dah!","Normal kid.","Uh ... your mom's necklace.","I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago.","So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool.","Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, \"stay flamin'\".","Greetings, my good hotman.","Oh, we're going to a meat place?","You guys go ahead.","I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Who, me?","That's right.","Let the molding begin.","Yeah, the colonies, of course.","The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom.","Sorry, ma'am.","Um ...","I have a scar.","It's really embarrassing.","Just \"slob\" is fine.","Or, uh, Kuzon.","We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun.","What monkey?","Wow.","You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.","It was nice meeting you.","I guess I'm just lucky.","I'd love to.","I got invited to play with some kids after school.","I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow.","Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation.","I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai.","And here's one that I made out of noodles!","I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then.","It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace.","We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow.","Flamey-O, hotman!","Fire Lord ... forefathers ... Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah.","Is that a trick question?","The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military.","Sozin defeated them by ambush.","I'll just write down my best guess.","I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist.","I was just dancing.","You do dances here in the homeland, right?","But what about expressing yourself?","Thanks On Ji.","I could show it to you again if you like.","Ah!","Just some dance movements.","Parents?","But- I'm not ready to leave yet.","I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid.","You don't know what it's like, Sokka.","You get to be normal all the time.","Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation.","If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom.","I'm gonna throw them, a secret dance party!","Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork!","Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back.","I know, you got fancier feet than anybody.","And six of 'em!","Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's!","Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving.","This is when you start dancing.","Oh boy.","Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about.","It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.","Sure you do, you have for generations!","It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances.","A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'.","And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'.","And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se.","Yeah, that's it!","That's the sound of happy feet.","All right, go with that!","Everybody freestyle!","Take my hand.","Don't worry about them.","It's just you and me right now.","Uh-oh.","I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all.","Momo!","Oh Momo!","Hahahahaha!","You found me, buddy!","Hey guys, I think this river's polluted.","Hey, maybe we can get food there!","Now you look just like a little hill with horns!","Bye, buddy!","Thanks for the ride!","Let's just get what we need and go.","But we just saw you.","You're even wearing the same clothes.","The only difference is your hat.","I don't get it.","What?","What's the matter Katara?","He doesn't look sick.","You okay, buddy?","His tongue is purple!","That can't be good.","Katara, can you heal him?","Yeah, are the people ... happier?","Is that why this place seems so festive?","Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka.","It's more like ... What's the matter, buddy?","It's her!","Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!","Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule.","Wait!","But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine!","I know Hei Bai!","We're close personal friends!","Heeey!","My name's Aang.","I'm the Avatar.","Yeah, me too.","I hate that.","You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit.","I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive.","You seem familiar too.","No, you ''really'' seem familiar.","Katara?","You're the Painted Lady?","But how?","So you've been sneaking out at night?","Wait, is Appa even sick?","I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people.","No, I think it's great!","You're like a secret hero!","You wanna destroy this factory?","Hey, I just found out this morning!","Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village!","He really does have a heart, doesn't he?","Aha, I knew it!","I knew you were the same guy.","You're the shop owner ''and'' the boat guy.","No, I just saw you!","You switched hats and called yourself a different name!","Not if we can stop it!","Toph, let's make a trench to stop the fire from coming any closer.","Keep an eye on Momo.","Sokka, stand clear!","Good work, everybody.","These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night.","Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time?","I mean, look at Katara's hair, right?","What's up with that?","Nothing.","I was just trying to ... What do you think?","Pretty slick, huh?","All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword.","It's where I get a sword handle and then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade.","Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.","I'll just stick to what I got.","That's it!","That's what you needed all along, Sokka.","Not the sword, a master.","We've all had masters to help us get better.","You should see if you can study with Piandao.","Twice?","How hot is it?","I guess the jokes don't run in the family.","No, we're over on this island.","Sokka!","Say something funny!","The White Lotus.","Huh.","What?","I'm wearing trunks.","Whoa!","Let's go again!","We can't!","Jump on Appa!","I'll try to distract him!","I'm okay.","Okay, Roku.","There it is.","That's Roku's home.","Where're we going?","You don't have to tell me.","Wait, whose party is it?","Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple!","No way!","He's air surfing!","I can't believe I never thought of that.","That's amazing!","I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was!","Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you're alive!","This is amazing, Roku!","You're battling a volcano, and you're winning.","Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it?","Roku?","Roku!","No, that's wrong.","I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all.","Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right?","If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil.","Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance.","And I also think it was about friendships.","I don't see why not.","Okay.","I'm ready for some training.","Are we taking a break?","Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud.","Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me.","Yeah!","So, guys.","What are we gonna get with our last silver piece?","Flamey-O, Toph.","Toph got us money.","She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like.","Katara, I'll personally make you an Avatar Promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams.","Wow, how does it work?","Well.","I, uh- Yes, ma'am.","Sure.","I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.","I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.","I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.","Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?","Where do you think anyone is?","Sokka, watch out!","It's Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man!","We should split up.","He can't chase us both.","I think I like \"the man with a sword for a hand\" better.","All right, now I'm getting scared.","I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.","Helping people ... that's what I do.","She could be home any minute.","Okay, that's pretty creepy.","We shouldn't be doing this.","Guys, I don't know about this ... Great ...","I'd steer clear of the sea prunes.","Close enough.","This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation.","I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.","Excuse me, sir.","Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?","Old Man Ding?","Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?","I didn't know spirits made prisons like this.","Who brought you here?","We have to stop Hama!","Give up!","You're outnumbered!","This feels weird!","It's okay!","Wait!","Four days?","The invasion's in ''four'' days?","I guess.","Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!","I'm bringing you down.","Oh no!","It was just a dream, Momo.","I still have my pants.","Well, I better keep training.","A couple hours.","I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai.","You don't get it, do you?","My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending.","Not even the basics.","Okay, well I still have to work on everything else.","I better spend the whole day training.","Good night, Katara.","Good night, Sokka.","Good night, Toph.","Good night, Appa.","Good night, Momo.","Good night, Appa and Mo- Math test?","Oh no!","I forgot all about the math test!","I've gotta be ready.","But I forgot my pants and my math test.","Sokka, get up!","I needa know what day it is!","Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises.","In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you were too slow and they got you!","Then climb that cliff!","Climb it fast!","Don't drink that!","In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom!","We died because of your tiny bladder.","And you need to start wearing your hair up.","In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-.","You're right.","I'm losing my mind.","It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed.","I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves.","I feel ... really warm.","Like there's this warm feeling all around me.","This heat.","Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me!","And the whole world is being engulfed in flames!","You ''know'' what's bothering me.","I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.","You said it yourself!","He's the baddest man on the planet!","I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world!","Okay!","But what can I do to feel better?","Pound away.","Ow!","Toph ...","I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me!","Thanks for everything, guys.","Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better.","Maybe.","It's the nightmares.","They just get worse and worse.","No.","That won't help.","Nothing helps.","There's only one thing I can do!","I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!","Invasion.","All aboard for the invasion.","I told you, I can't go back to sleep.","Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think.","And I've realized some big things, Katara.","I see everything so clearly now.","What really matters.","Why I'm really doing this.","I'm doing it to save the world.","But more than that.","I'm doing it for the people I love.","I'm doing it for you, Katara.","I'm saying, I love you!","What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time.","Baby, you're my forever girl.","Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream.","Uh, living underwater?","Put 'em up, Fire Lord!","Ozai's defense is impeccable.","I'll have to try a different approach.","You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord?","Momo, did you hear something?","That's more like it.","I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me.","Oh, Momo, let me explain.","Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares.","They were just too much.","Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it.","You guys, come on.","Sokka, what do we do?","About that!","Come on, guys.","We're all on the same side.","I just need to jump in a cold waterfall!","Oh, look.","Another hallucination.","An imaginary bed made out of clouds.","Look!","You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't!","The invasion's tomorrow!","No, Katara!","There's still ''so'' much I haven't learned.","I don't need sleep.","What I ''need'' is practice.","Quick, hit me!","You really think so?","Thanks, guys.","You know what?","I think I am ready.","Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!","No, Fire Lord Ozai.","''You're'' not wearing any pants.","I can't.","When Azula shot me with lightning, my seventh chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe.","Toph, this is Haru.","When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation.","So he had to hide his earthbending.","A new glider!","This is amazing!","Oh ... well, I'm sure that will come in handy.","We've been looking everywhere for you.","The boats are ready to leave.","What?","Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth.","That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that.","Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se.","I won't let myself fail again.","So, this is it huh?","I'm ready.","Katara, I ... You go first.","Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it.","What if ... what if I don't come back?","What do you know?","It ''did'' come in handy.","That's strange.","The Avatar is back!","Hello?","Anyone home?","He wasn't home.","No one was.","The entire palace city is abandoned.","We can still do this.","We can still win the day.","I've gotta try.","Do you feel anything down there?","Stay safe.","We'll be back soon.","How is that careful?","Climb aboard and hold on tight.","Thanks!","I'm ready.","I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.","Where is he?","Where's the Fire Lord?","I can't pin her down!","She's too quick!","Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?","Sokka, she won't talk.","Maybe it's not too late.","The eclipse is over.","But I can face the Fire Lord anyway.","But I'm ready!","I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.","I guess you guys are right.","They've got air power, but so do I!","I'm gonna do what I can to slow them down.","Let's join the others!","They're heading for the beach ...","They're gonna destroy the submarines!","Thank you all for being so brave and so strong.","I'm gonna make this up to you.","I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while.","The Western Air Temple!","Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people.","No, she's right.","We ''are'' here!","Why can't I go?","Fair enough.","So, what's the new plan?","Oh, yeah.","That's great, no problem.","I'll just do that.","Well, it's not even gonna be possible!","Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?","Yeah ... right.","Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.","Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody.","Why don't we just take a nice tour around the temple?","What?","The wind is too loud in my ears!","Check out this loop!","Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table!","Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber!","There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done.","We'll never let you join us.","I kind of have a confession to make.","Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?","Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out.","He risked his life to save me.","You're probably right.","Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple!","I'm'' not ''having Zuko as my teacher!","You what?","But he did firebend at you?","I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right.","After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice.","I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko.","I think you ''are'' supposed to be my firebending teacher.","When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again.","But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love.","I'd like you to teach me.","Not so fast.","I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them.","Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned.","What do you think?","Sokka?","Katara?","Okay.","Not something to fear.","Maybe I need a little more instruction.","Perhaps a demonstration?","I thought it was ... nice.","Maybe it's the altitude.","That one kind of felt hot.","Sorry, Sifu Hotman.","I don't know.","Maybe it isn't.","Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.","That's amazing, Toph!","I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison.","Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy.","Okay, okay.","I'm sorry.","Sun Warriors?","Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid.","It's like the monks used to tell me.","Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.","Appa's right, Zuko.","In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.","Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.","Okay.","We've learned something about architecture.","Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too.","The past can be a great teacher.","Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.","There's probably a lot more.","Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.","Look, this seems promising.","Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending.","I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors.","Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years.","Something you're not telling me.","But I thought your uncle was ...","I don't know, good?","It's locked up!","Monkeyfeathers!","The solstice again?","We can't wait here that long.","Nothing's happening.","You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you.","You're pretty smart.","It says this is something called the Dancing Dragon.","Zuko, get over here!","I want you to dance with me!","Just do it.","Let's follow the steps of the statues.","Don't you see?","These aren't dance moves.","These statues are giving us a lesson.","I think this is some kind of Sun Warrior firebending form.","Hurray!","Wait, what exactly is that?","Well, don't touch it!","Remember what happened out there with those spikes?","I'm just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals.","Oh no, it's another trap!","I can't move!","Zuko, do something!","It stopped.","You ''had'' to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?","Help!","Well, what do you think we should do?","Please, I don't normally play this card, but ...","I'm the Avatar.","Just hear us out.","Ran and Shaw?","There are two of them?","I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.","It's like a little heartbeat.","I can't.","If I walk too fast, my flame will go out.","But what if I can't control it?","But once they find out I'm the Avatar ... We could turn back now.","We've already learned more about fire than we'd hoped.","What if they judge us, and attack us?","Give me some of yours.","I can't.","Quit being stingy!","Uh oh.","Still think we can take 'em?","Zuko, I think we're supposed to do the Dragon Dance with them.","Well, I think they want us to do something.","Let's just try it.","Wow.","Like firebending harmony.","So your uncle lied.","All this time, I thought firebending was destruction.","Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant.","But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life.","With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable.","I like jokes.","Nobody else has homework.","One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ...","Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.","What are you doing?","Zuko!","No!","I can't get him to go in there!","Appa hates tunnels!","We'll have to find a way!","We'll get through.","Let's go.","Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it?","Why?","Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?","Oh.","What's going on?","Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish?","Wait!","Stop!","I do understand.","You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage.","How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa?","How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?","I don't think so.","I think it's about getting revenge.","Katara, you sound like Jet.","The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper.","While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.","Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness.","No, it's not.","It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive.","So you were just gonna take Appa anyway?","It's okay, because I forgive you.","That give you any ideas?","I wasn't planning to.","This is a journey you need to take.","You need to face this man.","But when you do, please don't choose revenge.","Let your anger out, and then let it go.","Forgive him.","Thanks, Sokka.","I appreciate that.","Why do you need Momo?","Katara?","Are you okay?","Zuko told me what you did.","Or what you didn't do, I guess.","I'm proud of you.","You did the right thing.","Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing.","It never is.","I was just, I wanted to ... okay.","Wait, is that a woman playing me?","I don't do that!","That's not what I'm like!","And I'm ''not'' a woman!","Ugh.","Ugh!","At least the Sokka actor kind of looks like you.","That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all!","Argh!","Yeah, that's not you at all.","No, I'm not!","I hate this play!","Overreacting?","If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State right now!","Katara, did you really mean what you said in there?","On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me.","But it's true, isn't it?","We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together.","But we're not.","Why don't you know?","Well, when is the right time?","Ugh, I'm such an idiot!","I'll say.","I'm trying.","Ooh, ooh!","Me, me, me!","Check out my Appa sand sculpture.","Whoa!","Wow, you've even made a little Earth King and Bosco.","Is that a blubbering blob monster?","But it doesn't even look like- Aah!","What are you doing?","Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!","Enough!","About Sozin's Comet ...","I was actually gonna wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.","I'm not ready.","I need more time to master firebending.","What am I gonna do?","Why didn't you tell me about your dad's crazy plan sooner?","This is bad.","This is really, really bad.","Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together, but I wouldn't want to do it any other way.","That's like waterbending.","So, have ''you'' ever redirected lightning before?","What did it feel like?","Well, not ''over'' over.","I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action, am I right?","Oh.","Yeah, I'll just do that.","I can't.","I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right.","I didn't feel like myself.","But he's still a human being.","No, I agree with you.","Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way.","I don't know.","Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.","Do you really think that would work?","This goes against everything I learned from the monks.","I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like.","Just what, Katara?","What?","Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it!","Hey, Momo.","I don't suppose ''you'' know what I should do.","I didn't think so.","Hey, Momo.","I just had the strangest dream.","Wait.","Where are we?","Where are we, Momo?","Maybe I'm in the Spirit World?","But wait.","You can see me.","We could both be in the Spirit World.","Nope.","My bending works.","Maybe if we climb to the top of the island, we can figure out where we are.","It's a hexagon.","It doesn't seem like normal rock.","It's not made of earth.","This is so strange.","I wish I had some help right now.","I wish I had Roku.","I ''do'' have Roku!","So where am I, Roku?","What is this place?","I am.","I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord.","Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life, but I just don't know if I can do that.","Avatar Kyoshi.","I need your wisdom.","I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.","I need to look deep inside myself.","Avatar Yangchen, the monks always taught me that all life is sacred.","Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web.","I know, I'm even a vegetarian.","I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever.","And I've only had to use violence for necessary defense.","And I've certainly never used it to take a life.","But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free.","I guess I don't have a choice, Momo.","I have to kill the Fire Lord.","Wait.","Is it just me, or are those mountains getting bigger?","They're not getting larger, They're getting closer!","The whole island is moving!","It's amazing Momo!","The biggest animal in the world!","I've gotta to swim around and find its face.","A lion turtle!","Maybe you can help me.","Everyone, even my own past lives, are expecting me to end someone's life.","But I don't know if I can do it.","Momo, time for you to go.","''Please'' listen to me.","We don't have to fight.","You have the power to end it here and stop what you're doing.","I took away your firebending.","You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.","I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance.","I took his bending away.","A giant lion turtle.","And now we're friends.","I can't believe a year ago I was still frozen in a block of ice.","The world's so different

me know if they have something you can listen to.","What's up?","So ... you like ... flying?","Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground where I can see.","Well, I don't ''see'' the way you

I'd miss the taste of mud so much.","Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations.","Ahhh ...","Finally!","Solid ground!","I don't think this is a normal cave.","This was carved by something.","There's something buzzing in here.","Something that's coming for us!","Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air!","I recognize the son's voice.","He's the one that stole Appa.","I

help?","Here it comes!","You're crazy.","You been hitting the cactus juice again?","Back in the city.","Great.","It's just a bunch of walls and rules.","You wait, you'll get sick of it in a couple of days.","It's called \"being handled\".","Get used to it.","We don't ''need'' a babysitter.","I can feel you shaking.","How are we supposed to do that?","\"One doesn't just ''pop'' in on the Earth King!\"","Or his armadillo bear.","This place ... is weird.","Won't work.","Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd will spot you a mile away.","You've got no manners!","I learned proper society behavior and ''chose'' to leave it.","You never learned anything.","And frankly, it's a little too late.","Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys!","Don't talk to the commoners, Katara.","First rule of society.","I think this will do.","Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us!","I'm going to have to tell them ''who'' didn't let me in.","Another crab puff, please.","I'd know your little footsteps anywhere, Twinkle Toes.","He's your puppet!","I'm ready.","You call it dirt, I call it a healthy coating of earth!","Do I have to?!","The Fancy Lady Day Spa?","Sounds like my kinda place.","Sure, Katara, whatever you say.","As long as they don't touch my feet.","Well, that wasn't so bad.","I'm not usually into that stuff but I actually feel ... girly.","Thanks.","No, no, that ''was'' a good one.","Like your poodle monkey.","You know what else is a good one?","It's okay.","One of the good things about being blind, is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearance.","I don't care what I look like.","I'm not looking for anyone's approval.","I know who I am.","I am?","I'd return the compliment, but I've no idea how you look like.","Thank you, Katara.","No!","Stop sinking!","Don't make me put this down!","I'm sorry, Appa.","What makes you think we'll get it?","I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang.","I'm with Sweetness.","I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se.","And I can't even see!","I don't trust the new positive Sokka.","Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!?","Can we please buy a new saddle?","Riding bareback is terrifying!","What was that?","How should I know?","I'm still voting we ''leave'' Ba Sing Se.","He has a good point.","It's gone!","First time flying?","Yeah.","I hate it, too.","Long Feng intercepted our letters from home?","That's just sad.","I know what you mean.","My mom's in the

not!","It's the real deal!","I am the greatest earthbender in the world!","Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!","So how did it go with the guru?","Did you master the Avatar State?","There's no one else here.","Wait!","Someone's at the door.","Actually, I know who it is.","It's an old friend of mine.","Glad to see you're okay.","I met him in the woods once and knocked him down.","Then he

doing?","You make it too easy!","Hey, Aang!","We're going into town to find some dinner.","You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you?","Hey!","What's

taught them to be free.","Pah!","Plegh!","Too bad your skills aren't ''on'' the hook.","I don't feel anything.","Where is the village?","Hey, loud mouths!","Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about \"taking out the Fire Lord.\"","Finagle away, oh schedule master.","Well ''I'm'' not waking up early.","Forget it!","Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much.","He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.","Is it just me, or does this place seem different?","We need more food.","Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better.","What's going on?","Maybe we can clean the river!","Eh, you've seen nothing once, you've seen it a thousand times.","Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is that we don't get the hero worship anymore.","I

lifetime?","How could you do this to me?","You betrayed me!","Good job, Twinkle Toes.","Visualize, then attack.","What's the matter?","Can't handle a little dirt, Madame Fussy-Britches?","Hungry for a mud pie?","While Katara cleans up, let's go have some fun!","I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you.","We can get more money.","Right there.","This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage.","Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute.","But I can feel it with my earthbending.","How can I possibly play?","I'm blind.","More

you hate fun?","Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up?","Yeah!","Maybe!","Maybe then you'd see how great we have it!","I mean, look at us!","We're traveling around the world!","Making easy money!","Having fun!","With no parents to tell us what to do!","Whatever.","I ''do'' hate them.","I'll stop when I wanna stop and not when you tell me!","Well it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper.","A wanted poster!","That's so great!","\"The Runaway.\"","I love my new nickname.","Is there a picture of me?","Does it look good?","Don't be such a worrywart like your sister.","Think of it this way: Now you've got plenty of money to help with the invasion plan.","Here's a little extra, so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation.","You know what?","Make it an atlas.","Of course you do.","And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret.","Yes, we were.","No, I don't.","Yes.","Really.","I don't know!","I mean, seriously!","What is with you people?","I'm ''blind''!","Where did you get that!?","You went through my stuff!","You had no right!","That's a lie!","You're lying, Katara!","Oh really, Mom?","Or what are you gonna do?","Send me to my room?","Well you can't!","Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom!","No, but you certainly act like it!","You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not!","You're just a regular kid like the rest of us!","So stop acting like you can tell me what to do!","I can do whatever I want!","I can't be around you right now!","So lemme guess: You brought me out here to tell me that your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.","Yeah.","I don't know how you could deal with it.","I don't understand.","I guess I never thought about that.","The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing.","She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me.","You know, the real me.","That's more than my own mom.","Don't ever tell her I said any of this!","Katara, stop.","You don't need to apologize.","I was the one being stupid.","These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them.","What?","''You'' wanna pull a scam?","You ''know'' I'm in!","Now what's this idea of yours?","How could you do this to me?","You betrayed

at least fun to argue with.","It's okay.","I was really mad when you said that because ... well because, maybe it's true.","I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them.","I don't know.","I wish we had some earth or water.","We need bendables.","I left it back at camp.","I was worried they would take it.","Um, Katara?","Are you okay?","Well, what are you doing?","Katara!","You're a genius!","A sweaty, stinky genius!","Let's get out of here!","Good job, Sokka.","Now let's get outta here before Combustion Man catches us.","Katara?","I need your help.","I need you to write some things down for me.","I wanna send a letter to my parents.","What are you doing?","Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.","Wait!","Guys, did you hear that?","I hear people under the mountain.","And they're screaming.","No, I'm serious.","I hear something.","It just ... stopped.","Maybe it's treasure!","Ooh!","Hand it over!","I thought they were ocean kumquats.","Maybe the Moon Spirit just turned mean.","Where does Old Man Ding live?","Oh no!","I did hear people screaming under the mountain.","The missing villagers must still be there!","I can hear them.","They're this way!","This is the place.","That's why you have me.","Let's go!","I'll get these people out of here.","You go!","How did you pick this place?","Relax!","It's still two days before

you blame yourself for?","Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy.","If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive

cannot lie about your own nature.","You must accept that you are the Avatar.","Very good, Aang.","You have opened the chakra of truth.","The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the
