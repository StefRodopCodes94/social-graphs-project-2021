here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast.","Goodnight.","''Goodnight!''","Slow down, Katara.","When did this happen?","Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone.","I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work.","There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines.","All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here.","The boulder

better hide.","We don't have much time.","What are we gonna do?","Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?","For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock.","Something they can bend.","It should.","These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village.","We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale.","There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo.","And the whole system is ventilated.","Aang closed off all the vents except one.","When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go, right back here.","Stay back!","I'm warning you!","It's like a scar ...","Listen.","It's so quiet.","There's no life anywhere.","What?","I'm not allowed to be angry?","Cheered me up.","Ow.","Yeah, I probably deserved that.","Hey, who are you?","Why is it attacking you?","Yeah.","We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster.","This isn't right.","We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.","He still shouldn't have to face this alone.","It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying.","Maybe we should go help him.","That's it.","He needs help.","Hei Bai, over here!","We'll fight him together, Aang.","Aang!","Over here!","Help!","What happened?","Like I seriously need to use the bathroom.","You could give us some supplies, and some money.","What?","We need stuff.","What is it?","Creepy, but great.","At least, not without your friends.","We got your back.","Ew!","Yeah!","And it's gaining, fast!","Can't you make Appa go any faster?","Let's run this blockade!","We got into the Fire Nation.","Great.","No!","I'm good.","Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders!","Well ...","I was talking to Momo.","I don't see any guards.","Wait.","I think I heard something.","Do you know where you're going?","Firebenders aren't our friends!","Hey don't feel bad.","You're only a hundred years late!","Five fire blasts, huh?","I think I can help you out.","This is a little trick I picked up from my father.","I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, ta-da!","Fake firebending!","I don't get it.","That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.","Come on Aang.","Let her dream.","How are ''we'' gonna make it out of this?","We got your back.","Would you sit down?","If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off.","What's bugging you anyway?","Well, let's see.","You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years.","I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.","Nice puddle.","Great.","So what am I supposed to do?","So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet?","Okay.","Yeah, don't get too happy.","You've got to do ''me'' next.","Aang?!","Yeah, I'll say!","You just \"practiced\" our supplies down the river.","My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender.","We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us.","Let's spend it wisely.","It doesn't even work.","See?","Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.","Wait a minute ... Sea loving traders, with suspiciously acquired merchandise, and pet reptile birds?","You guys are pirates!","Yeah, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.","Whoa!","No wonder they were trying to hack us up!","You stole their waterbending scroll!","It doesn't matter.","You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes.","Whatever.","Ha, ha, ha!","What about Momo?","He's the real victim here.","Huh?","Where did she go?","I don't believe it.","She took the scroll!","She's obsessed with that thing.","It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep- Oh, what?","I'm not good enough to kidnap?","Ah!","You're really gonna hand over ''the Avatar'' for a stupid piece of parchment?","Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll.","I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense.","Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar.","You guys would be set for life.","Aang, are you there?","Where?","I can't find you!","We'd need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.","I don't know how.","This thing wasn't made by the Water Tribe!","Would you two quit congratulating each other and help me out?","Have you lost your mind?","This is no time for flute practice!","But we have another problem.","Yeah, we owe you one.","Is that really how you feel?","First, what did you learn?","Right, got it ... Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not.","Besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.","What if it doesn't?","Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing.","Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry.","Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job- Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs.","Whatever.","Okay, I've seen enough.","Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.","Calm down, we know you're next.","Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business.","Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?","His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isn't it?","We gotta help him!","Okay, now we gotta help ''me''!","I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers.","So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?","Exactly!","Finally, someone gets it!","Would I!","Hm-hmm.","Hmm.","That's just terrible.","You gonna finish that?","Yeah Katara, what are you talking about?","Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.","We barely survived one!","Me too.","I only took their side 'cause they fed me.","That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.","What?","What's going on?","Did we get captured again?","Don't have to tell me twice.","Guys, wait.","This was in my dream.","We shouldn't go to the market.","Out of food and out of money.","Now what are we supposed to do?","Are you kidding?","Shelter from ''what''?","I'll go.","What?","You said get a job ... and he's ''paying double''.","I said I was going to do this job.","I can't back out just because of some bad weather.","Hey!","They left without saying good-bye!","I know!","This one time, I was ...","I'm too young to die!","Seriously, you're still going to pay me, right?","Do you hear that?","It stopped raining.","You know what I love about Appa the most?","His sense of humor.","Classic Appa.","Take that, you rock!","Ha, ha!","You guys are killing me!","Katara, please, water.","Water ... Who's this \"Aang\" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?","Mmmm!","This is tasty!","Mmm!","He is taunting us!","You are so going to be dinner!","Hey, where's the fishing line?","Aw, it's all tangled!","Great, Aang.","Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business.","Stop taunting me!","Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love!","No, play dead!","He'll lose interest!","No, punch him in the bill!","Mmm, lunch!","Lucky for you, we came along.","Oh, come on.","Fortune telling is nonsense!","No, it doesn't!","You can't ''really'' tell the future!","Of course she predicted it was going to rain.","The sky's been gray all day!","Look, I'm going to predict the future now.","It's going to keep drizzling.","See?","Agh!","I'll try a curd puff.","Don't be modest!","They're huge!","I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.","It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.","Boring stuff I'm sure.","Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have.","Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.","I don't even want to know!","Okay, let's get this over with.","But you didn't read my palms or anything!","Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax.","That woman is crazy!","My life will calm and happy and joyful!","That doesn't prove ''anything''!","Do you even hear yourself?","I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition!","I can't believe all these saps!","Someone really needs to scream some sense into them.","Not for long.","I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.","Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?","Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?","I don't care what Aunt Wu told you!","You have to take a bath sometime!","''Some'' stuff?","You've come to the right place.","What can I do you for?","I think I know who you mean.","Of course I am.","And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.","Oh yeah, she's crazy about you.","All you have to do now is not mess it up.","The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.","Yep.","If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.","Wow, that kid is good.","I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower.","Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.","What?","Don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too.","Those people all think they're safe!","We've got to warn them!","Well, we have other things to worry about.","Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.","Everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second!","Aunt Wu was wrong!","Look!","Can your fortune telling explain that?","I know that's the problem.","Aunt Wu, look!","Something is happening in the clouds.","Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot.","If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.","Everybody else grab a shovel Come on!","We've gotta hurry!","Dig faster!","Dig faster!","Man, sometimes I forget what a powerful bender that kid is.","Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.","No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling.","I hate you.","Let me see that.","This is a Water Tribe weapon.","See if you can find anything else.","It's burned.","There was a battle!","Water Tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.","The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill.","I don't know.","The trail ends here.","It's one of our boats!","No, but it's from his fleet.","Dad was here.","I'm coming with you.","I'm strong, I'm brave, I can fight!","Please, Dad!","I don't understand.","Who's there?","Bato?","Where's Dad?","What smells so good, Bato?","Perfume?","Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much.","Am I right?","Everything's here, even the pelts!","Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things!","So, who was it that came up with the Great Blubber Fiasco?","It's a long one Aang, some other time.","Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?","When?","It's been over two years since we've seen Dad.","That would be so incredible!","Katara!","It would be great, but we can't.","We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.","Is this the boat he took you ice dodging in?","How are we supposed to ice dodge without ice?","Aang, ease up on the jib.","Katara, steady.","Aang, less sail.","Katara, give him room.","Aang, helm to lee.","Helm to lee!","Great job!","We can make it.","Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail.","Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks.","Now!","This is the map to our father!","You had it the whole time?","How could you?","Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own.","I'm going to find Dad.","Katara, are you with me?","It's probably wounded.","We need to go back.","I wanna see Dad, but, helping Aang is where we're needed the most.","Thanks, Bato.","We split up.","He's long gone.","Pretty stupid.","Run!","I'm ... starting to get some feeling back!","Ow.","That thing sees with its nose.","Let's give him something to look at.","Yeah, we've lost too much time as it is.","Of course we do, Aang.","But, you're our family, too.","And right now, you need us more.","I wonder why they left this boat?","There's nothing wrong with it.","I don't want to talk about it.","See if you can find a menu, I'm starving!","A wanted poster!","This is bad.","It's like you're a whole different person ... Where are we gonna get masks like that?","That was surprisingly easy.","Finally!","What do you have?","I'll take'em!","Aaahhh!","Hot!","Hot!","Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.","What do you think you're doing?","No, we don't want to make a scene!","I think it's time to go.","I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!","You really know your explosives ... You're a Fire Nation Soldier!","He was very highly ranked, we get it.","We're ''not'' gonna go find some ''crazy'' firebender!","Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the North Pole in the morning.","That's what you said about going to the festival!","Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?","Hold on, you know these guys?","Finally!","Let's hit the road.","''Hey''!","Katara, what's wrong?","What did you do?!","I told you we shouldn't mess around with this!","Look what you did!","''You burned my sister''!","You burned my sister!","This is all your fault!","Katara!","Are you all right?","Aang, come on!","Let's go!","He disappeared.","They all did.","When did you learn that?","Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years.","Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble.","Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!","Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me!","Thanks for healing that up.","That was great.","Really helpful.","Sorry ... You want me to be like you, or totally honest?","I'm saying you're an optimist.","Same thing, basically.","What do you mean \"they're not\"?","Those guys are flying!","We better find some solid ground, before it finds us.","Wow!","This glider chair is incredible!","Wow!","So better!","Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing?","The notches all look the same.","You put spark powder in the candle!","Aaah!","These lanterns are terrible.","I can't see!","Why would you want to use fireflies for light?","Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.","So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen.","Ugh!","Week old egg smell!","How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!?","Yeah ... if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ... Then, if there's a leak ... And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!","You make weapons for the Fire Nation?!","Very bad!","Thank you.","You're a genius!","See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, but once it did, it just kept going.","You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape.","So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?","A lid is actually the answer.","If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.","Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs: smoke, slime, fire, and ... Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?","Then I guess they won't see this coming.","Oh no, that was the last one.","Rotten eggs!","There!","That's were the gas is escaping.","It's the only bomb we've got.","We're going down!","Get ready!","Aang you were right about air power.","As long as we've got the skies, we'll have the Fire Nation on the run.","We're finally here.","Yeah ... she is ... Hi there.","Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.","So ... uhhh ... you're a princess, huh?","You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself.","A lot of things!","Do you mind?","I'm trying to have a conversation here.","So, it looks like I'm going to be in town for a while.","I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together?","Princess Yue, good morning!","How about that picnic last night?","Boy, your dad sure does know how to throw a party.","Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.","So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.","Yes ... at a place ... for some time.","That's okay, it was worth it.","See you tonight.","Hi, Princess Yue.","I made you something.","I carved it myself.","Actually, it's supposed to be a fish.","See, it has a fin.","No, it's Princess Yue.","I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost.","So, how's waterbending training?","Why don't you just teach her, Aang?","I'm not happy.","Yeah, I think she did.","Are you crazy, Katara?","You're not going to win this fight!","Nothing.","I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.","No, no.","See, that's the thing.","I think I do understand now.","You're a Princess, and I'm ...","I'm just a Southern peasant.","It's okay.","You don't have to say anything.","I'll see you around, okay?","Okay, now I'm really confused.","''Happy'', but confused.","Are you kidding?","I grew up in a block of ice.","It's not exactly a cultural hub.","What's wrong?","We're taking a walk!","I know what you need.","You need to meet my good friend, Appa.","Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy?","Ah, ah, easy!","Down boy!","Agh!","No, up!","Yeah, we pretty much live up here.","Not when you're with someone.","Yeah ...","Woo, yeah!","Ahhh, good times, good times.","Hey, look!","Oh no ... Soot.","I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked.","It's soot mixed with snow.","It's the Fire Nation.","They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff, I'd say there's a lot of them.","What's wrong?","We have to go!","What?","We're just friends.","You don't love him, do you?","You don't even seem to like him.","You're not marrying ''them.''","Count me in!","Katara!","Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.","When, like, a hundred years ago?","The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore.","The newer uniforms are more streamlined.","His name is Zhao.","Middle-aged, big sideburns, bigger temper ...","Nothing.","Congratulations.","Perks?","What does ''that'' mean?","Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!","It's Admiral ''Zhao''!","Oh, no.","Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang.","Everything's fine.","What, you want me to scrub the barracks?","Oh ... Sure.","That ... shouldn't be too hard.","What happened?","Where's Zuko?","Where did they go ... You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back.","Zuko can't have gotten far.","We'll find him.","Aang's gonna be fine.","Yip, yip.","They're not going to die in this blizzard.","If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up.","They'll survive, and we'll find them.","Hey, this is some quality rope!","Sure we can.","Let's go.","Yeah, this makes a lot of sense.","Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.","Are you okay?","What do you mean?","No!","You don't have to do that.","I won't let you!","Your father told me to protect you.","No!","She's gone, she's gone.","You must be proud.","There it is!","Not bad, not bad.","But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar State.","Why not?","Remember when he took out the Fire Navy?","He was incredible!","Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord!","I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death.","Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar State.","Huh?","You sure?","Okay.","What can he say?","You're the Avatar.","Who knows better than you?","Aang!","The general's gone crazy!","He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar State!","Good ... bird ... horse thingy ... Katara!","No!","Anybody got a problem with that?","You guys are going to be done soon, right?","We have a lot of ground to cover if we're going to make it to Omashu today.","I could be ready in two minutes.","Seriously, whenever.","Who are you?","Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me.","We need to get to Omashu.","No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows.","O. Ma.","Shu!","I think we'll just stick with flying.","We've dealt with the Fire Nation before.","We'll be fine.","Secret love cave, let's go.","How far are we from the tunnel?","Curse!","What exactly is this curse?","That's it!","There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!","It's Fire Nation.","They're tracking us.","We will be fine.","All we need is a plan.","Chong, how long do those torches last?","It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!","I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been.","Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.","This doesn't make sense.","We already came through this way.","There's something strange here.","There's only one explanation.","The tunnels are changing.","Right, if only we listened to you.","Nooooo!","At least I'm ''thinking'' of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku.","No, they were trying to get away from something!","Badgermoles coming toward me.","Come on guys, help me out!","How did you guys get out?","Really?","We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way.","Just play your songs.","The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about: the destination.","I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O- Oh no ... Up until now it was.","Now Ba Sing Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.","Aang, stop.","We don't even know if Bumi's still ... A-around.","A secret passage?","Why didn't we just use this last time?","Ugh!","Eww!","Ahh!","They won't let go!","Help!","Oh, it's so awful.","I'm dying.","Where would they be keeping him?","Suckers!","You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.","The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta act sick too.","Ya gotta sell it!","Now that's what I'm talkin' about.","Okay everyone!","Into sick formation.","No!","Bad Fire Nation baby!","Oh ... all right.","You realize we're probably walking right into a trap.","Way ahead of ya!","I seem to manage!","We can catch him!","Hey, you taking us down for a reason?","Aang, why are we going down?","Are you noticing now?","Is it telling you where we can get something to eat?","No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.","Yes.","See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here.","You better throw in an extra \"yip\"!","We gotta move!","Where?","Where?","Why do things keep attaching to me?!","We better speed things up.","Aang, these are just plants.","Do you want me to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" as I swing my machete back and forth?","I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can.","There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them.","We'll have to make camp for the night.","Nothing, just swamp gas.","Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.","I think we should build a fire.","No, I asked the swamp.","It said this was fine.","Right, swamp?","\"No problem, Sokka!\"","Please, we're all alone out here.","Right, except for them.","Aang!","Stupid swamp!","Dumb, ugly vines!","Katara!","You think you're so tough, huh?","Hello?","Yue?","This is just a trick of the light ... swamp gas ...","I ... hit my head running away last night.","I'm going crazy.","What do you guys think you're doing!?","I've been looking all over for you!","Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!","Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us.","That's why we all saw things out here.","I thought I saw Yue.","But, that doesn't prove anything.","Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.","It's just a tree.","It can't call anyone.","For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here.","There's someone in there!","He's bending the vines!","He's the Avatar.","Stuff like that happens to us a lot.","See, completely reasonable.","Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home.","Nothing mystical about it.","Sure you did.","It seems real chatty.","Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to find Appa and Momo.","Huu?","Tastes just like arctic hen.","So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa?","You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.","Nice Slim!","Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here.","Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp.","I told you, we were hungry.","I'm eating a giant bug!","That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count.","The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down.","Well, no accounting for weather.","Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp.","What are you doing in my mouth?","Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.","Come on!","Come on!","Come on!","Wait, my boomerang!","Oh, I see, so there's time to get your scrolls and time to get your staff, but no time for my boomerang?","Oh.","I feel like I've lost part of my identity.","Imagine if you lost your arrow, or Katara lost her ... hair loopies.","I used to be boomerang guy ... And here comes Avatar Roku!","And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food!","Now a torch, that's a nice prop.","It's bright, dangerous ... smells manly.","But I'm not sure I could carry it off.","So some people don't like you, big deal!","There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you.","Now let's bust you out of here!","Sure you can!","A little swish-swish-swish!","Airbending slice!","And we're on our way!","How're we gonna to do that?","The crime happened over three hundred years ago.","Well, I guess I could be classified as such.","Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots!","See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks.","Okay, I guess I am pretty good.","Fine!","But I'm going to need some new props.","I'm ready.","What?","This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone.","And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.","Shhh!","I wanna solve it!","That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple!","You're right.","We need to go to Kyoshi Island.","They say it was Kyoshi.","So, uh ... what's Suki up to?","Is she around?","Oh, well ... that's great.","These fans ...","They were her weapons, no?","Special outfit?","Hat and pipe?","These things mean anything to you?","Aha!","There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint.","And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene.","Three hundred and seventy years?","Wait, are you sure it was today?","This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise.","It took place at sun''set''.","Look at the shadows.","If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime.","She has an alibi!","You can do it, Aang.","Just remember the evidence.","The footprint!","He's dead.","What are you doing?","I do believe in the power of stuff.","Boomerang!","You do always come back!","What is this?","This is by far the worst town we've ever been to.","It's pricey ... but I really do like it.","I do, don't I?","But no, it's too expensive.","I shouldn't.","You know what?","I'm gonna get it.","Oh, I got to remember that one!","What was I thinking?","I don't need a new bag!","Why did you let me buy this?","I guess that's why.","That's what I paid for.","Go back to the Fire Nation!","Yeah!","Wooo!","The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt!","Yeah!","Woohoo!","Go Aang!","Avenge The Boulder!","Boo!","No talking!","Way to go, champ!","I've got to admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag.","It matches the belt, perfectly.","Nicely done.","Water Tribe.","Don't answer to Twinkle Toes, it's not manly!","Look, we all have to do our part to win this war, and yours is to teach Aang earthbending.","Whoever took Aang and Toph left this.","Here's your money.","Now let them go.","I'm trying!","Well, we'd better get out of here, before your dad changes his mind again.","Sorry.","That's not grass.","Appa's shedding.","It's not that bad, Katara.","It makes a great wig!","Your powers of perception are frightening.","Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.","Okay, forget about setting up camp.","I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.","Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.","This is a warrior's wolf tail.","Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh?","No Momo, shhh.","Sleepy time.","Oh, don't tell me ...","Always the optimist ... Actually Toph, there's four of us.","I can still fight!","Errrgh!","Oh no, the sun is rising.","We've been up all night with no sleep!","Yes ... sleep.","Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them.","The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.","Wait!","Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.","No problem.","Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?","Toph couldn't have made it too far.","What is it, Momo?","Ooooh, no!","Katara!","Appa, come on, we need to go faster!","We made it!","We're safe.","Good try, but no.","How are you doing?","Thanks Appa, I don't know what we'd do without you.","Rock beats airbender!","You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat.","Just a bit closer ... Gotcha!","You are one lucky little meat creature.","You probably think I deserve this, don't you?","Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things.","Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal.","But this time it didn't work out that way.","I admit it ... you're cute.","Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me.","No meat.","Even though meat is so tasty.","Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off!","That's okay, I got it.","Now, come back boomerang.","Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff.","If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm.","Okay?","Ow!","That's all I got.","It's pretty much my whole identity.","Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy.","But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow.","Deal?","Aang!","Thank goodness!","Have you got any meat?","Aggh, stop, stop!","You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!","Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here.","How about it?","Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.","You can't?","Why not?","Uncomfortable?","Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ...","Awkward position, I think I know the feeling.","Hmmm ... how about that.","Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops.","Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.","Really?","He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion.","Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here!","This is really bad!","Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!","Please, don't leave me again.","What are you doing here?","Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment.","So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?","Yeah, no crushing, please.","What's out here?","Orchestra, huh?","Well, la-di-da.","This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about?","We should be making plans.","There's no time for vacations.","Even if you do master all of the elements, then what?","It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation.","Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house?","Knock, knock.","Hello, Fire Lord?","Anybody home?","I don't think so.","We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war.","I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy.","Excuse me.","So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy.","Do you have a more current map?","Ours seems to be a little dated.","What, no Fire Nation?","Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?","Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?","If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation?","A map, maybe?","Then it's settled.","Aang, I do believe it's my turn.","I'd like to spend my vacation at the library!","You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.","Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?","Down there, what's that?","What kind of animal is that?","No, this is the library- look!","It's completely buried.","That fox thingy went in through a window.","I say we climb up there and give it a look.","Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?","What?","No-no-no-no destroying.","We're not into that.","Um ... knowledge for knowledge's sake?","I'm not lying, I'm here with the Avatar, and he's the bridge between our worlds.","He'll vouch for me.","Oh, great spirit, check this out.","Ta-da!","It's a special knot.","That counts as knowledge!","Bright enough to fool you.","Eh, I've seen weirder.","\"The darkest day in Fire Nation history.\"","It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else.","I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day.","This could be promising.","The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here.","That's so unfair!","Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago.","I need to know what happened on the darkest day.","Hello, little weird fox guy.","Um, sure, I guess I'll follow you.","Uh, this is beautiful, but how is it helpful?","Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.","It's not broken.","The sun is behind the moon.","It's a solar eclipse!","It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history.","Now I get it.","Something awful happened on that day.","I don't know what, but I do know why.","Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse.","Sorry.","Fine, you earned it.","We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se.","We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless.","The Fire Lord is going down!","You don't understand.","If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation.","You saw what they did to your library.","They're destructive and dangerous.","We need this information.","But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna to happen.","No, we won't.","If we leave this place, we'll never get the information.","Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover.","Katara, take Momo and get out of here!","Go!","Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be.","I don't have to.","We just need to check every date before Sozin's Comet arrives.","Because after that- well, try not to think about that.","That's it!","The solar eclipse!","It's just a few months away.","Got it.","Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.","That's called Sokka style.","Learn it.","Wait!","Professor, let's go.","We got it.","There's a solar eclipse coming.","The Fire Nation's in trouble now!","Who's going to save our lives now?","We'll never make it out of here.","You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?","Can't you watch where you're ...","Right.","Sorry.","If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.","We're drinking your bending water.","You used this on the swamp guy!","Urch!","Not anymore!","Look!","There's water trapped inside these!","Suit yourself.","It's very thirst quenching though.","Drink cactus juice.","It'll quench ya!","Nothing's quenchier.","It's the quenchiest!","Who lit Toph on fire?","How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?","It's a giant mushroom!","Maybe it's friendly!","Friendly mushroom!","Mushy giant friend!","Why don't we ask the circle birds?","Momo, no!","You've killed us all!","Oh, right.","Bending.","What?!","I didn't steal anything!","Who told you that?","It was you!","You ratted me out!","Take it easy little lady.","I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.","I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice.","And look!","Tastes like rotten penguin meat!","Awww, I feel woozy.","I have a natural curiosity.","What are you doing?","That rock almost crushed me!","I got this one.","I guess my head's not as clear as I thought.","Just get out of here!","Run!","Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library.","Just splash some water on 'em.","Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here.","And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here.","It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.","It's the only way.","I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.","Then to Ba Sing Se we go.","No more distractions.","Well, we are desperate.","Don't you know who this is?","He's the Avatar!","All right, we scammed that lady good!","Is there a problem?","Do I know you?","Suki!","Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then.","Nothing major.","I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.","Are you sure that's a good idea?","Nothing.","I'm glad you're coming.","This is the Serpent's Pass?","I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent.","Huh, I guess they misnamed it.","They've spotted us!","Let's go, let's go!","Suki, are you okay?","You have to be more careful!","Come on!","Suki, you shouldn't sleep there.","Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give away at any moment!","You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself!","Wait!","Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine.","Yeah, it really is.","I know you can.","It's so hard to lose someone you care about.","Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone.","I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.","Who is this guy?","Is he taller than me?","Is he better-looking?","Oh!","I can't.","No, you shouldn't be.","I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass!","Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!","Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering.","Thank you.","Toph, come on, it's just ice!","You're doing great!","Just follow the sound of my voice!","You're almost there!","I'm coming, Toph!","There's the wall!","Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.","What's wrong?","What?","Now?","Can't you hold it in or something?","This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal!","This is a real ... human ... thing!","No, no, I'm good this time.","It's so ... squishy looking.","See you in the big city.","Whoa, hold on.","Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?","So you came along to protect me?","You talk too much.","Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?","That's a good group name.","Very catchy.","Get a hold of yourself, man!","Why are you all looking at me?","So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan?","That's a lot of pressure.","That part I don't mind.","Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!","Ooh!","What you just said!","That's how we're going to take down the drill!","The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders!","It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing!","Sorry.","There!","Toph, come on!","Okay, good luck!","I need a plan of this machine.","Some schematics that show what the inside looks like.","Then we can find its weak points.","That's the point.","I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it.","And when something breaks ...","This'll work.","Thanks!","It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures.","There's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell.","The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces.","If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.","Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans.","We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.","Look, I'm the plan guy.","You two are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys.","Together, we're Team Avatar!","C'mon team.","Don't quit now.","We're ...","I mean, you're almost there.","Do you hear that?","We took it down!","We better get out of here fast!","C'mon brace ... budge!","We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!","And boom!","It all comes crashing down!","The whole world minus the Fire Nation that is.","Good work, Team Avatar!","Now Aang just needs to ... duck!","Hey.","It's rock and water mixed together.","It means our way out!","Katara, keep that up.","The pressure will build up in the drill.","Then when Aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop!","Good technique, little sister!","Keep it up!","Don't forget to breathe!","Just bend the slurry, woman!","Woohoo!","I just want to say, good effort out there today, Team Avatar!","How about ... the Boomeraang Squad!","See it's good because it's got \"Aang\" in it.","Boomer''aang''.","The Aang Gang?","The Fearsome Foursome?","Why?","We're fearsome!","Hey, don't jinx it!","We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon.","Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!","I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.","He's a giant bison!","Where could someone possibly hide him?","Oh.","What's the problem?","It's amazing!","Yes.","We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King, immediately.","Ugh!","Maybe you missed what I said.","We need to talk to the king about the War, it's important.","Yeah, we met a professor from the Ba Sing Se University.","He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is ''absolutely crucial for the Earth King to hear''!","Is that woman deaf?","She only seems to hear every other word I say.","And who're the mean-looking guys in robes?","A month?","I think we would enjoy it more if we weren't staying for so long.","Can't we see the Earth King ''any'' sooner?","Where's the black market?","Who runs it?","Come on, you know!","''Right''.","And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?","Hey, come with me.","So, Pong, what's goin' on with this city?","Why is everyone here so scared here to talk about the war?","Certainly you mean his pet skunk bear.","Aha, but you learned it!","You could teach us!","Avatar Aang, how do you do?","Go on.","But I feel so fancy!","Fire!","Look, I came up with a back-up plan.","We dress Momo like a ghost, okay?","He flies by the guards, creating a distraction.","Then, we blast a hole in the wall- Okay ...","But remember that Momo ghost plan.","I think it's a winner.","Forget about them!","Just keep an eye out for the king.","You know, ''royal'', flowing robe, fancy jewelry.","Thanks for letting us in!","''What'' guy?","Not until we see the king.","You keep their attention while I look for the king.","Aang!","The Earth King!","Hey, let me go!","Why won't you let us talk to the king?","We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!","But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless.","You could lead an invasion ... What's this?","Ahh, poetry.","I am so sorry.","Something struck me in the rear.","I just ... wound up ... here.","They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe.","I am not an oaf.","You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard.","I calls it easy.","Like I paddle my canoe, I'll paddle yours too!","Squish, squash, sling that slang.","I'm always right back at ya, like my ... boomerang!","That's right, I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an \"okka\", young ladies, I rocked ya!","Poetry ... Look, we escaped from the Dai Li.","We got Appa back.","I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan.","We're on a roll.","We can build on it.","If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we'll need the Earth King's support.","I know, but I've got a good feeling about this.","This time will be different.","See?","Aang's with me.","It's the whole reason we came here in the first place.","We have to try.","That's probably the Dai Li searching for us.","So?","There it is!","That whole thing is the palace!","The Earth King's chamber should be in the center!","Why would you assume that?","If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and- Aahh!","Surface-to-air rocks!","More incoming!","Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side!","Sorry.","In there!","Toph, which way to the Earth King?","Sorry.","Wrong door.","Now that's an impressive door.","It's gotta go somewhere.","Yaaah!","A little warning next time?","No, we're on your side.","We're here to help.","But we dropped our weapons.","We're your allies.","Uh, no.","Him.","Wait!","I can prove he's lying.","Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison.","Ask him to lift his robe.","Never met a sky bison, huh?","Of course there is!","Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness.","To the Dai Li's secret headquarters.","You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.","Oh don't tell me- !","That's okay.","Still got my positive attitude.","Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.","If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa.","It's a drill.","A giant drill made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls.","Looks like Long Feng is long gone!","Ha!","Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one.","That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness: because we think you can help us end the war.","But there is hope.","Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity: A solar eclipse is coming.","The sun will be completely blocked out by the moon, and the firebenders will be helpless.","That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation.","The Day of Black Sun.","You're already vulnerable.","The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls.","You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance.","Oh.","What?","That could be Dad!","What's a guru?","Some kind of poisonous blow fish?","This is all such big news!","Where do we even start?","Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion.","I guess that's me.","You are the nicest ... sister ... ever!","All right.","Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip?","That's Suki!","Oh yeah.","The Kyoshi Warriors are a skilled group of fighters.","Trustworthy too.","They're good friends of ours.","Aahh!","Great.","That's enough.","Okay, we love each other.","Seriously.","You see, Aang?","A little positive thinking works wonders.","We got the king on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.","Everything is gonna work out perfectly.","From now on and forever.","I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach.","So what about you?","Are you nervous to meet this guru?","Hi, Dad.","Destructive?","Buoyant?","And ... Aggh, ehhh!","Terrible smelling!","Good one, Dad!","Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad?","You don't know how much this means to me, Dad.","I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am.","Really?","This can't be good news.","So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?","It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.","What is that?","Need a ride?","Aang, are you okay?","See, Aang?","She's with Suki.","They're probably back at our apartment right now talking about make-up or something.","Oh, no!","Whoa there!","You lost me at \"Zuko\".","\"Good inside him\" isn't enough!","Why don't you come back when it's ''outside'' him too, okay?","My sister!","Where are they keeping Katara?","We should split up.","Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk, no offense.","And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup.","There's General How!","The coup is happening right now!","We've gotta warn the Earth King!","Thank goodness we're in time!","Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.","Nope, all clear.","Let's go.","After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety.","We flew back to Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men.","The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone.","Well, not completely alone.","Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships.","Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise.","Since then we've been traveling west.","We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago.","We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us.","So we're planning a smaller invasion.","Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom.","We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.","And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage!","We have a secret... You!","Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead!","Isn't that great?","No, it's great!","It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore!","And even better, they won't be expecting you on the Day of Black Sun!","Aang, no!","You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret!","Just let us handle this.","Things couldn't get much worse.","The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?","Thank you, the universe!","Here, tie this around your head.","It will cover your arrow.","Aang, come on.","Be practical.","We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse.","Sh!","Keep quiet!","Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut.","Hey, we're in enemy territory.","Those are enemy birds.","Well, this is it.","This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins.","Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ... Looks like we got outvoted, sport.","Let's get some new clothes.","Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat.","Even the meat!","After ''what''?!","Enrolled in ''what''?!","Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible.","Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous.","Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days.","Flamey-O?","Fire.","Wang Fire.","This is my wife, Sapphire.","Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster.","I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce!","Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!","That settles it!","No more school for you, young man!","What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?","Go to your room!","I can't believe we're having a dance party.","It seems so ... silly.","Wow, they look pretty good together.","Oh, no I can't.","It's permanently glued to my skin.","Flamey-O sir, flamey-O.","Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook!","Get it?","Like a fishing hook?","Hmmm ...","It's doable.","But that means only two potty breaks today.","It's in the middle of the river!","No, we can't waste our time here.","We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on.","These people are on their own.","I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic.","We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into.","We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord.","Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this.","You know our mission has to come first.","Hey, Dock.","You work here too?","We'll just take the fish.","Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore?","Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule.","It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track.","Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day.","Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse, which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes.","And we just lost a whole day.","So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!","Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.","I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.","Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient.","Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning.","What?","Appa's sick?","That's awful!","Of course I care.","I might as well just throw our schedule away now.","And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well.","Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?","See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them.","All we need is medicine for our sick friend.","I guess you're right.","You got any more food to sell?","Two-headed!","What?","You get more for your money that way!","Hi, Dock.","Is Xu around?","And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along.","Well, I hope she returns every night.","Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was.","Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves.","If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory.","Oh, really?","A morning walk?","I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him purpleising tongue berries!","Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy.","We're leaving right now!","And how long did you know about this?","What did you do?","You ''what''?","I was joking!","I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises!","Did you even think this through?","The army is gonna blame the villagers!","They're headed there right now to get revenge!","Leave!","Do nothing!","Wait!","I'm coming, too.","You need me, and I will never turn my back on you.","Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you.","Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone.","You should be down on your knees thanking her!","You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?","Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are.","Oh man, you've ''never ''not seen anything like this.","What should I do?","Right.","Staying clear, got it.","Boo-hoo, poor heroes.","It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and making other stuff fly around.","I can't fly around, okay?","I can't ''do'' anything.","Look, I appreciate the effort, but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special and I'm ... not.","I'm just the guy in the group who's regular.","You do?","Shopping!","Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling.","Hey, how about these?","Ooh!","''That's'' what Sokka's talking about.","A sword?","It would be nice to be a master sword fighter.","All right, I'll talk to him.","I've come to train with the master.","Well, uhh ... Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.","Oh, uh, really, uh where I come from, the Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name... for Fire Nation colonials.","Well, actually, I've been all over the world.","And I know one thing for sure: I have a lot to learn.","I know.","Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth.","But the truth is...","I don't know if I am worthy.","Like a second head.","I am?","I am!","So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?","I'm finished!","Hm, manipulate them to my advantage ... oh!","Thanks.","That warms my heart.","Anyway, I need some help.","I'm sorry, Master.","You're wrong.","I am not worthy.","I'm not who you think I am.","I'm not from the Fire Nation.","I'm from the Southern Water Tribe.","I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you.","I'm sorry.","No, this is my fight, alone.","It's a Pai Sho tile.","I have no idea.","Ooh, that reminds me!","Toph, I thought you might like this since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before.","This is crazy!","How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?","As a matter of fact, they do not.","Then what ''was'' the point?","Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ...","Sneak Attack!","Yes!","Look at all those messenger hawks!","You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself.","That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone.","I could just send them messages.","She used earthbending to win the game!","Classic!","Speaking of that \"third-eyed freak\", I think I've come up with a name for him.","What do you think of \"Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man\"?","Just think about it.","Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some.","See you guys later.","Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar.","My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting.","Good little messenger hawky.","Who's got pretty feathers?","You're right, Hawky.","This is bad.","Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like.","It's a wanted poster.","Of you.","They've nicknamed you the Runaway.","Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good.","But, Toph, you're missing the point.","Maybe Katara was right.","These scams are drawing too much attention to us.","Well, that is true.","I had this idea of making armor for Appa.","I do like expensive atlases.","Not just a bird, a messenger bird.","Now we can send messages all over the world.","Even to Gran Gran.","Hm.","Uh, I never actually thought about that.","Hawky, Gran Gran, South Pole.","I think he gets it.","Hawky!","Make nice!","Bad Hawky!","Hey.","I'm staying out of this one.","I know, Hawky.","Why can't they just get along?","Hey, Aang.","You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me?","I've got an idea.","I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize.","Then everyone will be friends again.","It's a gift.","\"Dear Katara, sorry for everything.","Your friend, Toph.\"","Yup.","We're idiots.","I think we're gonna run into a similar problem.","Sorry, Hawky.","Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help.","Come on.","We need to talk.","Nah, she's pretty much a pain.","She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ... Actually, in a way, I rely on it.","When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life.","Our family was a mess, but Katara?","She had so much strength.","She stepped up and took on so much responsibility.","She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.","I'm gonna tell you something crazy.","I never told anyone this before, but honestly?","I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like.","It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me.","She's always been the one that's there.","And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture.","Hey, my lips are sealed.","I was just wondering the same thing.","We'd better check it out.","You two behave.","Appa's in charge.","Where do you think they might be?","You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.","This guy is too good!","He shoots fire from his brain!","Hey, I got it!","The perfect name for that guy: \"Combustion Man!\"","See?","It fits so well!","Well, I'm exhausted.","Hawky, how about you, buddy?","Yeah.","You're such a lazy little bird.","Hey, where'd Hawky go?","Is this one of those \"a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to\" stories?","Where'd she go?","Pfft!","Nice try.","Yes, please.","What do you mean \"disappearing\"?","I know, Momo.","This place is creepy!","I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep!","People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons?","This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans.","And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!","This is a mysterious little town you have here.","That Hama seems a little strange.","Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.","But what did she mean by that comment, \"mysterious children\"?","I'm gonna take a look around.","It'll be fine.","I'm not finished yet.","Come on ... Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh?","Well then why does she have a locked door up here?","We'll see.","It's empty, except for a little chest.","I have to see what's in there.","Maybe there's a key here somewhere ... Come on, come on!","Suit yourself!","Do it, Toph!","An old comb?","But why didn't you tell us?","And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right.","But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.","So how did you end up out here?","How did you get away?","And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?","The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady.","She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!","We wanted to ask you about that.","Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?","I can't see anything down there.","A witch?","What do you mean?","Hama!","I knew there was something creepy about her!","We know what you've been doing, Hama!","Katara, look out!","It's like my brain has a mind of its own!","Stop it arm, stop it!","This is it!","The official rendezvous point for the invasion force.","Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map.","It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.","Whatever.","That's like four days from now.","Let's just calm down and- That's okay, Aang.","The eclipse will block off firebending anyway.","You don't need to know it.","Plus, it's a stupid element.","What?","Who's talking?","What?","But that was just a dream.","I'm a great climber!","Stupid Avatar!","Stupid cliff!","Stupid dream!","I can climb fast!","Of course you are.","That's 'cause you gotta fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet.","And you better win or we're all done for.","What?","It's true.","That's the deal.","He knows it.","Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.","Tell me more about this \"Fire Lord\".","Why are you so afraid of him?","Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it?","Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.","Want to try screaming into this pillow?","Then our work here is done.","Looks like it's time for another ... therapy session.","Hey!","I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked.","He's ''your'' bison.","You've been awake too long.","About what?","We made it for you.","A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away.","We hope.","We all do.","You can do this.","You're ready.","No.","That ''is'' the invasion!","Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find?","Was that a new invention?","You're making peanut sauce bombs?","Where you able to complete work on the plans I send you?","Good morning everyone.","Ahh!","Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation!","I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here?","Uh anyway, the Fire Lord's palace is here .","Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here, and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us!","And ... um ...","I'm sorry let me start at the beginning .","Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki, who's a Kyoshi warrior.","She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ... ... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ...","I messed up, Aang.","The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it.","I just fell apart.","My dad is!","He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should.","You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?","Well, I just came up with the idea.","The mechanist did all the work.","Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive?","Katara, what are you doing?","It's time to submerge.","Dad, look out!","I've got an idea.","Dad!","Can't you heal him any faster?","I'll do it.","No.","I'll lead the invasion force.","Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does.","Yip yip.","Listen up, everyone.","I want the tanks in wedge formation.","Warriors and benders in the middle.","We're taking that tower, and heading for the royal palace.","Charge!","Dad!","You're on your feet again.","Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.","What?","Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down.","The mechanist gave me this timing device.","It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse.","Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord.","What do you think?","You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord.","Whatever you decide, I'm with you.","Anything else?","Is there a structure somewhere?","Sounds like a secret bunker to me.","What would we do without you?","We'll have to be fast, but careful.","I was wrong.","We need to be fast, careful and lucky.","There's no floor.","It's just a river of lava.","That's some door!","I am so glad we added you to the group!","Only thirty seconds until the total eclipse.","Stop wasting our time and give us the information.","You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse.","Wait!","Aang!","Toph!","Stop attacking!","Don't you see what she's doing?","She's just playing with us.","She's not even trying to win this fight!","She's just baiting you again.","We don't have a choice.","We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.","Ignore!","Where.","Is.","Suki?!","Where's Suki?","Answer me!","Where are you keeping her?","I fell for it!","I used up all our time.","And now it's too late.","No.","I don't think that's a good idea.","You'll have another chance.","I know you will.","It was all a trap!","Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move!","We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can.","If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.","Everyone, let's get back to the subs!","Try and find cover!","I think we're about to see some bombs!","How are we all going to escape?","Then our only choice is to stand and fight.","We have the Avatar, we could still win.","They're at the beach already!","Bye, Dad.","We won't be apart for too long this time.","I promise.","You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?","I miss not having blisters on my feet.","Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan!","You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.","There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending.","Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future!","Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.","Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang!","He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him.","I'm not buying it.","Like when you attacked our village?","Ohhh, sorry.","I didn't mean to insult your friend!","Either you leave, or we attack.","Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.","He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes.","And you made us suck on frozen frogs?","How could I forget?","I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!","I could feel it!","It's my throatal flap!","Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him.","Oh, hooray!","In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.","Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island!","You're darn right you're not, buddy.","I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.","Let her have fun with her rocks.","I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.","Uhhh ...!","So he attacked you?","See?","You trusted Zuko, and you got burned.","Literally!","Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone.","We're gonna have to go after him.","He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him.","Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and ''really'' make him our prisoner.","He'll never suspect it!","I know how to get an angle on him!","All right buddy, don't fail me now!","Yeah, boomerang!","Awww, boomerang ... Hey, what about me?","I did the boomerang thing.","Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord.","If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it.","Hey, jerks!","Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?","Okay, take it easy.","I was just kiddin' around.","Jerkbending, still got it.","Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry.","Easy enough.","So, what?","Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing where they stood a thousand years ago?","Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.","We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.","Hey, can I talk to you for a second?","If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?","When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken.","I just want to know where they might be.","What?","Why not?","It's my dad.","He was captured too.","I need to know what I put him through.","Please.","What's that?","So, where is this place?","Nothing.","Boy, you're so paranoid.","Thanks, Zuko.","Just knowing makes me feel better.","Shhh.","Fine, you caught me.","I'm gonna rescue my dad.","You happy now?","Look, I ''have'' to do this.","The invasion plan was ''my'' idea, it was ''my'' decision to stay when things were going wrong.","It's ''my'' mistake, and it's ''my'' job to fix it.","I have to regain my honor.","You can't stop me, Zuko.","No.","I have to do this alone.","Pretty clouds.","What?","Oh, I didn't say anything.","You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.","Yep, a balloon ... but for war.","Yeah, it seems to run in the family.","I know, I know, you've changed.","I think your uncle would be proud of you.","Leaving your home to come help us?","That's hard.","Really?","You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?","That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?","My first girlfriend turned into the moon.","The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!","I don't know!","Crash-landing?","We'll figure something out!","I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.","My dad might be here!","I had to come and see!","Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place!","And for the record, I ''always'' think things through!","But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear.","So there.","It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it.","We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.","We can't blow our cover.","Super cute.","Meet back here in an hour.","Prisoners!","Am I right?","It sure looks cold in there.","Zuko?","What?","Are you sure, did you double-check?","No.","No!","So we came all this way for nothing?","I failed ... again.","Maybe we haven't failed after all!","No, what you said made no sense at all.","But look ...","It's Suki!","You mean you don't recognize me?","The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?","Well, you won't be here for long.","I'm busting you out.","You're under arrest!","Don't worry, I'll figure it out.","Oh, good, you guys have met.","So, listen, I think I have an escape plan.","I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?","So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in.","Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?","It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water.","What?","We didn't ... w-we didn't say that.","Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?","Okay, you're in.","Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside.","I need backup over here!","I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.","I know.","I don't know!","Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?","Fine.","Everybody in the cooler.","Let's go.","If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.","Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.","That supposed to make me feel better?","Seriously, not helping.","No.","I'm staying.","You guys go.","You've been here long enough.","We gave up our only chance of escaping.","I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.","The plan failed!","They're caught!","The gondola's moving.","This is it.","If my dad's not there, we've risked everything for nothing.","Come on, come on ... My dad doesn't have a nose ring.","Where is he?","That's it?","That can't be it.","Oh, no.","Dad ... Dad ...","Excuse me, coming through.","The warden wants me over there.","Sorry!","Thank goodness you're okay.","Dad, it's me.","Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.","You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?","Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.","And you know Prince Zuko?","Well, he's here too.","Actually, he's on our side now.","I know.","I had the same reaction.","After all he's done, it was hard to trust him.","But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help.","We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it.","I dunno if there's another way off this island.","Then we'd better find two.","Zuko, are you there?","I just got done talking to my dad.","We came up with an escape plan together.","I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!","Why?","Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit?","Take that ... and this!","I don't have much time.","If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up.","I just talked to my dad.","Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola.","My dad and I came up with the plan together.","We're gonna commandeer the gondola and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.","My dad already thought of that.","He said we'll need a distraction.","That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.","Not if the warden ''is'' the captive.","I have to go.","I'll find you before we start the riot.","Why?","Maybe I could schedule another time with him?","How's tomorrow?","Hey, I just got orders.","Let the prisoners out into the yard.","Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says.","This is it!","We have to start a riot.","This isn't working.","Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot.","You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?","Zuko!","Good, we're all here.","Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas!","I'm not sure.","I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!","Tell me about it.","What are you doing?","Way to think ahead.","Who's that?","Zuko, what are you doing?","Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop!","I did.","The best meat of all.","The meat of friendship and fatherhood.","We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.","Come on!","We've gotta get out of here!","We need to split up.","Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.","To Zuko!","Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?","What's with her?","What's with him?","Well, hello ...","Uh, Zuko!","Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different?","So what's on your mind?","Nah, she doesn't hate you.","Katara doesn't ''hate'' anyone.","Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation.","No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad.","I mean, bad people.","Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!","What?","Why would you want to know that?","It's not a day I like to remember.","Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid.","We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off.","As quickly as they came, they just left.","I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened.","I didn't know we had lost our mother.","Yeah ... sea ravens.","The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.","No problem.","Thanks for stopping by!","I'd thought he'd never leave.","Suki!","Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right.","Katara!","You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.","Usually it's annoying, but right now, I'm impressed.","So, can I borrow Momo for a week?","You guys are not gonna believe this!","There's a play about us.","Listen to this ... \"''The Boy in the Iceberg'' is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu-on Tim, who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar, from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.","His sources include singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war, and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage.\"","Shhh!","I'm trying to watch!","Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time!","I know!","You know, it was really unclear.","Oh, you're getting up?","Can you get me some fire flakes?","Ooh, and fire gummies!","You're one to talk, Suki.","Didn't Azula take you captive?","That's right, she did!","I'm just saying ...","He left to get me fire gummies, like, ten minutes ago.","And I'm still waiting!","Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage?","I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me.","Actually, I think I can help you.","I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be.","Just hear me out.","Here's something I think the real Sokka would say.","What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages?","A cabbage patch!","Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases, especially before an attack.","Something like ... \"Flying kick-a-pow!\".","I'm just a guy who likes comedy.","Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died.","Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start!","Shhh!","I told him to say that!","I guess that's it.","The play's caught up to the present now.","But it is over, unless ... this is the future.","But the effects were decent.","Maybe Zuko's right.","Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy.","But I know just the thing to change all that.","Beach party!","Ta da!","No, it's Suki!","Zuko's gone crazy!","I made a sand sculpture of Suki and he destroyed it!","Oh, and he's attacking Aang.","Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord now, he's going to lose.","No offense.","I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil.","All right!","Team Avatar is back!","Air.","Water.","Earth.","Fire.","Fan and sword!","All right.","Gather round, Team Avatar.","In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect.","First, Suki and I will draw his fire.","Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense, and while the Melon Lord is distracted, Aang swoops in ... and bam!","He delivers the final blow.","For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.","Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.","Watch it, Toph!","Now, Aang!","What's wrong with you?","If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now.","There, that's how it's done.","Sure you can.","You're the Avatar.","If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you.","Okay, that's everything.","He left his staff.","That's so strange.","Look, there's his footprints.","The trail ends here.","I don't think so.","There's no sign of a struggle.","Uh-uh.","He left behind his glider and Appa.","It's pretty obvious.","Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle?","He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.","Oh, yeah.","Forgot about that.","Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either.","Oh no!","I knew it was only a matter of time!","Appa ate Momo!","Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy.","That's just what Appa wants you to think.","Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom?","There's no way Aang's there.","Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.","No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on.","Hey, I remember her!","She helped you attack us!","What do you mean Aang doesn't exist?","Do you mean he's ... you know, dead?","You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal?","Ugh!","Welcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp!","How about Grand-Pakku?","Master Piandao.","He's gone.","And so is Aang.","So, Bumi ... how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?","No, not really.","What about us?","What's our destiny today?","I think that, even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet.","Thank you, Master.","We're too late!","The fleet's already taking off!","It's right ... Sshhh ... Good work, Toph!","Time to take control of the ship, take the wheel.","I was talking to Suki.","Take us down closer to the water.","I've got an idea.","Attention, crew, this is your captain speaking.","Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and sweet cream.","We have a very special birthday to celebrate.","Fire Lord Ozai, here we come.","We're not gonna catch up to him in time.","It's Aang!","He's back!","Go, Aang!","Airbending slice!","The Fire Lord is Aang's fight.","We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom.","It's gonna be a rough ride!","We need to get to the top of this thing, ''fast.''","Watch each other's backs, and if we make it that far, I'll let you know.","Suki!","Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position.","The ship will spiral and slam into the others.","Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?","My leg!","Hang on Toph!","Bye, space sword.","I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph.","It looks like this is the end.","No, Suki did.","You did it!","You should've seen yourself, it was amazing!","You were all like and the Fire Lord was all like Well, look at you, buster.","Now that your firebending's gone I guess we should call you the Loser Lord.","There's my favorite warriors!","I have to admit, I kind of missed the face paint.","So how does it feel to be in uniform again?","Careful, Suki!","Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again.","Zuko, stop moving!","I'm trying to capture the moment.","I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together.","Those are your hair loopies!","I thought it looked more exciting that way.","Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo?","In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities.","Why, I once bested a man with my'' trusty'' boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind.","Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history until our esteemed Chief of Police, Toph Beifong, singlehandedly developed the skill.","The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence has convinced this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders and he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes.","We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison."]},"Katara":{"combined_dialog":["Sokka, look!","But, Sokka!","I caught one!","Hey!","You're calling ''me'' weird?","I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!","Watch out!","Go left!","Go left!","You call that ''left?''","So it's my fault?","Ever since mom died, ''I've'' been doing all the work around camp while ''you've'' been off playing soldier!","I even wash all the clothes!","Have you ever smelled your dirty socks?","Let me tell you, ''not pleasant!''","No that's it!","I'm ''done'' helping you!","From now on, you're ''on your own!''","You mean ''I ''did that?","He's alive!","We have to help!","Stop it!","What?","What is it?","Uh, sure ...

Hey.","You're that kid.","Why did you run away before?","But, Haru's an earthbender?","He can help!","How can you say that?","Haru has a gift!","Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend.","It's a part of who we are.","I understand that Haru can help you fight back.","What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?","I'm sorry about what I said earlier.","I didn't know about your father.","Thanks.","He sounds like a great man.","So that's why you hide your earthbending.","See this necklace?","My mother gave it to me.","I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid.","This necklace is all I have left of her.","No.","Ugh!","It's not working!","We have to get help!","Haru.","There's a way ''you'' can help him.","Please, there's no one around to see you.","It's the only way!","Haru!","You did it!","It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.","I guess so.","Dawn?!","Can't we sleep in for once?","I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.","The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending!","Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.","We don't need to track him.","The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.","Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.","Aang?","Did you get all that?","How ''dare'' you call me pipsqueak, you giant-eared cretin!","A giant-eared cretin!","Look at those things!","Do herds of animals use them for shade?!","I will not back off!","I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large ''your'' ears are!","I'll show ''you'' who's boss!","Earthbending style!","I said, ''earthbending style''!","Haru!","It's my fault you were captured.","I came to rescue you.","It was the only way to find you.","It's an honor to meet you.","If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?","You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig?","What is it?","Mutiny, sabotage?","How can you say that?","You sound like you've already given up!","We'll see about that.","Earthbenders!","You don't know me, but I know of you.","Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.","Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless.","Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend.","But they can't take away your ''courage''.","And it is your courage they should truly fear!","Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home!","It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are.","Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away.","The time to fight back is now!","I can tell you the Avatar has returned!","So remember your courage earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!","I can't.","I'm not leaving.","I'm not giving up on these people.","We can't abandon these people!","There has to be a way to help them.","No!","I tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but, it didn't work!","If there was just a way to help them help themselves.","But this entire place is made of metal!","It's almost dawn.","We're running out of time!","You sure this is gonna work?","Here's your chance, earthbenders!","Take it!","Your fate is in your own hands!","All it took was a little coal.","So, I guess you're going home now.","I can't.","Your mission is to take back your home.","Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.","I know.","My mother's necklace!","It's gone!","Hey, what is that?","Aang?","Are you okay?","Shhh!","Aang, you didn't let this happen.","It has nothing to do with you.","That's why we're going to the North Pole.","To find you a teacher.","Hey, Aang!","You ready to be cheered up?","These acorns are everywhere, Aang.","That means the forest will grow back!","Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.","What happens then?","Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second?","Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this.","So ... can you help these people?","I think you can do it, Aang.","Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.","Sokka, wait!","Sokka!","I know.","Everything's going to be okay ...","It's okay, Appa, don't worry.","I'm sure they're on their way back.","I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.","It's no use, Appa.","I don't seem them anywhere.","Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.","You're back!","Where's Sokka?","Aang, what are you doing?!","Run!","Sokka!","You were trapped in the Spirit World for 24 hours!","How are you feeling?","Sokka!","I'm so proud of you, Aang.","You figured out what to do, all on your own.","That's great!","But the solstice is tomorrow!","Please don't go Aang.","The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation.","Neither can I.","We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.","Aang.","We've got trouble!","Fireball!","We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us!","There's no time!","And that's ''exactly'' why we're here.","Aww, you must be tired.","I was talking to Appa.","The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.","That's when we were at the Air Temple.","Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!","Can't you just open them with firebending?","Like you opened that other door?","You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.","It's almost sunset.","Are you ready?","Aang!","Stop!","There's nothing else we can do ... Sokka, you're a genius!","You're right.","Sokka's plan ''didn't'' work.","But it ''looks'' like it did.","Aang!","Now's your chance!","Go!","He made it!","How's Aang gonna make it out of this?","No!","Aang!","''Not'' without Aang!","I don't know.","Calm down, it's going to be okay.","If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know.","We'll need to find a good source of water first.","Remember the reason we're here.","This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect.","So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away.","Just push and pull the water like this.","The key is getting the wrist movement right.","Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.","It took me two months to learn that move.","Thanks.","This is a more difficult move.","I call it streaming the water.","It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if- Nice work.","Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.","Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard.","I haven't even totally figured it out yet.","The idea is to create a big, powerful wave.","That's enough practicing for today.","No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.","Look at this, Aang.","It's a waterbending scroll!","Check out these crazy moves.","So, how much for the, uh, ''traded'' scroll?","Aang, can we get out of here?","I feel like we're getting weird looks.","I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.","I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us.","Aang!","I thought we were running ''away'' from the pirates!","I know.","That's why I took this.","Isn't it great?","I prefer to think of it as high risk trading.","Sokka, where do you think ''they'' got it?","They stole it from a waterbender!","These are ''real'' waterbending forms.","You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending!","I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours.","Here, hold it open for me.","The single water whip.","Looks doable.","Ow!","What's so funny?","Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip.","Ugh, why can't I get this stupid move?","Will you please shut your air hole?","Believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes!","Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted!","What?","Oh my gosh, Aang, I am so sorry, I don't know what came over me.","But you know what, it won't happen again.","Here, this is yours.","I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.","I'm sorry, Momo.","No more apologies!","Shhh, Momo!","Go back to sleep.","Shh!","Ugh, ugh, ugh!","Shoot!","Come on water, work with me here!","Okay, what if I just, ow!","Stupid scroll!","Okay Katara, shift your weight through the stances.","No!","Let go of me!","Go jump in the river!","My mother's necklace!","How did you get that?","No!","Aang, this is all ''my'' fault.","Thanks, Momo.","I owe you a bushel of apples.","Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here.","Everybody in!","I couldn't have done it without your help.","Aang, look!","We can stop the boat!","Aang, together, push and pull the water!","It's working, it's slowing down!","We're doing it!","Aang, I still owe you an apology.","You were just so good at waterbending without really trying.","I got so competitive that I put us all in danger, I'm sorry.","Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway?","The scroll!","Stealing is wrong.","Unless it's from pirates.","Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?","Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp ''on top'' of the tent.","You know, so we don't get rained on?","But what if it does rain?","You're infuriating!","Well, if you don't like my firewood- Oh yeah?","Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the Tents!","Sounds good.","Wow, I could just stare at it forever.","How can you not be fascinated Sokka?","This is the largest canyon in the entire world.","Ooh, canyon guide?","Sounds informative.","You're a refugee!","Is that your tribe?","Uh, one of them, I think.","Well Aang, ready to put your peace-making skills to the test?","Everybody listen up!","This is the Avatar, and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.","He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job.","Your arms, they're broken!","You really think it'll rain?","So it was you guys who had food!","Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.","So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much?","I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins.","They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb.","Not punished enough if you ask me.","Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers.","Sokka, wait.","I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive.","You did ''not''!","That is ''so'' wrong.","We need you, Aang.","Are you all right, Aang?","You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately.","You want to tell me about it?","Well, we better ''smoothly'' fly ourselves to a market, 'cause we're out of food.","I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.","I just realized we're out of money anyway.","You could get a job, smart guy.","That's right.","Don't yell at him!","Aang would never turn his back on anyone.","Aang is the bravest person I know.","He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.","It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang?","Aang, what's wrong?","You're a horrible old man!","Appa, yip yip!","It's okay.","That fisherman was ''way'' out of line.","What do you mean?","It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?","Talk to me.","I'm going to try to get a little fire going.","So you were upset that you were the Avatar?","Why wouldn't you be excited about it?","That's awful, Aang.","I don't know what to say.","Whoa!","Hot cinders!","You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.","You ran away.","You don't know what would have-.","Aang ... You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away.","I think it was meant to be.","If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.","I know it was meant to be this way.","The world needs you now.","You give people hope.","It's okay.","You're safe.","What do you mean?","Where's Sokka?","I'm going with you!","Where are they?","Really?","I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.","This should bring your fever down.","That's nice.","I'll tell him.","Not so good, being out in that storm really did a number on him.","Aang, he's in no condition for travel.","Sokka just needs more rest.","I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.","Relax, it was just a little cough.","I'm fi- Listen carefully, Momo.","I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water.","Got it?","Momo should be back any minute.","How many times do I have to tell you, Momo?","We need water, wa-ter.","Oh forget it.","Aang, please, hurry.","Look!","Thanks, Aang.","I love it.","So, how do I look?","Stop teasing him, Sokka.","Aang's just a good friend.","A sweet, little guy!","Just like Momo.","Run downhill, then climb a tree!","Wow, it must be.","That explains why you were so calm!","Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes.","It could be fun.","That proves it!","I guess you're not ''really'' getting wet then.","Just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella.","Really?","Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.","There are things in this world that just can't be explained.","Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?","I guess that's me.","Tell me more!","You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.","Well, I liked my predictions.","Certain things are going to turn out very well.","Why?","What did she tell you?","What's with the sky?","Shhh!","She's coming!","Shhh!","Hi, Aunt Wu!","Sorry to bother you.","About this man I'm supposed to marry ... Is he going to be handsome?","Oh, I hope he's tall!","Yes, please!","Wow, thanks, Aunt Wu.","Oh wait, one more thing.","How warmly should I dress tomorrow?","Okay, okay, but one more thing.","Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?","Aww, I hate papaya.","Hey, Aang.","Ugh, papaya please.","Uh huh.","Would you like some?","Okay then.","See you later.","Can you believe she won't let me in?","And after all the business I've given her?","I know, but still ... Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before.","It's going to take an awful lot to change my mind - Oh no.","If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me.","I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.","They just won't listen to reason.","I found it.","The symbol for volcanic doom.","It's too much!","It's gonna overflow!","Wait, what did you just say?","It's okay, Sokka.","Everything's going to be all right.","Goodbye everyone!","It was so nice to meet you!","Take care, Meng.","Did someone lose something?","Wait, look!","Is this dad's boat?","Bato!","Is he here?","Bato, it looks like home!","No way!","Stewed sea prunes!","Bato, is it true that you and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?","Everyone does!","You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.","Really?","I do really miss him, it would be ''great'' to see Dad.","Even if we do have time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel.","We don't have time for a long detour.","Hey, Aang, I didn't notice you left.","He never got to go.","Dad left before he was old enough.","There's no way through!","Of course you can!","Aang, what are you talking about?","I'm with you Sokka.","Good luck.","That wolf sounds so sad.","Sokka?","You're right.","Aang!","We're getting ''you'' to the North Pole.","And ''we'' need you.","I'll be okay.","Aang, how'd you get that?","Aw, that's so sweet of Zuko.","Could you give him a kiss for me when you see him?","So, how long do you think it's been since someone was here?","It's okay Aang.","Our dad left about two years ago, with all the other Water Tribe men.","This should give us a good idea of what's around here.","I think we better keep moving.","We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.","I think we need some new disguises.","\"Flaming fire flakes\", hot?","What do you know?","Aang, hold on!","Where are we going?","It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.","Uh.","It can't hurt just to talk to him.","I'm sure there's a good reason.","Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.","Aang, you'll hurt yourself!","But you're a great master.","You have powers that I will never know.","I'm fine, we've got to get out of here.","Where's Aang?","You'll have to eventually.","It's okay, Aang.","I'm healed.","I'll explain later.","But right now, we have to get out here.","Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!","By the river.","They captured Jeong Jeong.","Aang, you're burned!","Let me help you.","I guess I always knew.","He tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook.","Was it realistic?","Is that how it was back then?","Do you think we'll really find airbenders?","Are you saying I'm a liar?","They really are airbenders!","I don't know, Aang.","That kid seemed pretty spirited.","Aang used to come here a long time ago.","I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different.","I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.","You're right.","They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins.","Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple!","Aang?","I've changed my mind.","I think I was born without that something.","No!","Aaaaah!","I can't believe I'm flying!","Teo was right about the air.","All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me.","Wait!","How do I land this thing?","What if I land over a-ack-ack-bleck!","Bug!","Bug!","Ack, that was a bug!","Aang, what are we going to do?","How can we possibly keep them all away?","Ugh, if only we knew.","Huh, that's actually pretty smart.","Yes.","But where's Sokka with the war balloon?","Those things are unstoppable!","Water?","Can you get me close to one?","Come on Sokka.","Where's that war balloon?","No, Sokka!","Hold on!","Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.","They're waterbenders!","We found the Water Tribe!","The Northern Water Tribe.","I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!","This place is beautiful.","My apologies, ''Prince'' Sokka.","Very smooth ...","I've waited for this day my whole life.","I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!","What do you mean you won't teach me?","I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me no!","But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!","I don't want to heal, I want to fight!","Well, your rules stink!","Wait!","Aang didn't mean that!","You can't risk your training for me.","You have to learn from Master Pakku, even if he is a big jerk.","Uhhh ... Hi.","Are you Yagoda?","I guess I am.","Thanks for the lesson.","Huh?","Ah ... No.","I don't think I'm ready for that yet.","My grandmother gave my mother this necklace and my mother passed it down to me.","Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?","She never told me.","If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?","How's warrior training going?","Why didn't I think of that?","At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learn from Master Pakku!","That way, you have someone to practice with, and I get to learn waterbending!","Everyone's happy!","But you're never happy.","Come on, Aang.","I got it!","That wasn't me.","Yes ... please!","Fine.","No.","No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!","I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me.","I know!","I don't care!","I'm not doing it for you!","Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!","So, you decided to show up?","Aren't you going to fight?","You can't knock me down!","But you still won't teach me, will you?","Come back here.","I'm not finished yet!","No, it's not.","It's mine!","Give it back!","But she didn't love you, did she?","It was an arranged marriage.","Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life.","That's why she left.","It must have taken a lot of courage.","You, too.","Sokka ... Aang!","What happened?","I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.","The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World!","Aang can talk to them!","The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident.","How are you going to get there this time?","It's so warm here!","How is that possible?","He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World.","It takes all his concentration.","He's crossing into the Spirit World.","He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body.","That's his way back to the physical world.","No, he's my friend.","I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.","No ... Aang!","He took Aang.","He took him right out from under me.","Okay.","It's all right.","You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.","I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard.","I'm worried that they won't.","Look, that's gotta be Aang!","Yip-yip!","Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.","It's too late, it's dead.","What about Aang?","He still needs to learn waterbending.","You too, Momo.","Aang ... Do you want to talk about it?","Thank you, Master Pakku.","Say hi to Gran-Gran for me!","Mighty Katara?","I like that.","Aang still needs to master all four elements.","Aang, no!","This is not the right way!","There's a right way to do this.","Practice, study, and discipline!","If you two meat heads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine, go ahead and glow it up!","Can we talk about something?","Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton?","It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you.","I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore.","I'm not saying the Avatar State doesn't have incredible and helpful power ... but you have to understand ... for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary.","I don't understand.","I can't watch you do this to yourself.","I'm not coming tomorrow.","Good night.","I wonder what crazy thing they're trying to do now.","Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay.","What's going on?","I can't move!","Aang, I'm sinking!","Please!","I think we're all set.","Right, let me see your stance.","Your arms are too far apart.","See, if you move them closer together, you protect your center.","You got it?","Okay, let's see what you got.","You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.","We're not river people.","Sokka's right.","We need to find King Bumi, so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.","Is this real or a legend?","That's no campfire, Moku.","It's okay, Appa.","We'll be fine.","I hope.","Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.","Everyone be quiet.","Listen.","Aang, look!","This isn't the exit.","These pictures tell their story.","They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ...","The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ... but their love was strong and they found a way.","They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly.","Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth.","But, one day, the man didn't come - he'd died in the war between the two villages.","Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ... but, instead, she declared the war over.","Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace.","The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu.","The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.","Love is brightest in the dark.","I have a crazy idea.","Never mind.","It's too crazy.","I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ... And here, it says, \"Love is brightest in the dark,\" and has a picture of them kissing.","Well, what if we ... kissed?","See?","It was a crazy idea.","Oh, well!","I didn't realize it was'' such'' a ''horrible'' option.","Sorry I suggested it!","Ugh!","Well, I'm not sure ''which'' I'd rather do!","I think so ... What ''can'' we do?","That's how the two lovers found each other.","They just put out their lights and followed the crystals.","That must be the way out!","Let's go!","Sokka!","Why is your forehead all red?","I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people who can teach you earthbending.","That wasn't as bad as I thought.","Sorry.","We were just on our way home.","Uh, he has pentapox, sir.","Umm, it's highly contagious.","And deadly.","Let's find Bumi and get out of here.","Aang, what are you doing?","Aren't you coming with us?","Oh no.","Did someone get left behind?","Oooh, you're so cute.","Mmmmm ...","Does that look like the face of a killer to you?","We've got to get the baby out of here!","There's Aang!","Is something wrong?","I don't know.","There's something ominous about that place.","Sokka, you've got an elbow leech.","You couldn't find them?","Maybe you should listen to Aang.","Something about this place feels ...","''alive.''","Appa!","Momo!","What was that?","Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?","Aang!","Sokka!","Hello?","Hello?","Can you help me?","Mom?","Mom!","I can't believe ...

You did it Appa!","Well, you know ...","Thanks.","Zuko, I can help.","I don't understand what went wrong.","He did it exactly the way you did.","I've been training Aang for a while now.","He really responds well to a positive teaching experience.","Lots of encouragement and praise.","Kind words.","If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.","Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?","Heh.","Aang, it's no big deal.","You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready.","Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on.","Okay?","You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?","Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?","That's why it's so difficult for you to get this.","You're working with your natural opposite.","But you'll figure it out.","I know you will.","Think fast!","Excellent.","You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.","It's important.","It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet.","I think we should search for him.","You found him!","You did it!","I knew you would!","You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?","Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time?","All right, we'll finish our vacations and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.","How about the Misty Palms Oasis?","That sounds refreshing.","You've made a lot of trips into the desert.","I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.","It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air.","Forget it.","It's obviously not what we're looking for.","The building in this drawing is enormous.","You got something against libraries?","Oh, right.","Sorry.","I have an authentic waterbending scroll.","Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed?","They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.","Maybe these dials represent dates and times.","Sokka, try entering that date from that parchment you took.","Hey, wait.","What happened to the sun?","That makes sense.","I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders.","This is huge.","He's sinking the building.","We've gotta get out of here.","Sokka, let's go.","Don't be stupid!","We'll find out later!","But ...!","Hurry, Sokka!","Just go!","Aang, stop it.","You know Toph did all she could.","She saved our lives.","We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now.","Aang, wait!","We'd better start walking.","We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse.","We have to get that information to Ba Sing Se.","Come on guys, we've got to stick together.","Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.","I'm sorry, it's all we have.","Sokka, wait!","You shouldn't be eating strange plants!","I don't know ...","Okay, I think you've had enough.","I don't think that's a good idea.","Come on, we need to find Aang.","What is that?","Let's just keep moving.","I hope Aang's okay ...","I'm sorry, Aang.","I know it's hard for you right now but ... we need to focus on getting out of here.","Come on, Aang.","We can do this if we work together.","Right Toph?","Sokka?","Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?","Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together!","Aang, get up.","Everybody, hold hands.","We can do this.","We have to.","I think we should stop for the night.","This is the last of it.","Everyone can have a little drink.","No, he hasn't.","Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library.","Sokka, I was there.","No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is.","We can use the stars to guide us.","That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day.","Just try to get some sleep.","We'll start again in a few hours.","Come on, get up.","We need to go.","Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit.","It's just a cloud.","Wait!","A cloud!","Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.","Wow ... there's hardly any in here.","Trying to keep everyone together.","Let's just get moving.","We need to head this direction.","It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use!","And look!","It's got some kind of compass on it!","I bet it can point us out of here!","Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it.","We're going to make it!","The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts.","That's what the compass is pointing to!","That giant rock!","It must be the magnetic center of the desert.","Maybe we can find some water there!","Sokka, there's nothing there!","We have to get out of here!","I'm completely out of water to bend!","Come on, we're going down.","Toph, shoot a rock right there.","Fire!","Yes.","Now let's move.","On your left!","We found the sailer abandoned in the desert.","We're traveling with the Avatar.","Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se.","Waterbending bomb!","Yeah!","Sorry.","Shush up about Appa.","Can't you at least try to be sensitive?","Oh ... well, okay.","I'm glad you're doing better.","Great!","We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.","Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?","I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.","You look so different without your makeup!","And the new outfit.","Appa is missing.","We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.","It says, \"abandon hope\".","What are you talking about?","Okay, if you say so.","You know, it's okay to miss Appa.","What's going on with you?","In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all.","But now you're not letting yourself feel anything.","I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care.","But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.","Come on, you need a hug.","Everyone single file!","Aang, I need help!","What is that thing?","Sokka!","Sokka, calm down.","I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home.","It's called a baby and I helped her deliver plenty of those, too.","Aang, get some rags.","Sokka, water.","Toph, I need you to make an earth tent, a big one.","Suki, come with me.","You're doing great, Ying.","Sokka, where's that water?","Now get ready to push.","One ... two ... ... three, push!","It's a girl!","Aang, you have to come see this.","She's beautiful.","You'll find him, Aang.","Aang, what are you doing here?","I thought you were looking for Appa.","And also the complaining guy.","His chi is blocked.","Who did this to you?","Ty Lee.","She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points.","It's like she takes you down from the inside.","Yes?","They come to fix it!","Hi.","What's this \"we\" stuff?","Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.","Grrr!","At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall.","This is bad, ''really'' bad.","So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through.","Wait.","You need this water more than I do!","Slurry pipeline?","What does that mean?","Why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak?","You know, I'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day!","You're like a chattering hog-monkey!","Toph, help me plug up this drain.","Enough with the Team Avatar stuff.","No matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on.","Let's talk about this on our way into the city.","Sokka ... Look, the Inner Wall!","I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.","Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa.","What's that wall for?","Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?","What's inside that wall?","Get in trouble with who?!","I got it!","I know how we're going to see the Earth King!","The king is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.","No, it just says 'bear'.","Just ... bear.","The palace will be packed.","We can sneak in with the crowd!","Why not?","Excuse me?","''I've'' got no manners?!","You're not exactly \"lady fancy fingers!\"","We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate.","Sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations.","She's blind.","Do you think you could help us?","Our family's inside and I'm sure they're ''very'' worried.","I'm Kwa Mai, and this is ... Dum.","Ow!","Uh ...","I don't see them right now, but I'm sure we'll find them soon.","Thanks for all your help.","Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in ''won't'' let us out of his sight!","So the king is just a figurehead.","You can't keep the truth from all these people.","They ''have'' to know.","What happened to Joo Dee?","Toph!","Aren't you gonna get ready for the day?","You're not gonna wash up?","You've got a little dirt on your ... everywhere, actually.","Hmm ...

You're really pretty.","Yeah, you are.","Ow!","One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.","Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city.","His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful.","I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.","Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change.","Let's fly!","We have to be careful.","Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming.","Sorry!","Sorry!","We just need to get through to see the Earth King!","You have to trust us.","So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before?","The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!","The wall.","They'll never be able to cover that up in time.","Really?","Then perhaps you could explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your \"construction project\".","It's a letter from your mom.","Your mom's here in the city.","And she wants to see you.","Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?","\"A small fleet of Water Tribe ships.\"","\"Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay.","Led by Hakoda.\"","It ''is'' Dad!","And I can't believe we know where our dad is now.","I hate to say it, but we have to split up.","You have to meet this guru, Aang.","If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.","No, Sokka.","I know how badly you wanna help Dad.","You go to Chameleon Bay.","I'll stay here with the king.","Easy there, big brother ...","Though you're right.","I am.","What is it, Aang?","Wait.","Aang.","Me too.","Or we could send in Momo to do some damage!","'Cause, the ... sorry.","I'll get these scrolls to him right away.","Thank you, General How.","What do you say, Momo?","A cup of tea before we get back to the king?","Table for two, please.","Thank goodness you're here, Suki.","Something terrible is going on.","The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle!","We have to tell the Earth King right away!","Zuko!","Why did they throw you in here?","Oh, wait, let me guess.","It's a trap.","So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches!","You're a terrible person!","You know that?","Always following us!","Hunting the Avatar!","Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace!","But what do you care?","You're the Fire Lord's son.","Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!","I don't?","How dare you!","You have no idea what this war has put me through!","Me personally!","The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.","I'm sorry I yelled at you before.","It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.","No, no, that's-that's not what I mean.","Maybe you could be free of it.","I have healing abilities.","This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole.","It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important.","I don't know if it would work, but ...

Is there anything you need?","I brought you some food!","Oh no ...","He left.","Aang.","He just took his glider and disappeared.","He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility.","It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid!","We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too?","How can he just leave us behind?","How could you leave us, Dad?","I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you.","I understand why you left.","I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way?","I'm so sad and angry and hurt!","You're okay!","I know, but you'll have our help.","Sokka, we don't need to become cave people.","What we need is some new clothes.","I call the silk robe!","How do I look?","Oh, oh, yeah.","I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it?","Where have you been?","We've been worried sick.","Sapphire Fire.","Nice to meet you.","My goodness!","That doesn't sound like our Kuzon.","Eh, if that's what you like ...","I don't know, Aang.","These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to- Okay.","Aang, everyone's watching.","We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache now.","Well, that was some dance party Aang.","It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food, assuming that'll fit into Sokka's ''master'' schedule.","We're um ... from the Earth Kingdom colonies.","Why do you guys live on the river?","Look at this place.","It's so sad.","We ''have'' to do something to help.","These people are starving!","But you'd turn your back on them?","How can you be so cold and heartless?","I guess so.","I wish I could help more.","Forty''-three'' minutes?","No way!","I think Appa's sick.","It looks like he needs some medicine.","Maybe we can find the right herbs in town.","The Painted who now?","Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.","Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit?","Why would you say that?","Look how much better off these people are.","Well, hello Avatar.","I wish I could talk, but I am very busy.","Thank you, but- A lot of people say that.","Look, I really should get going.","Hi, Aang.","I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village.","But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her.","He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine!","I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ... Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do.","Yes.","Sokka was just kidding, but he was right.","Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people

I will never, ''ever'' turn my back on people who need me!","I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can.","I thought you didn't want to help.","Sokka, you really do have a heart.","Leave this village and ''never'' come back.","Sokka, it's okay.","I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you.","But I felt like I had to do something.","It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not.","Because your problems are real, and this river is real.","You can't wait around for someone to help you.","You have to help yourself.","So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?","Wow, this is amazing to watch.","The fire is gonna destroy that town!","There's a creek over here.","I'll bend the water onto the fire.","What's your problem?","You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.","That's not true.","No one can read a map like you.","What?","What's wrong with my hair?","I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know, none of us

there's such a thing as \"space earth\".","If it's from space, then it's not really \"earth\".","I can't believe I missed you.","There are walls all around us.","It's completely safe.","I don't think so.","I get the feeling he knows who we are.","But, there's nothing here.","Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World?","Oh, Sokka, just hold hands.","You brought this on yourself.","I had no choice.","Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph!","Oh, sorry.","Did I splash you, Mud-Slug?","I'll give you a mud pie!","Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?","Ah, so she cheated.","I'm just saying this isn't something we should make a habit of doing.","I don't hate fun!","See?","Fun!","Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough.","If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen.","Oh, I'm sorry!","You think I should be more like you?","Like some wild child?","Ah.","I see.","You're acting like this because of your parents.","They were controlling over you,

wanna deal with that, so instead you act like this crazy person.","You know what?","It doesn't matter.","These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that.","We've already got some third-eyed freak after us.","We have enough money!","You need to stop this!","Well.","Look who decided to join us.","Where have you two been?","Off scamming again?","And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?","Really?","Well then.","What's this?","It's a wanted poster of you!","\"The Runaway!\"","Is that what you're called now?","Are you proud of this?","It doesn't matter where I got it.","The fact is- Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it!","Fine!","It's a lie!","But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up!","I knew you were hiding something and you were!","Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!","I wish I could!","I never said I was!","I don't act that way!","Sokka, do I act motherly?","What do you think, Aang?","Do I act like a mom?","Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!","Well, I can't be around you!","I know this is from you, Sokka!","Toph can't write!","Ugh!","You're all driving me crazy!","Hi, Toph.","Um, I wanna- Actually I wasn't going to apologize.","I was gonna say ...","I wanna pull a scam with you.","Not just any scam.","The ''ultimate'' scam.","Whaddaya say, Toph?","Just me and you.","One last go.","You in?","You brought this on yourself.","I had no choice.","The right thing is its own reward.","But, I still want the actual reward.","Really?","No kidding!","Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now?","Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?","I can't believe I'm so stupid!","See?","This is exactly why I'm against these scams!","I knew this would happen!","I know.","I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly.","I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.","I know your relationship with your parents is complicated.","And I shouldn't have said what I said.","What are we gonna do?","What about your meteor bracelet?","You can make a saw.","Just fine.","I'm making my own water.","Aang, get up!","What is it, Toph?","I'll be happy to help.","You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole.","This ship has haunted my tribe when Gran-Gran was a little girl.","It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.","I always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.","I'm making my own water!","No, wait!","I've got one!","And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.","No, it happened to Mom.","One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks.","A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm.","So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family.","When they got there, no one was home.","Just a fire flickering in the fireplace.","While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house.","When she was alone, she heard a voice.","\"It's so cold and I can't get warm!\"","Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire.","She was blue like she was frozen.","Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.","No one knows.","Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.","You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ...","Thanks for letting us stay here tonight.","You have a lovely inn.","That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you.","Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages?","That's ridiculous.","She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay.","She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.","Gee, I don't know.","Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night?","Isn't that a little mysterious?","Sokka!","Sokka, what are you doing?","You can't just snoop around someone's house.","Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!","Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!","Sokka, what are you doing?","You're breaking into a private room!","This is crazy!","I'm leaving!","You're from the Southern Water Tribe?","How did you know?","I knew I felt a bond with you right away.","You're a waterbender!","I've never met another waterbender from our tribe!","We completely understand.","We lost our mother in a raid.","I can't tell you what it means to meet you.","It's an honor.","You're a hero.","Yes!","Yes, of course!","To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.","I know!","When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do.","I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.","Wow, these flowers are beautiful.","I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside.","That was incredible!","It's a shame about the lilies, though.","But isn't that dangerous?","I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.","But ... to reach inside someone and control them?","I don't know if I want that kind of power.","I know.","It's you ... You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!","I won't!","I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town!","Stop!","Please ... You're not the only one who draws power from the moon!","My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama.","Your technique is useless on me!","I'm sorry, Aang!","No!","Nice choice, Sokka.","And we're here four days ahead of schedule.","Sokka's got the right idea, Aang.","We're here.","We're ready.","The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest.","Hey.","How long have you been up?","You know, there is such a thing as over-training.","Aang, it's the middle of the night.","You need to go back to sleep.","Aang, sleep.","Please.","For me.","Aang!","I know you're just trying to help, but you ''really'' need to get a grip.","You're unraveling.","Sokka!","You're not helping!","You know what, I've got just the thing!","Get ready to be de-stressified!","These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat.","Reach ''up''.","Reach for the sun.","Feel your chi paths clearing.","Now close your eyes.","How are you feeling?","Good, good.","Go on.","Maybe your stress is the kind you need to ''talk'' out.","So, do you feel less stressed?","Ready for a good night's sleep?","What happened, Aang?","You don't look so good.","You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?","Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you.","What big things?","Aang, what are you saying?","What are we doing?","Aang!","I was just saying you should take a nap.","What was your dream about?","Sounds neat!","Aang?","We're all starting to get a little worried about you.","Aang ...","I'm ''not'' going to hit you.","Listen to me.","You've been training for this since the day we met.","I've seen your progress.","You're smart, brave, and strong enough.","Sounds like you slept well.","You made it, Dad!","Haru!","It's so good to see you!","Wow, when he says the beginning he means the ''beginning'' beginning.","I don't see any gates.","Aang, I ... We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much.","You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore.","I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you.","Yes, it is.","Aang, don't say that, of course you'll- What?","Right, I'm on it.","Dad?","How does that feel, dad?","You're hurt, badly.","You can't fight anymore.","I'm doing everything I can.","No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.","Don't be crazy Sokka.","I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too.","Yeah.","Is that ... is that ''Aang''?","We can wait here if you want.","It's not over yet.","They're back!","Appa, you and I can help too.","We can't keep them all back!","There's too many of them!","Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?","What?","We can't leave you behind!","We won't leave anyone behind!","We'll miss you, Dad.","This is humiliating.","Both.","Uhhh ...","I think your feet need their eyes checked.","You guys go.","I think we need to talk about some things.","We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this.","Aang, no one said it's going to be easy.","We could look for Jeong Jeong!","Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?","You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you?","I mean, how stupid do you think we are?!","Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us?","You need to get out of here.","Now.","No, we won't!","Get out of here, and don't come back!","And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again!","Why would he try to fool us like that?","This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se.","He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.","The thing is, it worked.","I did feel sorry for him.","I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price.","We can't trust him.","Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!","No way!","I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!","And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free?","What a liar!","You're right, Toph!","Let's go find him and give him a medal.","The \"not as much of a jerk as you could have been\" award!","Easy for you to say!","You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates!","Why would you even try to defend him?","Well, I guess that settles that.","Has anyone seen Toph?","I think we should go look for her.","Toph!","What happened?","Oh no, what happened?","I meant, how.","Zuko?","It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better.","I wish I could have worked on them sooner.","You are a master of surprise, Sokka ...","I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.","I'm sorry.","I'm just laughing at the irony.","You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.","Maybe you're not as good as you think you are.","That's ridiculous.","Sure.","Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.","\"Need meat.","Gone fishing.","Back in a few days.","Sokka and Zuko.\"","One more thing.","\"Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone.","Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak.","Zuko.\"","What are you doing in this thing?","What happened to the war balloon?","How are you here?","What is going on?","Where did you go?","What are you doing?","Okay, I'm not crushed.","You can get off me now!","Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here.","No!","The Fire Nation can't separate our family again!","Ha, ha.","Yeah, no kidding.","You really want to know?","Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.","Or, I know!","You could bring my mother back!","You look terrible.","What do you want?","I need to borrow Appa.","Yes, it is.","We're going to find the man who took my mother from me.","Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand.","Fine, maybe it is!","Maybe that's what I need!","Maybe that's what he deserves!","It's not the same!","Jet attacked the innocent.","This man, he's a monster.","Then you didn't love her the way I did!","Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice.","It's not just hard, it's impossible.","Yes.","Don't try to stop us.","Whaletail Island, here we come.","Oh, don't you worry about my strength.","I have plenty.","I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came.","I ran as fast as I could.","But we were too late.","When we got there, the man was gone.","And so was she.","I know.","Let's do this.","It's not him.","He's not the man.","That was him.","That was the monster.","Do you know who I am?","Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it!","Why don't you take a closer look?","She lied to you!","She was protecting the last waterbender!","Me!","I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand.","There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all.","You're pathetic and sad and empty.","But as much as I hate you ...","I just can't do it.","I'm doing fine.","I wanted to do it.","I wanted to take out all my anger at him, but I couldn't.","I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or because I'm strong enough not to.","But I didn't forgive him.","I'll never forgive him.","But I am ready to forgive you.","Doesn't it seem kind of weird that we're hiding from the Fire Lord in his own house?","What?","How is that possible?","Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?","Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.","Well, that's just silly.","I don't sound like that.","Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on.","Relax, Aang.","They're not accurate portrayals.","It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time.","What?","Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth.","It hurts, doesn't it?","You didn't really say that, did you?","Does anyone know where Aang is?","I'm gonna check outside.","Are you all right?","I know it's upsetting, but it sounds like you're overreacting.","In where?","What are you talking about?","I didn't say that.","An actor said that.","Aang, I don't know.","Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about.","This isn't the right time.","Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused.","I just said I was confused!","I'm going inside.","No kidding.","Who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice?","What happened?","What's wrong with you?","You could have hurt Aang!","The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the Comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the War, but they pretty much won the War when they took Ba Sing Se.","Things can't get any worse.","I can't believe this.","Aang, you don't have to do this alone.","Get over here, Zuko.","Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.","Actually, I used it all up after Azula shot you.","I have a surprise for everyone!","Uh, no.","I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this!","Look at baby Zuko.","Isn't he cute?","Oh, lighten up.","I'm just teasing.","Aang, we do understand.","It's just ... We're trying to help!","Aang, don't walk away from this.","Maybe he was captured.","Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island.","Let's split up and look for him.","Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo.","He's probably with Aang.","What should we do Zuko?","Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.","And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?","I'm not his girlfriend!","I have Aang's staff.","Not just any old people.","These are great masters and friends of ours.","Pakku.","That's so exciting!","You and Gran-Gran must be so happy to have found each other again!","And this was Aang's first firebending teacher.","Are you okay?","Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?","Then he'll forgive you.","He will.","It would be my pleasure.","Goodbye, General Iroh.","Zuko, don't worry.","We can take Azula.","Aang won't lose.","He's gonna come back.","He has to.","And you're going down.","What are you doing?","She's playing you.","She knows she can't take us both, so she's trying to separate us.","But even ''you'' admitted to your uncle that you would need help facing Azula.","Zuko!","I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.","That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka.","Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears?","She's strong.","It's so good to see all of you.","Well, Jinora, it's an ''incredible'' tale-- The baby's ''strong''.","I see another airbender in your future.","Kya and Bumi certainly were, but Tenzin has always been ... rather serious.","Nice night for an escape, isn't it?","I know you do.","Aang's time has passed.","My brother and many of my friends are gone.","It's time for you and your generation to take over the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world.","And I think you're going to be a great Avatar.","Goodbye, Korra.","I've tried everything in my power, but ...","I cannot restore Korra's bending.","I'm sorry, there's nothing else I can do.","Korra can still airbend, but her connection to the other elements has been severed.","Oh ... you've all gotten so big.","I think you forgot a couple of things.","This is your family, Tenzin.","When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings.","Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together.","What happened?","Oh my goodness!","How long has she been away?","I don't know, but she is very strong to have lasted this long.","The poison did a lot of internal damage.","I can help guide your healing process, but whether you get better or not, is up to you.","I know what it's like to go through a traumatic experience.","And I promise you, if you dedicate yourself to getting better, you'll recover, stronger than ever.","Then try something for me.","Concentrate on your big toe.","Visualize it moving.","Breathe.","The mind can be a powerful ally, or your greatest enemy.","Now, I want you to try taking a step.","You're okay.","Your body thinks it is still in danger, but you're safe here.","Use your mind to overcome the pain.","Try again.","Whenever you're ready.","It's ... all right.","Let your anger and frustration ''flow'' like water.","Korra, I know you feel alone right now.","But you're not the first Avatar who's had to overcome great suffering.","Can you imagine how much pain Aang felt when he learned that his ''entire culture'' was taken from him?","But he never let it destroy his spirit.","He chose to find ''meaning'' in his suffering and eventually ... found peace.","I don't know.","But won't it be interesting to find out?","Close your eyes.","Visualize yourself walking over to Naga.","Can you see it?","Now ... take that first step."]},"Zuko":{"combined_dialog":["Finally!","Uncle, do you realize what this means?!","It means my search is about to come to an end.","That light came from an ''incredibly'' powerful source!","It has to be him!","I don't need any calming tea!","I need to capture the Avatar!","Helmsman, head a course for the light!","Because their ''honor'' didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture.","Mine ''does.''","This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.","Enough!","I've been drilling this sequence all day.","Teach me the next set!","I'm ''more'' than ready!","The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.","He must be over a hundred years old by now.","He's had a century to master the four elements!","I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.","You ''will'' teach me the advanced set!","The last airbender!","Quite agile for his old age.","Wake my uncle!","Tell him I found the Avatar.","As ''well'' as his hiding place ... Where are you hiding him?","I ''know'' you're hiding him!","''You're'' the airbender?","''You're'' the Avatar?","I've spent years preparing for this encounter.","Training, meditating.","You're just a child!","Head a course for the Fire Nation.","I'm going home.","This staff will make an excellent gift for my father.","I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks.","Take the Avatar to the prison hold, and take this to my quarters.","Looks like I underestimated you.","What is that?","Shoot them down!","That \"kid\", Uncle, just did ''this.''","I won't underestimate him again.","Dig the ship out and follow them!","As soon as you're done with that.","Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible.","I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.","Don't mention his name on these docks!","Once word gets out that he's alive, every firebender will be out looking for him, and I don't want anyone getting in the way!","Captain Zhao.","Yes.","You wouldn't believe what happened.","Uncle!","Tell Commander Zhao what happened.","Yes!","Right into ... an Earth Kingdom ship!","Sorry, but we have to go.","If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool!","We haven't found him yet.","No.","Nothing.","I haven't found anything.","It's like you said.","The Avatar probably died a long time ago.","Come on, Uncle, we're going.","I underestimated him ''once'', but it will ''not'' happen again!","Commander Zhao, I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I - Why?","Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?","Don't underestimate me, Zhao!","I will capture the Avatar before you!","You're wrong!","Once I deliver the Avatar to my father, he will welcome me home with honor, and restore my rightful place on the throne!","That's not true.","Maybe you'd like one to match!","An Agni Kai.","At sunset.","I will never forget.","I refuse to let him win.","Next time you get in my way, I promise, I won't hold back.","Did you really mean that, Uncle?","The only reason you should be interrupting me, is if you have news about the Avatar.","Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader.","Now, whatever you have to say, I'm sure I can take it.","What!?","Give me the map!","The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?","Uncle, ready the rhinos.","He's not getting away from me this time.","I was going to save it for later!","I want the Avatar ''alive.''","Come out, Avatar!","You can't hide from me forever!","Find him.","Nice try, Avatar!","But these little girls can't save you.","Finally!","Back to the ship!","Don't lose sight of them!","Uncle!","It's time to leave!","Where are you?","Uncle Iroh!","Uncle?","We need to move on.","We're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him.","My troubles cannot be soaked away.","It's time to go!","Enough!","We need to leave now.","Get out of the water!","On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes?","But be back at the ship in a half-hour or I'm leaving without you!","Uncle!","Uncle, where are you?","Something's not right here.","That pile of rocks.","Land doesn't slide uphill.","Those rocks didn't move naturally.","My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!","Yeah, that's Uncle Iroh.","The Avatar!","You taught me well.","Now would you please put on some clothes?","Having trouble sleeping?","Seen the Avatar lately?","I have no choice, Uncle.","I'm chasing the Avatar!","My father will understand why I am returning home!","There they are.","Helmsman!","Full steam ahead!","On my mark!","Fire!","A blockade.","He's not turning around!","I'm sorry, Uncle.","Run the blockade!","Do ''not'' stop this ship.","We can make it!","What's he up to, Uncle?","Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?","If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.","Uncle, keep heading north.","Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover.","The Avatar's coming with me!","Close the doors!","Quickly!","Why isn't it working?","It's sealed shut!","Why did you help the Avatar?","You're too late, Zhao!","The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.","What is the meaning of this mutiny?","No one told you to change course!","Is it something to do with the Avatar?","Lotus tile?","You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?","It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time ''for everyone''!","You bought a tsungi horn?","This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?","We don't need to stop.","They stole a waterbending scroll, right?","Then they'll be on the water.","I'll save you from the pirates.","Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.","Try to understand.","I need to capture him to restore something I've lost, my honor.","Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost.","I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering.","''Tell me'' where he is.","I wonder how much this is worth ...

Ahh!","We're not taking any more chances with these plants!","We need to get help.","If the Earth Kingdom discovers us, they'll have us killed.","Earth Kingdom it is.","Names?","Of course we have names.","I'm, uh ... Lee and this is my Uncle, uh ... Mushi?","Sorry, but we need to be moving on.","I haven't seen my father in many years.","Yeah.","Thank you.","I know.","They're about to show us a little more kindness.","Well?","This is humiliating!","We're royalty!","These people should be giving us whatever we want.","We're ''not'' performers.","What does it matter where they came from?","Do you like your new teapot?","There's no honor for me without the Avatar.","Then there is no hope at all.","Uncle ...","I thought a lot about what you said.","It's helped me realize something.","We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together.","I need to find my own way.","Could I get some water, a bag of feed and something hot to eat?","No.","No.","Maybe a chicken flew over.","No kidding.","I'm ... uh ...","I can't.","I should be moving on.","Mm-mm.","Far away.","You're holding them wrong.","Keep in mind, these are dual swords.","Two halves of a single weapon.","Don't think of them as separate, 'cause they're not.","They're just two different parts of the same whole.","Trouble.","No.","I need to move on.","Here.","I want you to have this.","Read the inscription.","The other one.","Azula always lies.","I'll get your son back.","Let the kid go.","My name is Zuko.","Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai.","Prince of the Fire Nation, and heir to the throne.","It's yours.","You should have it.","Yes, I really do.","Back off, Azula!","He's mine!","Uncle ... Aaaah!","Ugggh!","Get away from us!","Leave!","Uncle ... you were unconscious.","Azula did this to you.","It was a surprise attack.","I hope I made it the way you like it.","So Uncle, I've been thinking.","It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again.","I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her.","I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her.","I see.","That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind.","I'm ready to try it!","Why can't I do it?","Instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face ... like everything always does.","What turmoil?","But I don't feel any shame at all.","I'm as proud as ever.","Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately.","Why are you telling me these things?","All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.","You can teach me to redirect lightning?","I think so.","Great, I'm ready to try it with real lightning!","I thought that was the point!","You teaching me to protect myself from it!","Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning.","You've always thrown everything you could at me!","Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back!","Come on, strike me!","You've never held back before!","Maybe we should make camp.","You know these guys?","Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you.","No one here is going to help us.","These people just look like filthy wanderers.","You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?","What are you old gasbags talking about?","I thought you said he would help!","Look around.","We're not tourists, we're refugees.","Ugh!","I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt.","I'm tired of living like this!","Hello.","I'm in.","I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path.","I'm going to forget I saw that.","Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.","I said no.","What are you doing firebending your tea?","For a wise, old man, that was a pretty stupid move!","This city is a prison.","I don't want to make a life here.","Ridiculous.","Uncle, that's what ''all'' tea is.","We've been working in a tea shop all day!","I'm ''sick'' of tea!","You want a show?","I'll give you a show!","''You're'' the one who needs help.","Uncle, we have a problem.","One of the customers is on to us.","Don't look now but there is a girl over there at the corner table.","She knows we're Fire Nation.","Didn't I say don't look?!","What?","My name's Lee.","My uncle and I just moved here.","It took my uncle ten minutes to do my hair.","It's okay.","Nothing.","She is not my girlfriend!","You have ... quite an appetite for a girl.","Umm ... well, we've been traveling around for a long time.","We were ... uh, part of this traveling circus.","Yes, I juggled.","I haven't practiced for a while.","Close your eyes, and don't peek.","Okay, now you can look.","I've brought you something.","It's a coupon for a free cup of tea.","It's complicated.","I have to go.","It was nice.","Uncle?","What are you looking at?","Is there something out there?","I don't feel right.","So thirsty.","I'm not tired.","What's happening?","What's that mean?","What's that smell?","Actually, it smells delicious.","I'd love a bowl, Uncle.","It's a new day.","We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop.","Things are looking up, Uncle.","Congratulations, Uncle.","You deserve it.","The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.","Now let's make these people some tea!","Uncle!","I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee!","What is it, Uncle?","It sure is, Uncle.","What's taking so long?","Something's not right.","Azula!","No!","I'm tired of running!","It's time I faced Azula!","Yes!","I challenge you!","You don't know what you're talking about!","I'm sorry.","That's something we have in common.","It doesn't matter.","My face?","I see.","It's okay.","I used to think this scar marked me.","The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever.","But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.","What?","It's a scar, it can't be healed.","Uncle, I don't understand.","What are you doing with the Avatar?","Why, Uncle?","Release him immediately.","I have changed.","I betrayed Uncle.","But I don't have the Avatar.","What if Father doesn't restore my honor?","I've got a lot on my mind.","It's been so long, over three years since I was home.","I wonder what's changed.","I wonder how ''I've'' changed.","I haven't seen Dad yet.","I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished.","So, I didn't capture the Avatar.","No.","There's no way he could have survived.","What did you hear?","Why'd you do it?","Why did you tell Father that I was the one who killed the Avatar?","It.","Can't.","But why?","You're lying.","You have another motive for doing this, I just haven't figured out what it is.","I'm going in for a visit.","You're going to stand guard here, and ''no one'' is going to know about this.","Uncle, it's me.","You brought this on yourself you know.","We could have returned together.","You could have been a hero!","You have no right to judge me, Uncle.","I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me.","You're not going to say anything?","You're a crazy old man!","You're crazy!","And if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter!","You're so beautiful when you hate the world.","I don't hate you too.","Can't you see we're busy?","That guard told you.","Okay, you caught me.","What is it that you want, Azula?","I brought you some komodo chicken.","I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food.","I admit it, I have everything I always wanted, but it's not as all how I thought it would be.","The truth is, I need your advice.","I think the Avatar is still alive, I ''know'' he's out there, I'm losing my mind.","Please, Uncle, I'm so confused I need your help.","Forget it, I'll solve it myself!","Waste away in here for all I care!","You're sure you weren't followed?","I've heard about you.","They say you're good at what you do, and even better at keeping secrets.","The Avatar is alive.","I want you to find him, and end him.","Doing nothing is a waste of time.","We're being sent away on a forced vacation.","I feel like a child.","That was a long time ago.","It smells like old lady in here.","Here.","This is for you.","I saw it, and I thought it was pretty.","Don't girls like stuff like this?","Forget it!","I thought, since it's so hot ... here.","Why didn't you tell those guys who we were?","He thinks he's so great.","Well, what do you think of him?","You like him, don't you?","I know.","So what?","Sure.","Hey, watch it!","That food was for my cranky girlfriend!","Stop talking to my girlfriend!","What's wrong with ''me''?","Well, at least I feel something, as opposed to you.","You have no passion for anything!","You're just a big blah!","I was just leaving.","Those summers we spent here seem so long ago.","So much has changed.","Where's your new boyfriend?","Are you cold?","What does it look like I'm doing?","You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business?","No, you don't.","You're stuck in your little \"Ty Lee world\" where everything's great all the time.","\"I'm so pretty.","Look at me.","I can walk on my hands.","Whoo!\"","Circus freak.","Yeah, you do not believe in anything.","I'm sorry, too.","I wish you ''would'' be high-strung and crazy for once instead of keeping all your feeling bottled up inside.","She just called your aura dingy.","Are you gonna take that?","I like it when you express yourself.","My life hasn't been that easy either, Mai.","Bad skin?","''Normal'' teenagers worry about bad skin.","I don't have that luxury.","My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my ''face''!","For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy.","I'm back home now, my dad talks to me.","Ha!","He even thinks I'm a hero.","Everything should be perfect, right?","I should be happy now, but I'm not.","I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!","No one.","I'm just angry.","Everyone.","I don't know.","No, no.","No, no, n-no, no!","Because I'm confused.","Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.","I guess you wouldn't understand, would you, Azula?","Because you're just ''so'' perfect.","Party's over.","You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise.","It will reveal your own destiny.","Wait, I need to ask you something.","What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history?","But how did he die?","What does it mean?","The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the Dragonbone Catacombs.","The final testimony of Fire Lord Sozin.","That can't be it!","Where's the rest of it?","You sent this, didn't you?","I found the secret history, which by the way should be renamed history most people already know!","The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end.","What are you talking about?","Why are you telling me this?","I'm just going to Mai's house.","It's not far.","Tell me, if you could have anything you want right now, what would it be?","You know, being a prince and all, I ''might'' just be able to make that happen.","Do you think you could find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top?","War meeting?","What are you talking about?","I guess I wasn't invited.","So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh?","And apparently I'm not welcome there.","Oh, yeah?!","I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it!","Well, were you invited?","And I'm the prince!","Forget it!","I'm not going!","I don't.","I know.","What?","So, my dad ''wants'' me at the meeting?","When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me.","My father had saved me a seat.","He wanted me next to him.","I was ''literally'' at his right hand.","During the meeting, I was the perfect prince.","The son my father wanted.","But I wasn't me.","I'm sorry Mai.","I know I've made some bad choices, but today, I'm gonna set things right.","I'm ready to face you.","I'm here to tell the truth.","First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.","Because the Avatar's not dead.","He survived.","In fact, he's probably leading this invasion.","He could be on his way here right now.","That's another thing.","I'm not taking orders from you anymore.","Think again.","I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen.","For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me.","I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you.","You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.","My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai.","How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?","It was cruel!","And it was wrong.","No, I've learned everything!","And I've had to learn it on my own!","Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history.","And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world.","What an amazing lie that was.","The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation.","They don't see our greatness.","They hate us!","And we deserve it!","We've created an era of fear in the world.","And if we don't want the world to destroy itself , we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.","Yes.","He has.","After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness.","He's the one who's been a real father to me.","But I've come to an even more important decision.","I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.","Because I know my own destiny.","Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.","Goodbye.","What happened that night?","So she's alive?","The only view I'm interested in seeing is the Avatar in chains.","First we'll check each of the air temples, then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him.","What else would I expect to hear from the ''laziest'' man in the Fire Nation?","The only way to regain my honor is to find the Avatar, so I will.","Hello ... Zuko here, but I guess you probably already know me, sort of.","Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm considered to be pretty good at it.","Well, you've seen me, you know, when I was attacking you.","Uhhh ... yeah, I guess I should apologize for that.","But anyway, I'm good now.","I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad, but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught the Avatar firebending.","Well, what's your answer?","Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too.","How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side?","What would Uncle do?","Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self.","Only then will your true self, reveal itself.","Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means.","What would Azula do?","Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends.","Your choice.","I guess I'm just not that good at impersonations.","Hello ... Zuko here.","Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so, I just thought I'd wait for you here.","I know you must be surprised to see me here.","Right.","Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I can teach firebending to you.","See, I, uhhh ...","I've done some good things!","I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free.","That's something!","I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes in the past.","Look, I admit I've some awful things.","I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe.","And I never should have sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.","I'm going to try and stop- Well, that's not his name, but- He's not my friend!","Why aren't you saying anything?","You once said you thought we could be friends.","You know I have good in me.","I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore!","If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.","Uggh!","I can't believe how stupid I am!","I mean, what was I thinking?","Telling them I sent an assassin after them?","Why didn't I just say Azula did that?","They would have believed that!","Stupid!","Uggh!","Who's there?","Stay back!","I'm sorry, it was a mistake!","Let me help you!","I'm sorry!","I didn't know it was you!","Uggh, come back!","Uggh!","Why am I so bad at being good?","Stop!","I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore!","The mission is off.","I'm ordering you to stop.","If you keep attacking, I won't pay you!","All right, I'll pay you double to stop!","Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard.","But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth.","I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me.","But I know now that no one can give you your honor.","It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right.","All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world.","I'm sorry for what I did to you.","It was an accident.","Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally.","Thank you.","I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.","I won't let you down!","I promise!","If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar.","I know it's my destiny to capture him.","I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is ''not'' something to fear.","But if you don't respect it, it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!","Now show me what you've got.","Any amount of fire you can make.","Good idea.","You might wanna take a couple steps back.","What was that?","That was the worst firebending I've ever seen!","Why is this happening?","Yeah, could be.","Just breathe, and ... Don't patronize me!","You know what it's supposed to look like!","And stop calling me that!","Get out of here!","Listen everybody, I've got some pretty bad news.","I've lost my stuff.","I'm talking about my firebending.","It's gone.","Well, it's not lost.","It's just ... weaker for some reason.","I bet it's because I changed sides.","Okay, cut it out!","Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore.","There has to be another way.","Well, this doesn't help me.","The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct.","Well, they aren't around anymore, okay?","But maybe there's another way.","The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors.","No, they died off thousands of years ago.","But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now.","Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins.","More or less.","Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher.","We've been riding for hours.","I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster.","I can't believe this.","Even though these buildings are ancient, there's something eerily familiar about them.","I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these.","I can't believe it.","This booby trap must be centuries old and it still works.","Where's that up-beat attitude you were talkin' about?","Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting.","They look pretty angry to me.","Well, they had a funny way of showing it.","My great-grandfather Sozin happened.","He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory.","There were the ultimate firebenders.","And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents would become legendary and you'd earn the honorary title, Dragon.","The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born, by my uncle.","He had a complicated past.","Family tradition, I guess.","Let's just move on.","Wait.","It's a celestial calendar.","Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples.","I bet that sunstone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle.","On the solstice.","No, we can't.","But we might be able to speed time up.","Let's see if we can outsmart the sunstone.","Come on ...","Relax.","They're just statues.","What?","This better teach us some really good firebending.","It's some kind of mystical gemstone.","Why not?","It feels almost alive.","Ugh, I can't pull free.","It's like some kind of glue.","Me?","I can't move either!","At least we have air.","Maybe if we stay calm, we can figure a way out of this.","At least I made something happen.","If it were up to you, we'd never have made it past the courtyard.","Who are you yelling to?","Nobody's lived here for centuries.","We didn't come here to take your sunstone.","We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.","My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.","O-or at least I used to be.","I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage.","But now I want to learn the true way, the original way.","When we came here, I never imagined the Sun Warrior's civilization was secretly alive.","I am truly humbled to be in your presence.","Please, teach us.","I don't believe it.","Hurry up.","Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small.","You're too timid, give it more juice.","You can do it.","I know you can.","You're a talented kid.","No, we're seeing this through to the end.","We're gonna meet these masters and find out what's so great about them.","Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar.","I think we could take these guys in a fight, whoever they are.","Bring 'em out!","No, just make your own.","These are the masters.","Sshh.","I never said that.","Fine.","I understand.","Their fire was beautiful.","I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.","I can't believe there are still living dragons.","My uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it.","He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them.","Yeah.","It's like the Sun, but inside of you.","Do you guys realize this?","That's why my firebending was so weak before.","Because for so many years, hunting you was my drive ... it was my purpose.","So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire.","But now, I have a new drive.","I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world.","It's not a dance.","It's a firebending form.","It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!","The Dancing Dragon.","No one can make tea like Uncle , but hopefully I learned a thing or two.","Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?","Okay.","Well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punch line is \"Leaf me alone, I'm bushed!\"","Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.","So, what's up?","What do you mean?","Who was captured?","I can't tell you.","Trust me.","Knowing would just make you feel worse.","It's not good, Sokka.","My guess is, they were taken to the Boiling Rock.","The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.","It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.","It's inescapable.","Why do you need to know?","What are you planning?","It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation.","You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.","Yeah, I'm sure it does.","Not up to anything, huh?","I'm never happy.","You need to regain your honor?","Believe me, I get it.","I'm going with you.","How are you going to get there?","On Appa?","Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares.","We'll take my war balloon.","Yeah ... fluffy.","What?","No kidding.","If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war.","Hey, hold on.","Not everyone in my family is like that.","I meant my uncle.","He was more of a father to me.","And I really let him down.","It wasn't that hard.","Well, I did have a girlfriend.","Mai.","Yeah.","Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor.","I couldn't drag her into it.","That's rough, buddy.","There it is!","There's plenty of steam to keep us covered.","As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.","We're going down!","The balloon's not working anymore!","So what are we supposed to do?","How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?","You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?","Uncle always said I never thought things through.","But this ... this is just crazy!","What are you doing?","I hope you know what you're doing.","There's no turning back now.","I hope these disguises work.","Uh, very cute, sir.","But what if there's an incident?","If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head.","Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?","No, that's not it.","The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right?","So what about war prisoners?","Hey there, fellow guard, how goes it?","Shhh!","Listen, I asked around the lounge.","There are no Water Tribe prisoners.","I'm afraid your father's not here.","Yeah, I'm sure.","I'm really sorry, Sokka.","That's the spirit!","I can't believe that worked.","I didn't even know what I was saying.","How did you know who I am?","You're Mai's uncle?","I never meant to hurt her.","So what's in it for you?","Why don't you just tell my father to come collect a reward?","We did?","Oh, sorry about that.","Nice to see you again.","Yeah ...","The cooler as a boat?","Are you sure?","Yeah, you heard wrong.","There's nothing to get in on.","Hey, you watch who you're shoving!","Yes, I have ... completely.","Someone's coming!","War prisoners.","It could be your father.","Well, what should we do?","Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?","It's your call, Sokka.","Are you sure you wanna go?","You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself.","Redeem your honor.","Rescuing your dad is your chance.","No, it's not.","Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.","Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ... You have to try every time.","You can't quit because you're afraid you ''might'' fail.","I'm staying, too.","Is that him?","I'm here.","What are you doing?","Where are you taking me?","I didn't do anything wrong!","Mai!","How did you know I was here?","But, how- I didn't mean to - Stop!","This isn't about you.","This is about the Fire Nation!","Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.","But I have to do this to save my country.","That's not how I see it.","And how do we do that?","I thought you thought this through!","Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important!","Back off!","We've got the warden!","Let's go!","I'm making it so they can't stop us.","That's a problem.","It's my sister and her friend.","Me too.","They're cutting the line!","The gondola's about to go!","It's Mai!","My sister was on that island.","What I mean is she must have come here somehow.","There!","That's our way out of here!","It kind of got destroyed.","Watch out!","Keeping rocks from crushing you.","I'll take that as a thank you.","Go ahead!","I'll hold them off.","I think this is a family visit.","What are you doing here?","She's ... not gonna make it ... Of course she did.","If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you.","I'm touched.","I don't deserve this.","I wish I knew.","This isn't fair!","Everyone else seems to trust me now!","What is it with you?","What can I do to make it up to you?","Sorry, do you need to talk to Sokka, too?","Your sister.","She hates me!","And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me.","Stop.","Okay, listen.","I know this may seem out of nowhere, but I want you to tell me what happened to your mother.","Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se, and again just now when she was yelling at me.","I think somehow she's connected her anger at that to her anger at me.","Wait.","Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village?","Like what the lead ship looked like?","The symbol of the Southern Raiders.","Thanks, Sokka.","I waited out here all night.","I know who killed your mother, and I'm going to help you find him.","Sokka told me the story of what happened.","I know who did it and I know how to find him.","She needs this, Aang.","This is about getting closure and justice.","That's cute, but this isn't air temple preschool.","It's the real world.","That's the same as doing nothing!","Okay, we'll be sure to do that, guru goody-goody.","We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower.","All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk.","And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed.","Not exactly.","We need to be stealthy and make sure no one spots us, otherwise they'll warn the Southern Raiders long before we reach them.","You should get some rest.","We'll be there in a few hours.","You'll need all your strength.","Your mother was a brave woman.","There!","See those sea raven flags?","It's the Southern Raiders.","This is it, Katara.","Are you ready to face him?","You don't remember her?","You will soon, trust me.","Think back.","Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe.","Don't lie!","You look her in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did.","What?","What do you mean he's not?","He's the leader of the Southern Raiders!","He has to be the guy!","If you're not the man we're looking for, who is?","We weren't behind the bush.","And I wouldn't try firebending again!","You were right about what Katara needed.","Violence wasn't the answer.","Then I have a question for you.","What are you gonna do when you face my father?","I told you, my father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy.","And that was a long time ago.","It's the last place anyone would think to look for us.","Ugh!","My mother used to take us to see them.","They butchered ''Love Amongst the Dragons'' every year!","Just sit next to me.","What's the big deal?","They make me look totally stiff and humorless.","So far, this intermission is the best part of the play.","Did Jet just ... die?","I might as well have.","You don't get it, it's different for you.","You get a muscly version of yourself, taking down ten bad guys at once, and making sassy remarks.","But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life, and shoves them back in my face.","My uncle, he's always been on my side, even when things were bad.","He was there for me, he taught me so much, and how do I repay him?","With a knife in his back.","It's my greatest regret, and I may never get to redeem myself.","How do you know?","Really?","Oh, sorry.","Ow!","What was that for?","The scar's not on the wrong side!","That ... wasn't a good play.","More ferocious!","Imagine striking through your opponent's heart!","Hey!","Your lesson's not over yet!","Get back here!","Fine!","If you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day, then go ahead!","Teaching you a lesson!","Go ahead and do it!","What's wrong with ''me''?","What's wrong with all of you?","How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet is only three days away?","Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?","After?","So, you all knew Aang was going to wait?","You're wrong.","It's about to get worse than you can even imagine.","The day before the eclipse, my father asked me to attend an important war meeting.","It was what I dreamed about for so many years.","My father had finally accepted me back.","The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong.","They can endure anything, as long as they have hope.","Well, that's not exactly what I- I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan, but I'm ashamed to say I didn't.","My whole life, I struggled to gain my father's love and acceptance, but once I had it, I realized I'd lost myself getting there.","I'd forgotten who I was.","I know you're scared, and I know you're not ready to save the world, but if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes, there won't be a world to save anymore.","I didn't think I had to.","I assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet.","No one told ''me'' you decided to wait.","There's one technique you need to know before facing my father - how to redirect lightning.","If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it.","You turn your opponents' energy against them.","Exactly.","My uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.","Once, against my father.","Exhilarating ... but terrifying.","You feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body, but you know if you make the wrong move, it's over.","You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life before he takes yours.","What are you waiting for?","Take him out!","That's not me.","It's my father.","Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers.","You're going to defend him?","Like what?","Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again.","No!","Let him go.","He needs time to sort it out by himself.","Aang?","Aang!","Aang's not in the house.","Let's check the beach.","But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?","Uh-huh.","Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang.","No.","It's like he just ... disappeared.","Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka.","We have a real problem here.","Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away.","I don't know.","Why are you all looking at ''me''?","Just trust me.","June.","The shirshu.","It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world.","It's the one shot we have of finding him.","Yup.","Back in the good old days.","He's my uncle.","And he's not here.","She's not my girlfriend!","I need your help finding the Avatar.","Well, what does that mean?","Wait.","I have another idea.","There's only one other person in this world who can help us face the Fire Lord.","I'll be right back with a smell sample.","Hey!","Wait up!","We're going to Ba Sing Se?","It's been a long day.","Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.","The Order of the White Lotus.","Nah.","Where ... where is he?","No, I'm not okay.","My uncle hates me, I know it.","He loved and supported me in every way he could, and I still turned against him.","How can I even face him?","More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life.","Uncle?","Uncle, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me.","But I want you to know, I am so, so, sorry, Uncle.","I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did.","I don't know how I can ever make it up to you.","But I'll- How can you forgive me so easily?","I thought you would be furious with me.","I did lose my way.","It wasn't that hard, Uncle.","You have a pretty strong scent.","Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.","That's what I just said!","We need you to come with us!","You can beat him!","And we'll be there to help.","And then ... then you would come and take your rightful place on the throne?","Unquestionable honor?","But I've made so many mistakes.","I'll try, Uncle.","I can handle Azula.","You're right.","Katara, how would you like to help me put Azula in her place?","So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?","It's not her I'm worried about.","I'm worried about Aang.","What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my father?","What if he loses?","Sorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today.","''I'' am.","You're on.","I know.","But I can take her this time.","No you're not.","No lightning today?","What's the matter?","Afraid I'll redirect it?","No!","Thank you, Katara.","Mai!","You're okay!","They let you out of prison?","So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?","I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down.","And now ... Yeah, we ''are ''friends.","And it's gonna be even more different... when we build it together.","Please.","The real hero is the Avatar.","Today this war is finally over!","I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation.","And I will.","The road ahead of us is challenging.","A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided.","But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the right path and begin a new era of love and peace.","You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life.","Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life.","It put me on the right path.","Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you.","At least you don't look like a boar-q-pine!","My hair is not that spiky!","How could you let this happen?","No!","This can't be.","Do you have any idea the power these criminals possess?","Individually, they can take down any bender.","Put them all together, they could take down the entire world.","And now you're telling me that their leader is an airbender?","We don't need to track them, I know exactly where they're going.","Notify the new chiefs of the Northern Water Tribe that an attack on their prison is imminent, and send word to Lin Beifong in Republic City.","The Avatar must be protected.","To stop them.","Then you should enjoy this.","We need to check on a secret ice prison in the western tundra.","We built this place secretly with your father to hold a very special prisoner.","She's a powerful firebender named P'Li who can create explosions with her mind.","Ironically, I hired a guy with a similar ability to kill the Avatar myself once.","Didn't work.","The intense cold prevents her from firebending.","That's what we thought about the other three prisons.","The only thing I saw was a snowstorm heading our way.","I met you when you were a very young girl.","It's good to see you again, Avatar Korra.","It's a pleasure to meet you as well.","I'm sorry, but I can't.","I'm going back to the Fire Nation.","If it's true that the Red Lotus is targeting the nations' leaders, I need to protect my daughter.","I was often Aang's counsel and I'd love to be yours.","Hmm.","Rebuilding the Air Nation was Aang's biggest dream.","He would be beside himself with joy with what you've done.","And if he accomplished that goal, he might have sacrificed anything to protect it.","I don't know for sure.","The airbenders might have been closest to Aang's heart, but, as the Avatar, he was concerned with people of all nations.","No one knew better than Aang that in times of turmoil, the world needs its Avatar the most.","Wait, you spoke with my uncle?","And even with Zaheer locked up again, we still don't know how many Red Lotus members might be out there, hiding."]},"Iroh":{"combined_dialog":["I won't get to finish my game?","Or it's just the celestial lights.","We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.","I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.","Please, sit.","Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?","I'm going to bed now.","Yep, a man needs his rest.","Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.","Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.","Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed.","Again.","No!","Power in firebending comes from the breath , not the muscles.","The breath becomes energy in the body.","The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire!","Get it right this time.","No, you are impatient.","You have yet to master your basics.","Drill it again!","Very well, but first, I must finish my roast duck.","Duh?","Huh?","Good news for the Fire Lord.","The Fire Nation's greatest ''threat'' is just a little kid.","You mean the Avatar?","''Retired'' general.","Our ship is being repaired.","Yes.","I will do that.","It was incredible!","What?","Did we crash or something?","Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.","We would be honored to join you.","Do you have any ginseng tea?","It's my favorite.","Eh.. My fault, entirely.","More tea, please.","Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?","Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko.","They are your greatest weapons.","Basics, Zuko!","Break his root!","No, Prince Zuko.","Do not taint your victory.","So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat?","Disgraceful.","Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you.","Thanks again for the tea.","It was delicious.","Of course.","I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.","Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it.","Don't get too upset.","Okay then.","We have no idea where he is.","You really should open a window in here.","Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.","Are you going to finish that?","Over here!","You look tired, Prince Zuko.","Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?","You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little.","The temperature's just right.","I heated it myself.","Very well!","Who's there?","A meadow vole!","I should have known.","You startled me, little one.","It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.","Where are you taking me?","Right, but where, specifically?","Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.","I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se.","After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired.","And I'm still tired.","Nothing.","Actually, there is a bit of a problem.","My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose.","That's right.","The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists.","It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.","Excellent form, Prince Zuko.","Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched.","Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!","Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord ''banished you''?","What if you're caught?","You give him too much credit.","My brother is not the understanding type!","Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?","Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters.","Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.","Please Prince Zuko!","If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do!","Do not follow the Avatar.","We're on a collision course!","Because he wants to follow you.","He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.","Actually, someone did.","I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.","Even more urgent.","It seems, I- -I have lost my lotus tile.","For my Pai Sho game.","Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.","See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value.","Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.","Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life.","I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.","I've checked all the shops on this pier.","Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.","Quite the contrary.","I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!","For music night on the ship.","Now, if we only had some woodwinds.","Oh, this place looks promising!","Oh, that is handsome!","Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?","Yeah, it kind of is.","Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?","It's no proverb!","Maybe it should be a proverb ...","Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this.","That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!","There is a storm coming.","A big one.","A storm is approaching from the north.","I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.","He doesn't mean that.","He's just all worked up.","Lucky guess.","Do you really want to know?","It's okay.","May I join you?","Try to understand.","My nephew is a complicated young man.","He has been through much.","Prince Zuko, what's wrong?","You're not missing anything, trust me.","These meetings are dreadfully boring.","Very well.","But you must promise not to speak.","These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?","Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out.","And there were dire consequences.","After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him.","He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect!","And there was only one way to resolve this.","When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.","It was no accident.","After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness.","As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar.","Only then could he return with his honor.","Things will never return to normal.","But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.","Look!","Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.","Your apology is accepted.","Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho!","Zhao has been promoted?","Well, good for him!","Excellent!","I take the pot!","But you're all improving!","I'm certain you will win if we play again.","Is everything okay?","It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.","Don't give up hope yet.","You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.","Where have you been, Prince Zuko?","You missed music night!","Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.","Aahh!","See Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being.","He means no offense!","I'm certain you bathe regularly!","Plus, we'll pay your weight in ''gold''.","You got it!","At my age, there's really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.","June!","No!","Shhh.","Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Four seasons ... four loves ... Four seasons ... for love.","No, it's about our plans.","There's a bit of a problem.","I'm afraid so.","He's taking everyone ... even the cook.","No!","Just rumors.","I don't think he is real.","The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.","It's a lovely night for a walk.","Why don't you join me?","It would clear your head.","Or just stay in your room and sit in the dark.","Whatever makes you happy.","Zuko!","Zuko ...","The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.","Yes ... pirates.","We had a run-in with them a while back.","They wanted revenge.","Yes, I accept.","It will be an honor to serve as your general.","To the Fire Nation!","Our plan is working perfectly.","Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.","No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup.","Someone's coming.","Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours.","Good luck.","Be careful what you wish for, Admiral.","History is not always kind to its subjects.","I hope not, for your sake.","We'll be landing soon.","Do you have a plan?","It's almost twilight, Admiral.","As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack.","The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight.","You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak.","If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.","I'm sorry.","I just nag you, because ... well, ever since I lost my son ... ...","I think of you as my own.","Remember your breath of fire.","It could save your life out there.","And put your hood up.","Keep your ears warm!","I don't need to remind you we have a time limit.","If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable.","Remove the moon?","How?","What?","Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!","He is right Zhao.","You have been touched by the Moon Spirit.","Some of its life is in you.","I'm surprised Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.","Then you should rest.","A man needs his rest.","This is what I've been missing.","Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water, and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense?","I see.","It's the anniversary, isn't it?","Look at these magnificent shells!","I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.","To what do we owe this honor?","I'm sure your brother simply needs a moment.","It ''is'' unbelievable.","I have never known my brother to regret anything.","I care about you!","And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.","Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem.","Wait!","Don't leave without me!","Family sticks together, right?","I think we're safe here.","You're looking at the rare white dragon bush.","Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking.","That, or it's the white jade, which is poisonous.","Hmm ... delectable tea?","Or deadly poison?","Zuko, remember that plant I thought might be tea?","I did ... and it wasn't.","When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing.","But look what I found.","These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade.","That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness.","But where are we going to go?","We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation.","But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.","Whoops!","Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior.","Where do you live exactly?","Thank you for the duck.","It was excellent.","Much practice.","Junior, where are your manners?","You need to thank these nice people.","What are you doing?","These people just showed you great kindness.","Spare coins for weary travelers?","The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile!","Not professional anyway.","It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty!","They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se!","Where did you get these?","Mmmm ... ... mmmm!","Looks like you did some serious shopping.","But where did you get the money?","To be honest with you , the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.","I know we've had some difficult times lately.","We've had to struggle just to get by.","But it's nothing to be ashamed of.","There is a simple honor in poverty.","Zuko ...","Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems.","Not now.","No, Zuko!","You must never give in to despair.","Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.","In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself.","That is the meaning of inner strength.","You did?","Good, good.","Wait!","If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold.","I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first!","Ow ... That really hurt my tailbone.","Here is your tea.","You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.","Perhaps I am.","I wasn't thinking that.","I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.","You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support.","There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you.","Not that I love you, I just met you.","I've been tracking him actually.","I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there.","My pleasure.","Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.","I'm glad.","Get up!","My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.","Somehow, that's not so surprising.","Good.","That was very ... uhhh ... bracing.","No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down.","It's time to resume your training.","Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression.","It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is.","Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire.","It is precise and deadly, like Azula.","To perform the technique requires peace of mind.","Oh yeah, good point!","I mean, yes.","There is energy all around us.","The energy is both yin and yang.","Positive energy and negative energy.","Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies.","This creates an imbalance.","The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning.","Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it.","You are simply its humble guide.","Breathe first.","I was afraid this might happen.","You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.","Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.","Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source.","True humility is the only antidote to shame.","I have another idea.","I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself.","Fire is the element of power.","The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want.","Earth is the element of substance.","The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong.","They are persistent and enduring.","Air is the element of freedom.","The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom.","Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!","Water is the element of change.","The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things.","They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.","It is important to draw wisdom from many different places.","If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.","Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.","It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful.","But it can make you more powerful, too.","You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.","Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy.","A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them.","I learned a way to do this with lightning.","If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it.","You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach.","The stomach is the source of energy in your body.","It is called the sea of chi.","Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean.","From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm.","The stomach detour is critical.","You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly.","You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this.","Now, are you focusing your energy?","Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?","Come on, you've got to feel the flow.","Excellent!","You've got it!","What, are you crazy?","Lightning is very dangerous!","Yeah!","But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you!","If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!","No please, don't stop just for me!","What now?","Colonel Mongke!","What a pleasant surprise!","Sure.","Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary.","Each one is a different kind of weapon specialist.","They are also a very capable singing group.","Would you like some tea first?","I'd love some.","How about you, Kahchi?","I make you as a jasmine man.","Am I right?","It's nice to see old friends.","Hmmm ... Old friends that don't want to attack me ...","So do we.","Ah, this is interesting.","I think I found our friend.","I don't think this is a gamble.","May I have this game?","Those who do can always find a friend.","I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.","He is.","Just watch.","You must forgive my nephew.","He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.","One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.","I'm afraid it's members only.","Wait out here.","Everything is taken care of.","We're heading to Ba Sing Se.","We can hide in plain sight there.","And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation.","Even I couldn't break through to the city.","Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace ... as a tourist!","What sort of king is he eating like?","So, Smellerbee.","That's an unusual name for a young man.","Oh, now I see.","It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!","It is a magnificent sight.","Once.","When I was a ... different man.","That's very noble of you.","I believe people can change their lives if they want to.","I believe in second chances.","It's pronounced Mushi.","Uh, no, no.","But may I just say you're like a flower in bloom.","Your beauty is intoxicating.","Ooh!","Jasmine please.","Blaugh!","Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it!","What a disgrace!","Hey!","I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ... it's just so sad!","What a handsome baby.","I just want our place to look nice, in case someone brings home a lady friend!","Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.","Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we start this afternoon!","Uh, does this possibly come in a larger size?","Blech!","This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!","How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?!","We'll have to make some major changes around here.","Would you like a pot of tea?","\"Sick of tea?\"","That's like being sick of breathing!","Have you seen the spark rocks to heat up the water?","I borrowed our neighbors'.","Such kind people.","The secret ingredient is love.","Please, son, you're confused!","You don't know what you're doing!","This poor boy is confused.","We're just simple refugees.","Oh, ho, ho.","That's very sweet.","No, it's not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion.","The moon flower likes partial shade.","Leaves from the vine, falling so slow.","Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam.","Little soldier boy, come marching home.","Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.","It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and seek to restore honor.","But not this time.","Run!","What are you doing?","With that stance?","With a poor stance, you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over.","With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat.","Much better!","But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type.","Of course!","While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.","Happy birthday, my son.","If only I could have helped you.","Leaves from the vine, falling so slow.","Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam.","Little soldier boy, come marching home.","Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.","You're right, Zuko.","I've seen that girl in here quite a lot.","Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.","He'd love to!","How was your night, Prince Zuko?","Uh, it's nothing.","Go back to sleep.","You did the right thing.","Letting the Avatar's bison go free.","Zuko!","You're burning up.","You have an intense fever.","This will help cool you down.","You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea.","Your critical decision.","What you did beneath that lake.","It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body.","You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew.","It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.","It's jook.","I'm sure you wouldn't like it.","Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow.","Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop?","Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you.","I am very thankful.","No.","I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me.","It means more than you know.","Yes, let's make some tea!","I'm brewing as fast as I can!","I ...","I can't believe it!","Great news!","We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King!","Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.","But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror.","Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea.","Destiny is a funny thing.","Maybe the Earth King overslept.","Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname \"The Dragon of the West\"?","It's more of a demonstration, really.","Come on!","You'll be fine!","I need your help.","May I come in?","Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.","She has captured my nephew as well.","I know how you must feel about my nephew.","But believe me when I tell you that there is ''good'' inside him.","I brought someone along who might help us.","None taken.","The key to both is proper aging.","What's on your mind?","Perfection and power are overrated.","I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.","I don't know the answer.","Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel.","You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, you will come to a better place.","Zuko, it's time we talked.","Go help you other friends.","We'll catch up with you.","You're not the man you used to be, Zuko.","You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been.","And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny.","It's time for you to choose.","It's time for you to choose good.","The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.","Zuko, I am begging you.","Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want.","You've got to get out of here!","I'll hold them off as long as I can!","No.","He wasn't.","You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko.","Sozin was your father's grandfather.","Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.","Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself.","Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko.","It is your nature, your legacy.","But, there is a bright side.","What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by ''you''.","Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation.","Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore ''balance'' to the world.","This is a royal artifact.","It's supposed to be worn by the Crown Prince.","Thank you, Ming.","Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me.","Thank you, Ming.","Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable.","I think you should take the rest of the day off.","You don't look well.","Maybe you should go home and rest.","Trust me.","It is better that you are not here this afternoon.","What a stunning view.","You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years.","The chances of finding him here are ''very'' slim.","Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment.","You should take some time to heal and rest.","You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing.","You never know how things are going to work out.","But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.","I was never angry with you.","I was sad because I was afraid you had lost your way.","But you found it again.","And you did it by yourself.","And I am so happy you found your way here.","Hmmm ... No, Zuko, it won't turn out well.","Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that I could, it would be the wrong way to end the war.","History would see it as just more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother to grab power.","The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.","No.","Someone new must take the throne.","An idealist with a pure heart and unquestionable honor.","It has to be ''you'', Prince Zuko.","Sozin's Comet is arriving, and our destinies are upon us.","Aang will face the Fire Lord.","When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se.","Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it ''back'' from the Fire Nation, so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.","Yes.","Zuko, you must return to the Fire Nation, so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order.","But Azula will be there, waiting for you.","Not alone!","You'll need help.","What do you think it is?","After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop, and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day.","Goodbye, everyone.","Today, destiny is our friend.","I know it.","Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power.","Hey, my belly's not that big anymore.","I've really trimmed down.","Tell her we will be arriving in three days' time.","And that I look forward to winning back Republic City, together.","Hmm ... Amon had to know we were coming.","So why aren't we meeting any resistance?","Something's not right.","It's a trick!","Water and earthbenders, detonate those mines!","What is that sound?","Avatar Korra?","You saved my life.","Thank you.","I was prepared to deal with Sato's mecha tanks, but not these new high-speed aircraft.","Amon is winning so far, but we're not out of the fight yet.","A second wave of reinforcements is on the way, but I need to warn them.","Do you still have a way to get a message out?","Commander Bumi.","Second division of the United Forces.","Yes, bit of a wild man, but the bravest commander you'll ever meet.","Fleet ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft.","Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal.","Do not approach city until you receive the all clear.","Now comes the hard part.","We need to ground those aircrafts.","Otherwise, Bumi's fleet would never be able to retake the city.","Everyone get ready, we leave at dawn.","That's not a good plan.","We need to stick together.","Korra, this is not a mission you should be handling alone.","Hmm ... My grandfather would respect the Avatar's instinct.","So will I. I think we've found our secret airfield.","Bolin, once we get down there, I need you to tear up those runways.","We can't let those aircraft take off.","I don't suppose you know how to metalbend?","Thanks for looking out for me, Aang.","What can I do?","I see.","Well, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some ''routine'' training maneuvers.","And let's say we were to ''accidentally'' run into a hostile Northern blockade.","We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?","Mr. President.","Of course not, sir.","Crystal, sir.","I'm sorry.","My hands are officially tied.","But you should talk to the Fire Lord.","My mother and grandfather have ''always'' been good friends with the Avatar, and the Southern Water Tribe.","I'm sure they'll be willing to help.","You two look lost.","Maybe I can help you.","I was good friends with Avatar Aang.","Hello, Korra.","I'm glad you came to visit us in the Spirit World, Korra.","You came just in time.","We're having a little tea party, to celebrate May-Jim's wedding.","The Spirit World is very mysterious, but so is love.","Help yourself to some tea and cakes.","They are spirit cakes, so you won't gain any weight- of course, you won't lose any either!","That's right.","It was yours long, long ago.","When you were Avatar Wan, you used it to carry the light spirit, Raava, around- until the two of you became one.","It is my favorite thing I found here.","You know, when you make tea in it, you can still taste a little light in every cup.","They say that the game of Pai Sho was invented by the spirits ... although some of them don't seem to grasp it very well.","As you can see, it is a game that requires great patience.","But time does not mean much to us here.","Oh, I've been here for many years.","I had always enjoyed the company of the spirits, so when my work was done in the material world, I chose to leave my body behind and come to the Spirit World!","It can be a wonderful place, and I've made so many friends.","Korra, what's wrong?","You're not alone Korra, it's okay.","Korra, please stop!","Look at what you're doing to everyone!","In the Spirit World, your emotions become your reality- especially for the Avatar, because ''you'' are the bridge between the two worlds.","You must try to stay positive.","There, you see?","Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it.","But if you look for the dark, that is all you will ever see.","I'm afraid finding her won't be so easy.","Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.","This little fellow needs to go home as well.","Maybe if you help him find his friends, you will be able to find yours.","The dragon bird nest is located there, at the top of Hai-Riyo Peak.","This is something that you must do on your own.","The people who have been coming to the Spirit World lately have brought darkness and anger.","So that is what you see now.","But you have light and peace inside of you.","If you let it out, you can change the world around you.","Besides, look at this little fellow.","This mountain is his home.","When you first met him, you were frightened.","But does he seem scary to you now?","Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine light on them.","It was good to meet you.","Come visit me again - in this life, or the next.","Almost forty years.","It's nice to see you again.","My friendly spirit fox told me you were lost, I came to show you the way out.","I'm sorry to hear that.","But you shouldn't be here, Vaatu has escaped and darkness threatens to take over.","I understand.","But I beg you to be careful, if you travel too deep into the Spirit World, you could end up in a place where only the lost will ever find you.","Yes, Mr. President.","But I need to know what kind of enemy we're dealing with.","Fire!","Please don't hurt me, Korra.","I'm just an old man.","I was just out searching for a new teapot to add to my collection.","But instead, I found you.","In the Spirit World, you always seem to find something you don't know you were looking for.","You look troubled.","Sit.","What is on your mind?","Just because you are the Avatar, doesn't mean you will have all the answers.","You know, Zuko and Aang were close friends.","Yes, my nephew.","Their relationship started off a little rocky, but they grew to become lifelong friends.","Best friends.","Mister President, do I have your order to engage?","Get back to the city before she sees you.","And Korra -- --find a way to beat that thing."]},"Aang":{"combined_dialog":["I need to ask you something ...","Please ... come closer.","Will you go penguin sledding with me?","What's going on here?","I'm not sure.","Appa!","Are you all right?","Wake up, buddy.","Ha, ha!","You're okay!","This is Appa, my flying bison.","Don't worry, it'll wash out.","So do you guys live around here?","I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo!","I'm Aang.","Really?","It felt higher than that.","Sure am!","Well, if you guys are stuck, Appa and I can give you a lift.","Okay, first time flyers, hold on tight!","Appa, yip-yip!","Come on, Appa.","Yip-yip!","Appa's just a little tired.","A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky.","You'll see.","Oh, I was smiling?","Hey.","What'cha thinkin' about?","Oh, no.","I didn't know him.","I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't.","Sorry.","Sleep tight.","Uh, why are they all looking at me like that?","Did Appa sneeze on me?","Extinct?","It's not for stabbing!","It's for airbending.","Not magic, airbending.","It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.","Check again!","You're a waterbender?","See?","Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!","Wow!","''Everything'' freezes in there!","What war?","What are you talking about?","Penguin!","Hey, come on little guy.","Wanna go sledding?","Heh heh.","I have a way with animals.","You got a deal!","Just one little problem ...","I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.","Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?","This isn't right.","A waterbender needs to master water.","What about the North Pole?","There's another Water Tribe up there, right?","Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.","But you forget, ''I'' have a flying bison.","Appa and I can ''personally'' fly you to the North Pole.","Katara, we're going to find you a master!","Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me catch one of these penguins?","Hi hi hi!","Ha, ha, ha!","You still ''are'' a kid!","Whoa!","What is ''that?''","If you want to be a bender, you ''have'' to let go of fear.","Okay, back up.","I have friends ''all over'' the world, even in the Fire Nation.","I've

get to meet you.","Huh?","What's that you said about booby traps?","Uh oh ...","Hold on tight!","Yeah.","We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well -- -- we booby-ed right into it.","Don't blame Katara.","I brought her there.","It's my fault.","You should try it sometime.","I am?","Great!","Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.","Thanks for penguin sledding with me.","Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders.","Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years.","Not looking forward to ''that.''","It was nice meeting everyone.","Come on Appa, you can do it.","Yip-yip!","I'll miss you, too.","Come on, boy.","Hey, Katara.","Hey, Sokka.","Looking for me?","Well, you're just a teenager.","If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?","Don't worry, Katara.","It'll be okay.","Take care of Appa for me until I get back.","So, I guess you've never fought an airbender before.","I bet I could take you ''both ''with my hands tied behind my back.","You haven't seen my staff around, have you?","Thanks anyway!","Sorry!","My staff!","Appa!","Hey, Katara.","Hey, Sokka.","Thanks for coming.","I dropped my staff.","I don't know.","I just sort of ... did it.","And how am I going to do that?","That's what the monks told me.","We can learn it together!","All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some ''serious'' business to attend to.","Here, here and here.","Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas.","Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.","Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys.","They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!","Wait 'til you see it, Katara!","The Air Temple is one of the most ''beautiful'' places in the world!","That's ''why'' I'm so excited!","I know, but I need to see it for myself.","Wake up, Sokka!","Air Temple, here we come!","Sokka!","Wake up!","There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!","Great!","You're awake!","Let's go!","Oh.","That was food?","I used it to start the campfire last night.","Sorry.","The Patola Mountain range!","We're almost there!","What about 'em?","Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all.","They probably escaped!","You don't understand, Katara.","The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison!","Right, Appa?","Yip yip!","There it is.","The Southern Air Temple.","We're home, buddy!","We're home.","So that's where my friends and I would play airball, and over there is where the bison would sleep, and ... Aang, seven!","Sokka, zero!","Okay!","What is it?","Nice one!","But enough practicing, we have a whole temple to see!","Hey guys!","I want you to meet somebody!","Monk Gyatso!","The greatest airbender in the world.","He taught me everything I know.","Hmm ...","This whole Avatar thing, m-maybe the monks made a mistake.","But Gyatso?","How do I know if I'm ready for this?","Who is it?","All right.","Yeah.","The air temple sanctuary.","There's someone I'm ready to meet.","It's not impossible.","I survived in the iceberg for that long.","Katara, whoever's in there might help figure out this Avatar thing!","The key, Sokka, is airbending.","Hello?","Anyone home?","I'm not sure.","But it feels like I know them somehow.","Look!","That one's an airbender.","That's the Avatar Cycle.","Wow!","There are so many!","Huh?","That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.","I'm not sure.","I just know it somehow.","Lemur!","Don't listen to him.","You're going to be my new pet.","Hey!","Come back!","Come on out, little lemur!","That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.","Firebenders?","They were here?","Gyatso.","I'm sorry.","But you were right.","And if the firebenders found this temple, that means they found the other ones, too.","I really am the last airbender.","How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?","Looks like you made a new friend Sokka!","Hey, little guy!","Momo.","Well ...","I know it's near water.","Momo, marbles please.","Hey Katara, check out this airbending trick!","You didn't even look.","But I'm not doing it now.","Relax, Sokka.","Where we're going, you won't need any pants.","But Appa's tired, aren't you boy?","I ''said, ''aren't you boy?","Look!","That's why we're here.","Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it.","Katara, you've got to watch me!","Cold!","Hahaha, hahaha!","Oh man ... Whaaaahh!","Aaaah!","Whaaaahh!","I don't know.","It's my fault.","I'm sorry we came here.","I wanted to ride the elephant koi.","This island is named for Kyoshi?","I know Kyoshi!","I know her because I'm the Avatar.","That's me!","Now ... check this out!","All right!","Dessert for breakfast!","These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!","Mmm ... Katara you've got to try these!","Sokka, what's your problem?","''Eat!''","What's he so angry about?","It's great here.","They're giving us the royal treatment!","I'm sure we'll be fine.","Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town?","They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!","Come on, you know me better than that.","I'm just a simple monk.","There she is, girls.","Me in a past life.","Excuse me for a second, ladies.","Actually, I can't right now.","I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa.","Why don't you come with us?","It'll be fun!","Well, neither does carrying your basket.","Just a second, Koko!","It didn't.","You know what I think?","You just don't want to come because you're ''jealous.''","Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.","It ''is'' a little ridiculous, but I understand.","Katara, remember how Unagi almost got me yesterday?","Well, I'm gonna go ride it now.","It's gonna be ''real'' dangerous.","You're not going to stop me?","I know it's great.","I'm glad you're glad.","Fine!","Where're you going?","Don't leave!","Katara!","You showed up!","Back there you acted like you didn't care.","Me too.","I did let all that attention go to my head.","I was being a jerk.","On my way!","Katara ... don't ride Unagi.","Not fun.","Hey!","Over here!","Look what I brought to this place.","Yes, it is.","These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.","I'll call Appa.","Appa, yip yip!","I know, I know.","That was stupid and dangerous.","The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!","I used to always come here to visit my friend Bumi.","Well let's go, slow pokes.","The real fun's inside the city!","So what am I supposed to do?","Grow a mustache?","Now let's get to skippin', young whipper-snappers.","The big city awaits!","You guys are going to love Omashu.","The people here are the friendliest in the world.","Good idea!","Earthbending brings the packages up, and gravity brings them down.","They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes.","Um ...","The mail system?","A package-sending system?","Bumi, you're a mad genius!","I'm on it!","Yeah!","Good idea!","That'll make us go even faster!","Sorry!","Two cabbages please.","Thanks, but I don't eat meat.","I'm from ... Kangaroo Island!","Okay, you caught me.","I'm the Avatar.","Doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe.","Everything checks out.","No firebenders here.","So, good work, everybody!","Love each other, respect all life, and don't run with your spears.","We'll see you next time!","He did say it was newly refurbished.","The air vents!","''We'' can't, but Momo can!","Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!","Go on, boy, get Appa!","I ... guess it's fine.","Really?","I don't have time for your crazy games!","Give me my friends back!","We're leaving!","There!","Enjoy your lunch!","I want my friends back ''now''!","Okay!","Found him!","Come here, Flopsie.","Huh?","Flopsie, wait!","Flopsie!","Flopsie!","Wait a minute.","Flopsie?","Flopsie!","Guys, are you okay?","Come on!","I'm ready for the next challenge.","So ... you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?","I ... choose ... you.","Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?","That's not fair!","You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.","How am I supposed to know his name?","Yeah?","Okay.","So back to the challenges.","I got a key from the waterfall, I saved his pet, and I had a duel.","Well, everything was different than I expected.","Well, they weren't straight forward.","To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would.","I know his name.","I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges.","As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities.","Bumi, you're a mad genius.","Thank you for your wisdom, but before we leave, I have a challenge for you.","Great, you're back!","What's for dinner?","It's coming from over there!","Let's go meet him!","Hey!","That guy's gotta be running somewhere.","Maybe we're near a village?","And I bet that village has a market!","Great hat!","I'll trade you some nuts for it.","No, she doesn't.","We saw you earthbending.","Thanks.","I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.","You must have ''really'' inspired him.","What?","And ... why would they do that?","Exactly!","That's fun stuff!","Katara, what's wrong?","Maybe she's right.","What do you say, Sokka?","Go hide.","I wish I knew how to make a hurricane!","The warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!","I'm just tossing ideas around.","No, it's not.","Look at the smoke!","I bet they're burning coal.","In other words, ''earth.''","Turns out, clouds are made of water.","Yes, it does.","It's the Avatar's job to protect nature.","But I don't know how to do my job.","Yeah.","A waterbending teacher.","But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar.","Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.","I don't know.","No.","Ow!","Hey, how is that cheering me up?","Thanks, Katara.","Nice to meet you too!","So ... is there something I can help you with?","So, what do you want me to do, exactly?","Right ... that's me.","Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World.","It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!","I have to try, don't I?","Maybe whatever I have to do will just ... come to me.","Hello, Spirit?","Can you hear me?","This is the Avatar speaking.","I'm here to try to help stuff.","The sun has set.","Where are you, Hei Bai?","Well ... spirit ... uhhh ...","I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace.","Okay ... well ...","I guess that's settled, then.","My name's Aang!","I'm the Avatar and I would like to help.","Hey, wait up!","Uhhh ...","Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?","I'm trying to do my job as spirit bridge!","Excuse me, would you please turn around?","I command you to turn around now!","Sokka, go back!","Hang on, Sokka!","Sokka!","I failed.","Katara?","Katara, I lost him.","What?","No, I'm right here!","I'm in the Spirit World!","I'll figure this out, Katara.","I promise.","Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right?","All I have to do is ... figure out what I have to do.","But once I do that, no problem.","Appa!","Hey buddy, I'm right here!","But, I guess you can't see me either.","What am I supposed to do?","Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?","Sokka?","That's definitely not Sokka.","What?","I can't airbend in the Spirit World.","You don't know where Sokka is, do you?","You're Avatar Roku's animal guide!","Like Appa is to me!","I need to save my friend and I don't know how!","Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?","I'll be back, Katara.","Take me to Roku!","Hey, what are you doing?","I don't understand, this is just a statue of Roku.","Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about?","A comet?","When can I talk to him?","It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice!","So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku?","But I can't wait that long!","I need to save Sokka now!","Whoa!","I'm not sure ... You're the spirit of this forest!","Now I understand.","You're upset and angry because your home was burned down.","When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.","Actually, I did have a little help and there's something else.","I need to talk to Roku and I think I found a way to contact his spirit.","There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him.","Yeah, and there's one more problem.","The island is in the Fire Nation.","But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means!","I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice.","That's today!","Thank you for your- Come on boy, we've got a long way to go.","Faster!","I'm on it!","Yeah.","But there's just one little problem.","If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade!","It's the ''only'' way.","This is exactly why I didn't want you to come!","It's too dangerous!","Appa, yip-yip!","Appa, are you okay?","Sokka!","We made it!","There it is!","The island where Roku's dragon took me.","You did it buddy.","Nice flying.","It's almost sundown.","We better hurry!","Great!","I am the Avatar!","I'll hold them off.","Run!","Nope!","Wrong way!","You do?","How?","Did you know Avatar Roku?","Is that how you knew I was coming?","If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?","They were waiting for me.","Thank you for helping me.","Shyu, what's wrong?","Definitely.","They're still locked!","Why, won't, it, open?!","I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.","Wait.","How is Sokka a genius?","His plan didn't even work.","Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years?","The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku.","So why isn't anything happening?","Why isn't anything happening?","I don't know what I'm doing!","All I know is airbending!","Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!","Is it about that vision?","The one of the comet?","What does it mean?","So the comet made them stronger?","But that happened a hundred years ago.","What does the comet have to do with the War ''now''?","But I haven't even started learning waterbending!","Not to mention earth and fire!","What if I can't master all the elements in time?","What if I fail?","But I won't be able to come back to the temple.","What if I have questions?","How will I talk to you?","I'm ready.","Thanks.","Where's Shyu?","It's what Avatar Roku said.","I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.","I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole.","What am I gonna do?","You'd do that?","Yeah!","Don't start without me, boy!","Oh right.","Time to practice waterbending.","You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes.","Like this?","Hey, I'm bending it already!","Well, you had to figure it all on your own.","I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.","So, what's next?","Sorry.","Well, don't stop now!","Keep 'em coming!","So, like this?","Looks like I got the hang of that move!","What else do you got?","Uh, sorry.","I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.","Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka.","I couldn't say no to this whistle!","Sure!","What are curios?","Huh?","Momo's not for sale.","Where did you get a waterbending scroll?","I know how to deal with these guys, Katara.","Pirates love to haggle.","Watch and learn.","Let's say to the price of, one copper piece!","Okay, two copper pieces!","Aye, we be casting off now!","What was that all about, Katara?","Well, well.","Look who's come to their senses.","Told you the haggling would pay off.","No thanks.","Grab on tight!","Just hang on!","I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.","No way!","Good one, Katara.","Well, what's done is done.","We have it, we might as well learn from it.","It's okay Katara.","What's wrong?","No Katara, it isn't.","Yeah, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth.","I'm over here!","Follow my voice!","I'm right here!","Uh, never mind!","I'll find you!","Run!","Katara, you're okay!","A team of rhinos, or two waterbenders.","Sokka, can't you make it go any faster?","Hey, you did the water whip!","Oh no ...","I knew a bison whistle would come in handy!","Thanks Appa.","That's okay Katara.","Good one, Katara.","Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- hey, where's the campfire?","And what happened to the tent?","Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve problems, action will.","Why don't you just switch jobs?","You see that?","Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar.","Come on, Momo, that's fair.","Appa's got five stomachs.","There it is, guys, The Great Divide.","I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding for a hundred years.","Uh, you could ''share'' the earthbender and travel together?","All right here's the deal, you're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across!","Does that seem fair?","Sorry, Appa, you'll have to do this on your own.","To tell you the truth, I'm not sure.","But when have I ever been?","Appa's going to take good care of you 'till we get there.","See you on the other side, buddy!","Yip yip!","Nice bending!","Why'd you do that?","What was that?","We're trapped in this canyon.","Look, sticking together is the only way to- Any ideas?","Enough!","I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen.","We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side.","We'll travel in two separate lines.","Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins.","See if you can find out why they hate each other so much.","Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing.","Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts!","Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts.","I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible.","Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.","Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?","What are you talking about?","Okay, okay I get it!","Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall.","Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.","Guys, focus!","How many times do I have to say it?","Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!","You know, I take it back.","Harsh words aren't so bad!","Is that ... food?","Everyone smuggled food down here?","Unbelievable!","You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day?","You're all awful!","So hungry.","Is that an egg custard in that tart?","Everybody, watch me and do what I do!","Now follow me!","We're riding out of this hole!","Everyone, get off!","Wait a second ... Jin Wei?","Wei Jin?","I know those guys!","Nope, just a regular ball.","That's what the game was called, redemption.","As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell \"redemption\"!","Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true.","But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field.","Good to see you, boy.","Did you miss me?","Well, you know I try.","You could call it luck.","Or you could call it lying.","I made the whole thing up.","Now where is that custard tart?","I'm starving!","Be careful, guys!","Guys?","Gyatso?","I'm okay.","I think I just need some rest.","Look at those clear skies, buddy!","Should be some smooth flying.","I think it's true, Katara.","Swishing means it's ripe.","Maybe we should find some shelter?","Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea.","Look at the sky.","I'm sorry for running away.","Actually, he wasn't.","I don't want to talk about it.","Well, it's kind of a long story.","I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar.","I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall.","I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.","First you got to form the ball, then you got to get on quick.","You kind of have to balance on it like it's a top.","I made it up.","How do you know it's me?","Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!","I just chose them because they seemed fun.","Well, I didn't know how to feel about it.","All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing.","Hey, not bad!","You guys have been practicing!","Great!","What's going on?","But I'm still the same!","Nothing's changed!","So, what?","I can't play?","Oh, okay.","What do you mean?","Hey!","Then, just when I was feeling better, something worse happened.","How could they do that to me?","They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!","I'm sorry I got so mad.","Well, that's not exactly what happened.","I was afraid and confused.","I didn't know what to do.","I never saw Gyatso again.","Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.","And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple.","My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.","The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.","The fisherman was right!","I did turn my back on the world!","You don't know that.","I'm going to find him!","We'll be back soon.","I promise.","Come on, Appa!","The boat!","There!","Hang onto the rope.","He doesn't have to apologize.","Actually, I don't eat meat.","Katara, I think you were right before.","I'm done dwelling on the past.","I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away.","I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it.","Appa!","How's Sokka doing?","I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea.","But I found a map.","There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain.","We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.","Not you too!","That's how Sokka started yesterday.","Now look at him!","He thinks he's an earthbender!","A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too.","I'm going to go find some medicine!","Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.","Keep an eye on them guys.","Hello, I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I ''need'' some medicine for my friends, they have fevers and they were coughing- That's nice.","That's nice.","Are you almost done?","Finally!","Thanks for all your help!","Ow!","Taking the cure to my friends.","What about my friends?","What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?","You're insane, aren't you?","Uh ...","I think you dropped this ... A frog!","I've never hidden from you!","Untie me and I'll fight you right now!","What?","No!","Don't leave, frogs!","My friends are sick and they need you!","Please go back to being frozen!","Who are you?","What's going on?","Are you here to rescue me?","I'll take that as a \"yes.\"","My frogs!","Come back!","And stop thawing out!","Wait!","My friends need to suck on those frogs!","Stay close to me!","Take this.","Jump on my back!","Give me the next one!","You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is?","I miss all the friends I used to hang out with.","Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon.","The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together.","He was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you.","If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?","Suck on these.","They'll make you feel better.","No, I don't think I did.","Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka.","Not tangled.","Woven!","I made you a necklace, Katara.","I thought since you lost your other one ...","I don't see why I can't do both.","You mean, all of you or just your neck?","I mean, because they both look great!","I ... well, uh ...","Thanks.","Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!","Make noise!","He'll run off!","And then run in zig-zags!","Whoa there!","Aunt who?","What do you know?","An umbrella!","Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.","Hello.","Aang.","I guess.","Likewise.","Good luck with that!","Yeah, dumb stuff like that ... Well, I've got to find a bathroom.","Yeah ... when I was in there ... Wow, that's a big crack.","Yeah, yeah, I knew that already.","But did it say anything about a girl?","Yes!","Really?","Thank you, Aunt Wu!","They sure are ...","Some stuff.","You'll find out.","That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny.","Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you.","I like you, but more than normal.","Never mind.","They seem happy, Sokka.","So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?","Well, there's this girl.","You do?","And you're okay with it?","Well, how do I do that?","You can be too nice?","Well, okay ... See you later ... Oh, hey, Katara.","I didn't see you there.","That's okay.","I'm busy with my own stuff.","So ... papaya.","You know me.","I don't really care what I eat.","Maybe aloof isn't my style.","Did you see that?","Excuse me.","Where can a guy find one of those things?","Not just any flower, a panda lily.","I've seen it in action and boy, does it work.","But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love.","Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.","Why should she be wrong about love?","There!","On the rim!","Oh no.","Aunt Wu was wrong.","There's no time to walk!","Grab on!","Hi, Katara.","But she doesn't even charge.","But they ''will'' listen to Aunt Wu!","Well, it's about to become the solution.","We're taking fate in our own hands.","First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.","Shhh!","We don't want anyone to hear us.","Oh, I didn't see you there.","Of course I like you.","Oh, I guess not.","I know what you mean.","Huh?","How did you know?","Oh, thanks ...","I guess.","Clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.","We still can save the village if we act fast.","Sokka has a plan.","If any of you are earthbenders, come with me.","Everyone needs to evacuate!","We'll come for you when it's safe!","By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.","Can I ask you something?","You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you?","You just told me what I wanted to hear.","Hey, look!","A sword made out of a whale's tooth.","So, then what happened?","Who the what now?","Hi, I'm Aang.","Thank you, it's truly an honor to be here.","If there's anything- Yeah, nothing's cozier than dead animal skins.","Hey, I ride animals, too!","There was this one time when I rode a giant eel and I- What's that story?","I can't believe they would leave me.","Uhhh, I know Bato!","It's the map to Sokka and Katara's dad!","Hey everyone!","Sorry I was gone so long.","Yup, but now I'm back.","Sure could go for some delicious sea prunes!","I'm sorry, I'll take care of this.","What's ice dodging?","What does that even mean?","I can't.","No, you can't trust me.","A messenger gave this to me for Bato.","You ''have'' to understand.","I was afraid you would- Okay.","You too.","Guess I should be moving on.","I'm an idiot, Momo.","Looks like we're going alone, guys.","Okay, I get it.","Everybody wants me gone.","Who?","Zuko.","A necklace?","Katara!","You've got something I want.","So ... where do we go?","Don't you want to see your father?","I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara.","Something to remind you ...","Still, just a little trinket.","Maybe something like ... this?","Zuko asked me to be ''sure'' I got it to you.","Sure.","When was the last time you saw your dad?","Sorry.","I didn't mean to bring that up.","I bet we'll find something to eat here, the Fire Day's Festival.","Fire Nation cultural exhibits, jugglers, benders, magicians ...","This would be a great place for me to study some real firebenders.","Hey, a poster of me!","I have to learn firebending at some point and this could be my only chance to watch a master's up close.","You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.","Ready disguises!","Let's go.","Hey, there's some food.","Hey, look at this.","I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.","I gotta learn that trick!","Oh!","Oh!","Me!","Me!","I want to get a closer look.","Awww!","That could've been me.","We gotta help her!","I'm calling Appa.","Appa!","Down here!","Nice touch setting off the fireworks.","You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?","We've gotta go see him!","He can train me!","Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me.","Is that where Jeong Jeong is?","I need to talk to him right away.","What happened?","Can I see Jeong Jeong now?","Why won't he see me?","Wait, how does he know that?","I'm going in, anyway!","Master, I need to learn firebending.","Okay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.","Please, I have to learn.","This could be my only chance.","Wait!","What do I do now?","But what am I concentrating on?","So when do I get to make some fire?","Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?","What?","You brought me up here to breathe?","I've been breathing for hours!","I want you to stop wasting my time!","I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun!","I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!","I thought about what you said, I promise I'll be more patient.","Oh yeah!","I mean, let us begin.","What's going on?","This is the ''worst ''firebending instruction ever!","All he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe!","But I'm ready to do so much more.","I did it!","I made fire!","Now ''that's'' some firebending!","I wonder how that juggler did it.","Katara!","I'm so sorry!","It was an accident!","I was, uh... Katara, I'm so-- I'm sorry, I didn't ...","I'm sorry!","Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready.","I wouldn't listen.","I'm never going to firebend again.","No, never again.","What?","How?","Where?","I have to help him!","Jeong Jeong!","You were Jeong Jeong's student?!","Whoa!","Wild shot!","No self-control ...

You guys are great.","Then how can I prove my innocence?","Right ... evidence.","Ladies and gentlemen ...","I'm about to tell you what really happened.","And I will prove it with facts.","Fact number one.","Uhhh ... Oh, yeah.","You see ...","I have very large feet.","Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue.","But ...","I was in a painting at sunset.","So, there you have it, I'm not guilty.","Hey, everybody!","Avatar Kyoshi here.","So, what just happened?","I said I would face justice, so I will.","Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.","Look!","There's a coupon on the back!","The first lesson is free.","Ehhh, he's not the one.","Excuse me, but where is this earthbending tournament, exactly?","How'd you get them to tell you?","Hey, front row seats!","I wonder why no one else is sitting here.","I don't know.","Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth.","He's just listening to his big muscles.","What do you think, Sokka?","I think she is.","She waited ... and listened.","I will!","I don't really want to fight you.","I want to talk to you.","Please, wait!","Please, listen!","I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you!","Wait!","If we want to find the Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a great place to start.","We need to talk to her.","Do you guys know where she lives?","That's because we're asking about the wrong person.","In my vision, I saw a girl, in a white dress, with a pet flying boar.","Know anybody like that?","A flying boar is good enough for me.","Let's check it out.","That's the flying boar from my vision.","Come on!","How did you know it was me?","Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth.","And then I had a vision in a magic swamp, and - Allow me.","I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first.","Then she must be a great earthbender!","Probably good enough to teach someone else!","Ow!","Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is.","What's ''your'' problem?","Good night, buddy.","That's amazing.","Is that why you became the Blind Bandit?","Then why stay here where you're not happy?","You could come with us.","Go, I'll be okay.","Hit it harder!","I'm sorry, Toph.","Not like her.","Toph!","What are you doing here?","You're going to be a great teacher, Toph.","Okay.","That's not gross, it's just a part of spring!","You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat.","And a great beard!","Sorry!","What is it?","Better safe than sorry.","Should we do something?","Okay, okay, you both need to calm down.","I ... can see that.","I don't think so, Sokka.","That's impossible.","There's no way they could have tracked us.","Maybe we should face them.","Find out who they are.","Who knows, maybe they're friendly.","Appa, yip yip!","Sokka, we'll be okay.","We can't keep flying forever.","So what's our plan?","Appa fell asleep!","Wake up, buddy!","Appa's exhausted.","All right, all right, everyone's exhausted!","Let's just get some rest.","No!","No, she's not blaming you.","What?","You're blaming Appa?","How dare you blame Appa!","He saved your life three times today!","If there's anyone to blame it's you!","You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not.","He is!","Appa's carrying your weight.","He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us!","What did I just do?","I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher.","Now she's gone.","I have a plan.","Toph was right.","The fur was leaving a trail right to us.","But now that he's clean, no more trail.","He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.","I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off-course.","All right, you've caught up with me.","Now, who are you and what do you want?","So what now?","I'm not running.","Zuko!","\"Zuzu\"?","Katara!","Today's the day!","Can you believe it?","After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending!","And this place, it's perfect, don't you think?","Sokka?","Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?","Sorry.","Good morning, Sifu Toph.","Well, if you think I should ...","So what move are you going to teach me first?","Rock-a-lanche?","The Trembler?","Oh, maybe I could learn to make a whirlpool out of land!","Sounds good, sounds good!","Like a rock.","Got it.","I'm ready.","Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle?","Whoa!","Yeah, thanks, Katara!","I guess I just panicked.","I don't know what to say.","I know.","I'm sorry.","No, I don't think I do.","Yeah, that sounds good.","I don't want to talk about it.","I know, I know, I know, I know!","I get it, all right?","I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it.","I don't know why I can't, but I can't.","I guess it's earth.","Thanks, Katara.","''Sifu'' Katara.","As a matter of fact, I don't mind.","I'm happy to share anything I have.","Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ...","It's a delicate instrument!","Meditating here!","We'll find him faster if we split up.","Sokka!","Are you okay?","Hmmm ...","I bet I can airbend you out of here.","I can't ...","I can't do it.","I can't do that either.","It would just be really ... uncomfortable.","Thanks, Sokka.","This whole earthbending thing really has me confused.","There's so much pressure.","Everyone expects me to get it right away.","It puts me in a really awkward position.","If I try, I fail.","If I don't try, I'm never going to get it.","I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.","Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub.","It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in.","What are you doing out here little guy?","Did you lose your mama?","Hey there, we found your cub!","See, we have no problem with you!","We're friendly!","Oh no!","Woo-hoo, look at me!","I won't.","What?","You were there the whole time?","Why didn't you do something?","Sokka was in trouble!","I was in trouble!","You could have gotten him out and helped us get away!","Enough!","I want my staff back!","What?","I can't believe it!","No problem, Sokka!","Hey Katara, look what I can do!","Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now!","The key is being completely rooted.","Physically and mentally unmovable!","Shh!","I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise.","Just watch.","Yeah!","I'm putting an orchestra together.","I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.","I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara.","I've been training my arrow off!","Your turn, Katara.","Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?","Oh, yeah, I've been there.","It's a pristine natural ice spring.","And I usually don't use the word \"pristine\".","It's one of nature's wonders.","Must've changed ownership since I was here.","No worries, I clean up easy.","Thanks, I try.","The Southern Temple.","Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?","Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.","Don't worry, buddy.","I'm not making you go underground ever again.","You can stay out here with Toph.","Nothing.","We just like architecture.","What do you have against humans?","Ow.","Uh, yeah, I'll vouch.","We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit.","You have my word.","Uh ... oh, I know!","Hah!","Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things.","I always knew I was special.","Sokka, where are you going?","Firebenders.","Wow, I got to hand it to you, Sokka.","You picked the best mini-vacation for sure.","Great, you must have broken it.","We had no choice.","Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love.","What are you doing?","We've gotta get back to the surface!","Why are we doing this?","You can't possibly check every single date.","Come on, eclipse.","Where's Appa?","You could've come to get us.","I could've saved him!","You just didn't care!","You never liked Appa!","You wanted him gone!","That's all any of you guys care about, yourselves!","You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!","I'm going after Appa.","Appa!","Appa!","No ... No!","What's the difference?","We won't survive without Appa.","We all know it.","It doesn't matter.","None of those will tell us where Appa is.","I'm awake.","I couldn't sleep.","Appa!","Maybe we can find some sandbenders.","Yeah ... look at the shape.","Momo!","I'm not losing anyone else out here.","You tell me where he is now!","Tell me where Appa is!","So, did you figure out what route we're going to take?","Katara, it's okay.","I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.","So, you guys are headed to Ba Sing Se, too?","Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.","Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports.","That won't be necessary.","Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?","I'm doing fine.","Would everybody stop worrying about me?","I'll talk to the lady for you.","But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen!","You have to make an exception!","What if we gave them our tickets?","But ... Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely.","I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass.","I don't know.","The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it.","Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa.","We need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this path.","You saw what I did out there.","I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself.","I hated feeling like that.","Thank you for your concern, Katara.","I'll distract it.","Katara, get everyone across!","I've been going through a really hard time lately.","But you've made me ... hopeful again.","I thought I was trying to be strong.","But really I was just running away from my feelings.","Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you.","I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can.","I just really need to do this.","I know.","Thank you, Katara.","You ready, Momo?","Sorry Momo, Appa's going to have to wait.","I was, but something stopped me.","Something big.","That.","I'm the Avatar.","Take me to whoever is in charge.","Not needed?","The question is, how are we going to stop that thing?","You're the idea guy.","We'll take it down from the inside.","Where are we going to get something like that?","What are you doing?","Someone's going to hear us!","I don't know how many more of those I have in me.","Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through.","Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike.","Sokka, take a fighting stance.","You've got to be quick and accurate.","Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance.","And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.","His own weight becomes his downfall, literally.","Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow.","Everyone inside that wall.","The whole world is counting on us.","That's enough!","We need to get to the next one!","Whoa!","Guys, get out of here.","I know what I need to do.","This looks like a good spot, Momo.","General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!","What I'd give to be a metalbender.","Momo, get out of here!","Thanks, Momo.","I owe you one.","Now all I need ... Actually, that is what I need for once.","I kind of like that one.","It's such a big city.","This is why I never came here before.","I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live.","Can we see the king now?","If we're going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa.","Nice to meet you, Pong.","You mean, platypus bear?","Gopher bear?","Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty.","Your Momo-ness.","Earth!","Wow, you look beautiful.","Where are they?","Or we could go in as these guys.","Toph said we might pass as busboys!","Where are Toph and Katara?","I don't know what he looks like.","That could be ''anyone''!","You found us!","Sorry.","No, don't shout.","Watch this, everybody!","Greetings, Your Majesty.","This could be the most important thing he's ever heard.","I'll tell them!","I'll make sure everyone knows!","Hey there, fellow.","You look hungry.","What kinda animal is that?","Let's do it!","There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city.","Don't worry, I'm great with animals.","This was so much easier in my head.","Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?","Appa!","Appa!","Appa!","No.","No!","I guess this means we'll always be together.","Always.","I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy.","But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth.","About the conspiracy and the War.","We need to talk to you.","See?","We're friends, Your Earthiness.","Over here.","Well, sir, there's a war going on right now.","For the past one hundred years in fact.","The Dai Li's kept it secret from you.","It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.","Right there!","Appa bit him!","Oh, yeah.","If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real.","I wish it wasn't.","It's still there!","We don't have much time.","There's a comet coming this summer.","Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength.","They'll be unstoppable.","Secret files?","It's from the Eastern Air Temple.","I can't believe it.","There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple.","He says he's a guru.","No, a spiritual expert.","He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey.","He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.","Split up?","We just found Appa and got the family back together!","Now you want us to separate?","Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad.","Katara?","I need to tell you something.","I've been wanting to say it for a long time.","Katara, I- Yeah.","Yeah.","Girls are waiting for us.","Thanks, positive attitude.","You haven't seen your dad in over two years.","You must be so excited!","Don't be nervous.","He's going to be so happy to see you!","Not at all.","I'm ready to master the Avatar State.","I'll do whatever it takes.","See you in a week.","Yip yip!","Uhhh ... hello?","You're Guru Pathik, right?","The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?","In your note, you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State.","How?","Uggh!","It tastes like onion and banana juice!","What are chakras?","So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?","The creek can't flow?","The energy flows!","I'll do whatever it takes.","Water Chakra?","I ran away.","I hurt all of those people.","My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.","I'm never going to firebend again.","I can't.","Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else.","Pickles?","Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?","Because I never wanted to be.","Like the four nations.","We're all connected.","Everything is connected.","This is the last chakra, isn't it?","Let's do this.","What?","Why would I let go of Katara?","I ...","I love her!","Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara?","How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her?","Three chakras ago that was a good thing!","I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.","Okay, I'll try.","Katara's in danger!","I have to go!","I don't know.","In my vision, I just knew she needed help.","Uh ...","I'm great!","It went great with the guru.","I completely mastered the Avatar State.","Yeah.","But, in my vision, I felt so sure she was in trouble.","Okay.","Maybe you're right.","Momo!","Katara ''is'' in trouble!","I knew it!","You guys know each other?","She must have Katara.","Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.","Katara's in trouble.","All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble.","Working together is our best chance.","So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea!","Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this ''great'' power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love.","And I just couldn't.","What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula?","Without the Avatar State, what if I'm not powerful enough?","Saving you, that's what.","There's too many.","I'm sorry, Katara.","What happened?","Oh no!","Momo?","Are you sure?","I feel like I'm dreaming.","Sokka?","Why are we on a Fire Nation ship?","Why is everyone dressed this way?","And why am I the only one who's completely out of it?","I have hair?","How long was I out?","Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda.","Are you mad at your dad or something?","Mmm, a little higher.","Uhhh!","Wow, you're definitely in the right area there.","I went down!","I didn't just get hurt, did I?","It was worse than that.","I was ''gone''!","But you brought me back.","You saved me.","So what now?","Me?","The world thinks I'm dead?","How is that good news?","That's terrible!","No, no, no, no, no.","You have no idea.","This is so messed up!","I'll handle this.","The Avatar is back.","I hate not being able to do anything.","I just can't stand by and do nothing!","Fine.","Well, I am pretty hungry.","Maybe dinner's a good idea.","I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly!","You're right, I don't.","But the problem is, I did fail!","It ''is'' true.","I was in Ba Sing Se.","I was there!","But I lost.","And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good.","And I hate the invasion plan, too!","I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes!","I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord.","But now I know I need to do it alone.","Katara, please!","Just go ... please.","I need to redeem myself.","I need my honor back.","A blockade.","I'm not gonna make it.","I failed.","Roku?","But everyone thinks I'm dead again.","They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war.","I'm letting the whole world down.","I don't know.","You're right.","I won't give up.","I have so much to do.","What about the invasion?","It's okay.","If someone saw it, it would give away my identity.","It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive.","I think I see a cave below.","Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out.","If we get Fire Nation disguises, we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.","I don't know about this.","These clothes belong to somebody.","But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit!","Ta-dah!","Normal kid.","Uh ... your mom's necklace.","I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago.","So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool.","Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, \"stay flamin'\".","Greetings, my good hotman.","Oh, we're going to a meat place?","You guys go ahead.","I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Hotman.","Who, me?","That's right.","Let the molding begin.","Yeah, the colonies, of course.","The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom.","Sorry, ma'am.","Um ...","I have a scar.","It's really embarrassing.","Just \"slob\" is fine.","Or, uh, Kuzon.","We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun.","What monkey?","Wow.","You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.","It was nice meeting you.","I guess I'm just lucky.","I'd love to.","I got invited to play with some kids after school.","I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow.","Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation.","I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai.","And here's one that I made out of noodles!","I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then.","It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace.","We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow.","Flamey-O, hotman!","Fire Lord ... forefathers ... Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah.","Is that a trick question?","The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military.","Sozin defeated them by ambush.","I'll just write down my best guess.","I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist.","I was just dancing.","You do dances here in the homeland, right?","But what about expressing yourself?","Thanks On Ji.","I could show it to you again if you like.","Ah!","Just some dance movements.","Parents?","But- I'm not ready to leave yet.","I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid.","You don't know what it's like, Sokka.","You get to be normal all the time.","Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation.","If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom.","I'm gonna throw them, a secret dance party!","Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork!","Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back.","I know, you got fancier feet than anybody.","And six of 'em!","Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's!","Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving.","This is when you start dancing.","Oh boy.","Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about.","It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.","Sure you do, you have for generations!","It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances.","A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'.","And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'.","And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se.","Yeah, that's it!","That's the sound of happy feet.","All right, go with that!","Everybody freestyle!","Take my hand.","Don't worry about them.","It's just you and me right now.","Uh-oh.","I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all.","Momo!","Oh Momo!","Hahahahaha!","You found me, buddy!","Hey guys, I think this river's polluted.","Hey, maybe we can get food there!","Now you look just like a little hill with horns!","Bye, buddy!","Thanks for the ride!","Let's just get what we need and go.","But we just saw you.","You're even wearing the same clothes.","The only difference is your hat.","I don't get it.","What?","What's the matter Katara?","He doesn't look sick.","You okay, buddy?","His tongue is purple!","That can't be good.","Katara, can you heal him?","Yeah, are the people ... happier?","Is that why this place seems so festive?","Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka.","It's more like ... What's the matter, buddy?","It's her!","Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!","Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule.","Wait!","But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine!","I know Hei Bai!","We're close personal friends!","Heeey!","My name's Aang.","I'm the Avatar.","Yeah, me too.","I hate that.","You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit.","I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive.","You seem familiar too.","No, you ''really'' seem familiar.","Katara?","You're the Painted Lady?","But how?","So you've been sneaking out at night?","Wait, is Appa even sick?","I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people.","No, I think it's great!","You're like a secret hero!","You wanna destroy this factory?","Hey, I just found out this morning!","Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village!","He really does have a heart, doesn't he?","Aha, I knew it!","I knew you were the same guy.","You're the shop owner ''and'' the boat guy.","No, I just saw you!","You switched hats and called yourself a different name!","Not if we can stop it!","Toph, let's make a trench to stop the fire from coming any closer.","Keep an eye on Momo.","Sokka, stand clear!","Good work, everybody.","These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night.","Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time?","I mean, look at Katara's hair, right?","What's up with that?","Nothing.","I was just trying to ... What do you think?","Pretty slick, huh?","All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword.","It's where I get a sword handle and then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade.","Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.","I'll just stick to what I got.","That's it!","That's what you needed all along, Sokka.","Not the sword, a master.","We've all had masters to help us get better.","You should see if you can study with Piandao.","Twice?","How hot is it?","I guess the jokes don't run in the family.","No, we're over on this island.","Sokka!","Say something funny!","The White Lotus.","Huh.","What?","I'm wearing trunks.","Whoa!","Let's go again!","We can't!","Jump on Appa!","I'll try to distract him!","I'm okay.","Okay, Roku.","There it is.","That's Roku's home.","Where're we going?","You don't have to tell me.","Wait, whose party is it?","Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple!","No way!","He's air surfing!","I can't believe I never thought of that.","That's amazing!","I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was!","Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you're alive!","This is amazing, Roku!","You're battling a volcano, and you're winning.","Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it?","Roku?","Roku!","No, that's wrong.","I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all.","Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right?","If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil.","Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance.","And I also think it was about friendships.","I don't see why not.","Okay.","I'm ready for some training.","Are we taking a break?","Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud.","Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me.","Yeah!","So, guys.","What are we gonna get with our last silver piece?","Flamey-O, Toph.","Toph got us money.","She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like.","Katara, I'll personally make you an Avatar Promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams.","Wow, how does it work?","Well.","I, uh- Yes, ma'am.","Sure.","I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.","I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.","I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.","Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?","Where do you think anyone is?","Sokka, watch out!","It's Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man!","We should split up.","He can't chase us both.","I think I like \"the man with a sword for a hand\" better.","All right, now I'm getting scared.","I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.","Helping people ... that's what I do.","She could be home any minute.","Okay, that's pretty creepy.","We shouldn't be doing this.","Guys, I don't know about this ... Great ...","I'd steer clear of the sea prunes.","Close enough.","This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation.","I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.","Excuse me, sir.","Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?","Old Man Ding?","Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?","I didn't know spirits made prisons like this.","Who brought you here?","We have to stop Hama!","Give up!","You're outnumbered!","This feels weird!","It's okay!","Wait!","Four days?","The invasion's in ''four'' days?","I guess.","Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!","I'm bringing you down.","Oh no!","It was just a dream, Momo.","I still have my pants.","Well, I better keep training.","A couple hours.","I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai.","You don't get it, do you?","My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending.","Not even the basics.","Okay, well I still have to work on everything else.","I better spend the whole day training.","Good night, Katara.","Good night, Sokka.","Good night, Toph.","Good night, Appa.","Good night, Momo.","Good night, Appa and Mo- Math test?","Oh no!","I forgot all about the math test!","I've gotta be ready.","But I forgot my pants and my math test.","Sokka, get up!","I needa know what day it is!","Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises.","In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you were too slow and they got you!","Then climb that cliff!","Climb it fast!","Don't drink that!","In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom!","We died because of your tiny bladder.","And you need to start wearing your hair up.","In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-.","You're right.","I'm losing my mind.","It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed.","I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves.","I feel ... really warm.","Like there's this warm feeling all around me.","This heat.","Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me!","And the whole world is being engulfed in flames!","You ''know'' what's bothering me.","I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.","You said it yourself!","He's the baddest man on the planet!","I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world!","Okay!","But what can I do to feel better?","Pound away.","Ow!","Toph ...","I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me!","Thanks for everything, guys.","Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better.","Maybe.","It's the nightmares.","They just get worse and worse.","No.","That won't help.","Nothing helps.","There's only one thing I can do!","I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!","Invasion.","All aboard for the invasion.","I told you, I can't go back to sleep.","Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think.","And I've realized some big things, Katara.","I see everything so clearly now.","What really matters.","Why I'm really doing this.","I'm doing it to save the world.","But more than that.","I'm doing it for the people I love.","I'm doing it for you, Katara.","I'm saying, I love you!","What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time.","Baby, you're my forever girl.","Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream.","Uh, living underwater?","Put 'em up, Fire Lord!","Ozai's defense is impeccable.","I'll have to try a different approach.","You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord?","Momo, did you hear something?","That's more like it.","I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me.","Oh, Momo, let me explain.","Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares.","They were just too much.","Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it.","You guys, come on.","Sokka, what do we do?","About that!","Come on, guys.","We're all on the same side.","I just need to jump in a cold waterfall!","Oh, look.","Another hallucination.","An imaginary bed made out of clouds.","Look!","You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't!","The invasion's tomorrow!","No, Katara!","There's still ''so'' much I haven't learned.","I don't need sleep.","What I ''need'' is practice.","Quick, hit me!","You really think so?","Thanks, guys.","You know what?","I think I am ready.","Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!","No, Fire Lord Ozai.","''You're'' not wearing any pants.","I can't.","When Azula shot me with lightning, my seventh chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe.","Toph, this is Haru.","When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation.","So he had to hide his earthbending.","A new glider!","This is amazing!","Oh ... well, I'm sure that will come in handy.","We've been looking everywhere for you.","The boats are ready to leave.","What?","Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth.","That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that.","Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se.","I won't let myself fail again.","So, this is it huh?","I'm ready.","Katara, I ... You go first.","Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it.","What if ... what if I don't come back?","What do you know?","It ''did'' come in handy.","That's strange.","The Avatar is back!","Hello?","Anyone home?","He wasn't home.","No one was.","The entire palace city is abandoned.","We can still do this.","We can still win the day.","I've gotta try.","Do you feel anything down there?","Stay safe.","We'll be back soon.","How is that careful?","Climb aboard and hold on tight.","Thanks!","I'm ready.","I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.","Where is he?","Where's the Fire Lord?","I can't pin her down!","She's too quick!","Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?","Sokka, she won't talk.","Maybe it's not too late.","The eclipse is over.","But I can face the Fire Lord anyway.","But I'm ready!","I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.","I guess you guys are right.","They've got air power, but so do I!","I'm gonna do what I can to slow them down.","Let's join the others!","They're heading for the beach ...","They're gonna destroy the submarines!","Thank you all for being so brave and so strong.","I'm gonna make this up to you.","I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while.","The Western Air Temple!","Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people.","No, she's right.","We ''are'' here!","Why can't I go?","Fair enough.","So, what's the new plan?","Oh, yeah.","That's great, no problem.","I'll just do that.","Well, it's not even gonna be possible!","Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?","Yeah ... right.","Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.","Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody.","Why don't we just take a nice tour around the temple?","What?","The wind is too loud in my ears!","Check out this loop!","Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table!","Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber!","There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done.","We'll never let you join us.","I kind of have a confession to make.","Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?","Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out.","He risked his life to save me.","You're probably right.","Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple!","I'm'' not ''having Zuko as my teacher!","You what?","But he did firebend at you?","I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right.","After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice.","I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko.","I think you ''are'' supposed to be my firebending teacher.","When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again.","But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love.","I'd like you to teach me.","Not so fast.","I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them.","Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned.","What do you think?","Sokka?","Katara?","Okay.","Not something to fear.","Maybe I need a little more instruction.","Perhaps a demonstration?","I thought it was ... nice.","Maybe it's the altitude.","That one kind of felt hot.","Sorry, Sifu Hotman.","I don't know.","Maybe it isn't.","Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.","That's amazing, Toph!","I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison.","Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy.","Okay, okay.","I'm sorry.","Sun Warriors?","Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid.","It's like the monks used to tell me.","Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.","Appa's right, Zuko.","In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.","Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.","Okay.","We've learned something about architecture.","Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too.","The past can be a great teacher.","Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.","There's probably a lot more.","Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.","Look, this seems promising.","Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending.","I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors.","Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years.","Something you're not telling me.","But I thought your uncle was ...","I don't know, good?","It's locked up!","Monkeyfeathers!","The solstice again?","We can't wait here that long.","Nothing's happening.","You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you.","You're pretty smart.","It says this is something called the Dancing Dragon.","Zuko, get over here!","I want you to dance with me!","Just do it.","Let's follow the steps of the statues.","Don't you see?","These aren't dance moves.","These statues are giving us a lesson.","I think this is some kind of Sun Warrior firebending form.","Hurray!","Wait, what exactly is that?","Well, don't touch it!","Remember what happened out there with those spikes?","I'm just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals.","Oh no, it's another trap!","I can't move!","Zuko, do something!","It stopped.","You ''had'' to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?","Help!","Well, what do you think we should do?","Please, I don't normally play this card, but ...","I'm the Avatar.","Just hear us out.","Ran and Shaw?","There are two of them?","I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.","It's like a little heartbeat.","I can't.","If I walk too fast, my flame will go out.","But what if I can't control it?","But once they find out I'm the Avatar ... We could turn back now.","We've already learned more about fire than we'd hoped.","What if they judge us, and attack us?","Give me some of yours.","I can't.","Quit being stingy!","Uh oh.","Still think we can take 'em?","Zuko, I think we're supposed to do the Dragon Dance with them.","Well, I think they want us to do something.","Let's just try it.","Wow.","Like firebending harmony.","So your uncle lied.","All this time, I thought firebending was destruction.","Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant.","But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life.","With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable.","I like jokes.","Nobody else has homework.","One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ...","Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.","What are you doing?","Zuko!","No!","I can't get him to go in there!","Appa hates tunnels!","We'll have to find a way!","We'll get through.","Let's go.","Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it?","Why?","Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?","Oh.","What's going on?","Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish?","Wait!","Stop!","I do understand.","You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage.","How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa?","How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?","I don't think so.","I think it's about getting revenge.","Katara, you sound like Jet.","The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper.","While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.","Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness.","No, it's not.","It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive.","So you were just gonna take Appa anyway?","It's okay, because I forgive you.","That give you any ideas?","I wasn't planning to.","This is a journey you need to take.","You need to face this man.","But when you do, please don't choose revenge.","Let your anger out, and then let it go.","Forgive him.","Thanks, Sokka.","I appreciate that.","Why do you need Momo?","Katara?","Are you okay?","Zuko told me what you did.","Or what you didn't do, I guess.","I'm proud of you.","You did the right thing.","Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing.","It never is.","I was just, I wanted to ... okay.","Wait, is that a woman playing me?","I don't do that!","That's not what I'm like!","And I'm ''not'' a woman!","Ugh.","Ugh!","At least the Sokka actor kind of looks like you.","That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all!","Argh!","Yeah, that's not you at all.","No, I'm not!","I hate this play!","Overreacting?","If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State right now!","Katara, did you really mean what you said in there?","On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me.","But it's true, isn't it?","We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together.","But we're not.","Why don't you know?","Well, when is the right time?","Ugh, I'm such an idiot!","I'll say.","I'm trying.","Ooh, ooh!","Me, me, me!","Check out my Appa sand sculpture.","Whoa!","Wow, you've even made a little Earth King and Bosco.","Is that a blubbering blob monster?","But it doesn't even look like- Aah!","What are you doing?","Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!","Enough!","About Sozin's Comet ...","I was actually gonna wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.","I'm not ready.","I need more time to master firebending.","What am I gonna do?","Why didn't you tell me about your dad's crazy plan sooner?","This is bad.","This is really, really bad.","Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together, but I wouldn't want to do it any other way.","That's like waterbending.","So, have ''you'' ever redirected lightning before?","What did it feel like?","Well, not ''over'' over.","I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action, am I right?","Oh.","Yeah, I'll just do that.","I can't.","I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right.","I didn't feel like myself.","But he's still a human being.","No, I agree with you.","Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way.","I don't know.","Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.","Do you really think

What about me and my brother?","Aren't you going to invite us?","You don't know who we are, do you?","We'll do our best.","I guess I was intrigued.","I'm so used to people worshiping us.","Yes, I know, and I love it.","But, for once, I just wanted to see how people would treat us if they didn't know who we were.","I heard you telling someone you'd be partying from dusk 'till dawn.","It's dusk, so we're here.","We are the perfect party guests.","We arrive right on time, because we are very punctual.","That's a sharp outfit, Chan.","Careful.","You could puncture the hull of an empire-class Fire Nation battleship, leaving ''thousands'' to drown at sea, because it's so sharp.","Come on, Ty Lee.","You can't be this ignorant.","Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them.","You're not a challenge.","You're a tease.","It's not like they actually care who you are.","Okay, okay, calm down.","I didn't mean what I said.","Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little ... jealous.","Well, you're right about all those things.","But, for some reason, when I meet boys, they act as if I'm going to do something horrible to them.","Well, that sounds really shallow and stupid ... Let's try it.","Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house.","No.","I used to come here years ago.","Your arms look ''so'' strong.","I thought I'd find you here.","Come down to the beach with me.","Come on.","This place is depressing.","Here we go.","Well, that's it, then.","You have a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them, you were shut down.","That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself.","There's a simple question you need to answer, then.","Who are you angry at?","Is it Dad?","Me?","Answer the question, Zuko.","Come on, answer it.","Why?","You're pathetic.","Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone.","Well, yes, I guess you're right.","I don't have sob stories like all of you.","I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care.","My own mother thought I was a monster.","She was right, of course, but it still hurt.","You know what would make this trip ''really'' memorable?","We've got some bad news, Chan.","It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko.","Make sure he gets your good side.","Oh, Zuko, it's so strange how your mind works.","Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course.","He spent his early years secretly preparing for it.","He was as patient as he was clever.","He famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's Comet, and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world.","In the end, he died a very old and successful man.","Didn't you pay ''any'' attention in school, Zuko?","He died peacefully, in his sleep.","He was ancient.","Hello, Zuzu.","If you've come for a royal hair-combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait.","What do you mean?","Of course you're welcome there!","Oh, Zuko.","Don't be so dramatic.","I'm certain Dad wants you there.","You probably just weren't invited because it's so ''obvious'' you're supposed to be there.","Of course!","I'm the princess.","Exactly, so stop acting like a paranoid child!","Just go to the meeting.","So, you are alive after all.","I had a hunch that you survived.","But it doesn't matter.","I've known about the invasion for months.","You mean I'm not good enough for you?","You're hurting my feelings.","Are you sure?","I'm a pretty good liar.","I am a four-hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.","When I left Ba Sing Se I brought home some souvenirs: Dai Li agents!","Not true.","I'm giving it my all.","Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius.","And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes.","It's a trap.","Don't say I didn't warn you.","So, Sokka's your name, right?","My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time.","She was convinced you were going to come rescue her.","Of course you never came, and she gave up on you.","Come and get it.","Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on.","Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left.","I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now.","No, they're too fast.","It doesn't matter.","They'll be back.","''I'' did.","Who is this?","You're wasting your time.","That's not one of them.","Then it's time to leave.","Goodbye, Zuko.","What is she doing?","Leave us alone.","I never expected this from you.","The thing I don't understand is \"Why?\".","Why would you do it?","You know the consequences.","No, ''you'' miscalculated!","You should have feared me more!","Put them somewhere I'll never have to see their faces again, and let them rot!","You mean it's not obvious yet?","I am about to celebrate becoming an only child!","''I'' think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground.","Come on slowpokes!","Faster!","Sorry I'm late, father.","Good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days.","So, is everything ready for our departure?","What?","But I thought we were going to do this together.","You ... you can't treat me like this!","You can't treat me like Zuko!","But it was ''my'' idea to burn everything to the ground!","I deserve to be by your side!","Really?","Fire Lord Azula?","It does seem appropriate, but what about you?","What am I holding?","Correct.","And what day is this?","Yes, it is.","So, please.","Tell me why, on the most important day of my life, you've decided to leave a pit in my cherry?","Small?","Do you realize what could've happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?","Yes, then you will understand the severity of your crime.","Oh very well, since it is a special day, I will show mercy.","You are banished.","Leave this palace immediately.","What are you all looking at?","I have two feet that need scrubbing.","And make sure you get in between the toes.","I won't have my first day as Fire Lord marred by poor foot hygiene.","Actually, everything's not all right!","Do you know how long it took you to get here?","Five, to be precise, in which time an assassin could've snuck in, done away with me and been on his merry way!","Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord?","With tardiness and disloyalty?","And I'm sure that's just what you told Long Feng before you turned against him and joined me!","You're all banished!","Goodbye!","Please send in the next group on your way out!","None of them could be trusted.","Sooner or later, they all would have betrayed me.","Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.","What?","Which one of you just said that?","What a shame ... there's only one way to resolve this.","You two must duel each other.","I order you to fight an Agni Kai!","All right, fine.","Lo, you're banished.","Li, you can stay.","All right hair, it's time to face your doom.","Don't pretend to act proud.","I know what you really think of me.","You think I'm a monster.","Well what choice do I have?!","Trust is for fools.","Fear is the only reliable way.","Even you fear me.","What are you waiting for?","Do it!","You're hilarious.","Wait.","You want to be Fire Lord?","Fine.","Let's settle this.","Just you and me, brother.","The showdown that was always meant to be.","Agni Kai!","I'm

it?","I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang.","I'm with Sweetness.","I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se.","And I can't even see!","I don't trust the new positive Sokka.","Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!?","Can we please buy a new saddle?","Riding bareback is terrifying!","What was that?","How should I know?","I'm still voting we ''leave'' Ba Sing Se.","He has a good point.","It's gone!","First time flying?","Yeah.","I hate it, too.","Long Feng intercepted our letters from home?","That's just sad.","I know what you mean.","My mom's in the city.","And from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.","I'm really gonna miss you guys.","Hello?","Mom?","Anyone home?","Hey!","Who do you think you're dealing with!?","Hey!","Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second?","I got to go to the bathroom!","Let me out of here so I can kick both your butts!","Come on, metal.","Budge!","Wooo!","Toph, you rule.","It's not!","It's the real deal!","I am the greatest earthbender in the world!","Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!","So how did it go with the guru?","Did you master the Avatar State?","There's no one else here.","Wait!","Someone's at the door.","Actually, I know who it is.","It's an old friend of mine.","Glad to see you're okay.","I met him in the woods once and knocked him down.","Then he gave me some tea and some very good advice.","Well, what'd you know?","There ''is'' an ancient city down there.","But it's deep.","They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!","See any Dai Li agents nearby?","That ''is'' a nice trick.","Twinkle Toes!","That's got to be you!","Uh-oh, somebody catch him, he's going to- Hopefully, you won't need to.","They know!","Load the Toph!","How are we doing?","You make it too easy!","Hey, Aang!","We're going into town to find some dinner.","You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you?","Hey!","What's ... oh, it's your glider.","Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in.","Plus, they have real food out there.","Does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers?","Hm ...","I should probably wear shoes.","But then I won't be able to see as well.","Sorry, shoes!","Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender.","Yeah, we got our outfits.","What do you need to go to school for?","Ha ha!","They're coming!","Everyone stop bending.","Who knew Twinkle Toes could dance?","Way to go, dancy pants.","I think you really ''did'' help those kids, you taught them to be free.","Pah!","Plegh!","Too bad your skills aren't ''on'' the hook.","I don't feel anything.","Where is the village?","Hey, loud mouths!","Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about \"taking out the Fire Lord.\"","Finagle away, oh schedule master.","Well ''I'm'' not waking up early.","Forget it!","Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much.","He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.","Is it just me, or does this place seem different?","We need more food.","Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better.","What's going on?","Maybe we can clean the river!","Eh, you've seen nothing once, you've seen it a thousand times.","Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is that we don't get the hero worship anymore.","I miss the love.","I can't read at all!","I learned from badgermoles.","They don't talk, but they're still good teachers.","I'm tapped out.","I already picked my toes, twice.","The first time was for cleaning, but the second time's just for the sweet picking sensation!","Plus, it's so hot today.","You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing.","I miss Sokka.","Sokka's coming!","You're back!","I don't know.","They missed you or something.","I didn't care.","Sweet!","Check this out.","Aang, I know swimming is fun and all, but do you really think you should be exposing yourself like that?","Cover up.","I know.","It's your tattoos I'm worried about.","What if someone sees you?","Guys, you're all gonna think I'm crazy, but it feels like a metal man is coming.","Well, that was random.","Yes, there is.","An entire village, hundreds of houses ... all completely buried in ash.","It's like these people are born bad.","Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?","How could you do this to me?","You betrayed me!","Good job, Twinkle Toes.","Visualize, then attack.","What's the matter?","Can't handle a little dirt, Madame Fussy-Britches?","Hungry for a mud pie?","While Katara cleans up, let's go have some fun!","I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you.","We can get more money.","Right there.","This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage.","Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute.","But I can feel it with my earthbending.","How can I possibly play?","I'm blind.","More interesting?","How?","I'll do it for forty silver pieces.","I won!","Hey!","I only cheated because he was cheating!","I cheated a cheater.","What's wrong with that?","Why?","Because it's fun?","And you hate fun?","Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up?","Yeah!","Maybe!","Maybe then you'd see how great we have it!","I mean, look at us!","We're traveling around the world!","Making easy money!","Having fun!","With no parents to tell us what to do!","Whatever.","I ''do'' hate them.","I'll stop when I wanna stop and not when you tell me!","Well it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper.","A wanted poster!","That's so great!","\"The Runaway.\"","I love my new nickname.","Is there a picture of me?","Does it look good?","Don't be such a worrywart like your sister.","Think of it this way: Now you've got plenty of money to help with the invasion plan.","Here's a little extra, so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation.","You know what?","Make it an atlas.","Of course you do.","And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret.","Yes, we were.","No, I don't.","Yes.","Really.","I don't know!","I mean, seriously!","What is with you people?","I'm ''blind''!","Where did you get that!?","You went through my stuff!","You had no right!","That's a lie!","You're lying, Katara!","Oh really, Mom?","Or what are you gonna do?","Send me to my room?","Well you can't!","Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom!","No, but you certainly act like it!","You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not!","You're just a regular kid like the rest of us!","So stop acting like you can tell me what to do!","I can do whatever I want!","I can't be around you right now!","So lemme guess: You brought me out here to tell me that your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.","Yeah.","I don't know how you could deal with it.","I don't understand.","I guess I never thought about that.","The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing.","She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me.","You know, the real me.","That's more than my own mom.","Don't ever tell her I said any of this!","Katara, stop.","You don't need to apologize.","I was the one being stupid.","These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them.","What?","''You'' wanna pull a scam?","You ''know'' I'm in!","Now what's this idea of yours?","How could you do this to me?","You betrayed me!","Hey!","What kind of cell is this?","Wait!","It's a trap!","Not for us, Katara!","We're the bait!","He wants Aang!","But, this was ''your'' idea.","Katara, you are fun.","If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with.","It's okay.","I was really mad when you said that because ... well because, maybe it's true.","I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them.","I don't know.","I wish we had some earth or water.","We need bendables.","I left it back at camp.","I was worried they would take it.","Um, Katara?","Are you okay?","Well, what are you doing?","Katara!","You're a genius!","A sweaty, stinky genius!","Let's get out of here!","Good job, Sokka.","Now let's get outta here before Combustion Man catches us.","Katara?","I need your help.","I need you to write some things down for me.","I wanna send a letter to my parents.","What are you doing?","Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.","Wait!","Guys, did you hear that?","I hear people under the mountain.","And they're screaming.","No, I'm serious.","I hear something.","It just ... stopped.","Maybe it's treasure!","Ooh!","Hand it over!","I thought they were ocean kumquats.","Maybe the Moon Spirit just turned mean.","Where does Old Man Ding live?","Oh no!","I did hear people screaming under the mountain.","The missing villagers must still be there!","I can hear them.","They're this way!","This is the place.","That's why you have me.","Let's go!","I'll get these people out of here.","You go!","How did you pick this place?","Relax!","It's still two days before the invasion!","Why?","Is it poisoned?","All right!","What you need is a good old-fashioned back pounding to relieve your stress.","Sorry.","I forgot you had baby skin.","Well, there's one other thing we can try.","Acupuncture!","And you're acting downright weird.","Hey!","It's real!","We spent ''hours'' working on it.","You want me to do it?","You're the man, Twinkle Toes!","So, what's your strategy for taking him down?","Gonna get your glow on and hit him with a little Avatar State action?","You know what I just heard?","Blah, blah, spiritual mumbo jumbo blah, blah, something about space.","No way!","Is that- You guys here for a rematch?","Sweet.","Yeah, congratulations, Sokka.","You managed to invent a worse way of travel than flying.","I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, Twinkle Toes.","If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, I'm just the girl to find it.","Yep.","There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano.","There is something big, dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano.","This way!","That one's a dead end!","Perish in burning hot magma.","The tunnel continues on the other side and It leads right to the bunker.","Not a problem.","And stick to the truth.","I'll be able to tell if you're lying.","You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!","I'll roll your whole head!","It's not your fault, Sokka.","Azula was ready for us.","She had every move planned out.","The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time.","We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't.","It just wasn't our day.","What we need to do now is go and help our friends.","Hey, we're here!","I can feel it!","Wow ... it's amazing!","Who's ... oh, never mind.","If it's important I'll find out.","What's up with him?","I think that'll have to wait.","You want to ''what'' now?","Appa does seem to like him.","That guy locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us all up!","Actually, he wasn't lying.","I'm just saying that, considering his messed-up family and how he was raised, he could have turned out a lot worse.","All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere.","Maybe you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly.","Because Katara, you're all ignoring one crucial fact: Aang needs a firebending teacher!","We can't think of a single person in the world to do the job!","Now one shows up on a silver platter, and you won't even think about it?","Ergh!","I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one around here!","It's me!","Ow!","You burned my feet!","Get away from me!","Get off me, get off me!","My feet got burned!","I just told you, my feet got burned!","Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night.","I thought he could be helpful to us.","And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out.","Well, he did, and he didn't.","It was sort of an accident.","Yes.","Yeah, me too.","Maybe just invite him back here.","He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once.","Ahhh, that's the stuff.","Now I know how the rest of you guys feel.","Not being able to see with your feet stinks.","He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side!","Go ahead and let him join.","It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.","Don't look at me, I didn't touch your stuff.","Ouch.","You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source.","I recommend the original source.","No.","Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is.","I don't know.","For earthbending, the original benders were badgermoles.","One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave.","That's where I met them.","They were blind, just like me.","So we understood each other.","I was able to learn earthbending, not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses.","For them, the original earthbenders, it wasn't just about fighting.","It was their way of interacting with the world.","Bring it!","It's nice to get a chance to relax a little.","It hardly ever happens.","What does it say?","Did you at least get some good meat?","Seriously?","You guys didn't find ''any'' meat?","Come on!","We can get out through here!","I can clear that away and we can fly out through there!","Why are we sitting in the nosebleed section?","My feet can't see a thing from up here!","I think he's got you pegged!","Oh man!","This writer's a genius!","Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes!","I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys.","Listen friends, it's obvious that the playwright did his research.","I know it must hurt, but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth.","This is it, this must be where I come in! ''","Here it comes ...","Wait a minute, '' I sound like a guy.","A really buff guy.","Are you kidding me?","I wouldn't have cast it any other way!","At least it's not a flying bald lady!","Geez, everyone's getting so upset about their characters.","Even you seem more down than usual, and that's saying something!","Yeah, that's pretty great!","You have redeemed yourself to your uncle.","You don't realize it, but you already have.","Because I once had a long conversation with the guy, and all he would talk about was you.","Yeah, and it was kind of annoying.","But it was also very sweet.","All your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path, and see the light.","Now you're here with us.","He'd be proud.","That's how I show affection.","You said it.","Not bad, baldy, but I've been working on my sandbending.","You're gonna love this.","Try and top ''that'', Sokka.","Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.","And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too.","Yeah, if we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down.","Yeah.","Uh ... what about me?","So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?","Sweetness.","Mwah-ha-ha-ha!","I am not Toph.","I am Melon Lord!","Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!","I knew it!","You did have a secret thing with Haru!","No, it's not.","Where's Aang?","Come on, lazy bones, let's go.","I bet he ran away again.","Then what do ''you'' think happened to him, oh sleuthy one?","I'm going with Zuko!","What?!","Everyone else went on a life-changing field trip with Zuko.","Now it's my turn.","And then when I was nine, I ran away again.","I know I shouldn't complain.","My parents gave me everything I ever asked for, but they never gave me the one thing I really wanted, their love.","You know what I mean?","This is the worst field trip ever.","Hey, wait a minute.","Has anyone noticed that Momo is missing, too?","Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar ... it's you.","I don't know who this June lady is, but I like her.","We know he's gone.","That's why we're trying to find him.","Helpful.","Real helpful.","I think it's kind of sweet.","Huh?","What's going on?","We're surrounded by old people.","Well, that's who we're looking for.","You mean the Fire Lord.","Well, what if Aang doesn't come back?","And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us.","Too bad the Fire Lord's about to use it to destroy the world.","Then we're taking off, too!","Where's the closest airship?","That's how it's done!","That's a great idea!","Let the blind girl steer the giant airship!","That would make a lot more sense.","And how do we do that, Captain Boomerang?","I can't see outside of this floating hunk of metal.","Whoa.","That's ''a lot'' of fire, isn't it.","Sokka, I think we've gotta ... Got it!","You could stand to mention it more.","Aye, aye, Captain.","How did that happen?","Did boomerang come back?","Wow!","Who taught you that?","You have the craziest adventures when you disappear.","Oh, sorry.","Didn't mean to offend you, Phoenix King of Getting His Butt Whooped.","Well I think you all look perfect!","Fine.","Follow me, Twinkle Toes.","'Fraid not.","It's over!","You're under arrest, Yakone!","Take him away.","What were you thinking?","And what were you thinking?","You two have put me in an impossible position.","All right, enough!","Here's what we're going to do.","Su, you need to leave the city as soon as possible.","You'll go stay with your grandparents.","Lin, give me the arrest report.","I'm the Chief of Police!","I can't have a daughter in jail!","This is our only option.","Nice to see you again, Twinkle Toes.","Get over yourself!","The world doesn't need you one bit.","Listen, when I was Chief of Police in Republic City, I worked my ''butt'' off busting criminals.","But did that make crime disappear?","Nope.","If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same.","I'm the original Beifong!","Well, I was planning on soaking my feet in mud for a few weeks.","But I can't stand you being so pathetic and getting your butt kicked all the time.","All right, I guess I can help.","Na-uh-uh-uh.","You want to hug something, go hug a tree.","We're here to work!","Okay, bring it!","Tell me what you did wrong.","Exactly!","You were thinking!","Go again.","Pathetic.","Of ''all'' the Avatar's I've worked with, you're by far the worst.","I know that's only one other Avatar, but still.","Yeah, the swampbenders out here really can't take a punch.","I'm more connected to the world than you've ''ever'' been!","The roots and vines ... they run all over the world.","I can see Su and Lin, Zaofu and Republic City.","I see everything.","You're blind compared to me.","Hah!","Maybe for you.","I had a great time!","I never realized how much I missed tormenting the Avatar I wish you were putting up more of a fight, but it was still fun.","''I know!''","And I'm an old lady!","Imagine me in my prime!","I would have ''destroyed'' you!","Probably carrying around that metal doesn't help.","The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body.","Are you trying to tell me you can't feel metal ''in your own body?''","You really are the worst Avatar ever.","Oh, my girls never really picked up metalbending all that well, if you ask me.","Who do you think you're talking to?","Okay, if you want me to bend out this metal, you need to relax.","''Seriously?''","Your body is like a twisted tree-trunk!","It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax!","Stop fighting me!","All right, that's it.","You're going to have to do this yourself.","Clearly, you want to keep the metal in there.","I don't know!","Maybe so you have an excuse not to go back to being the Avatar.","If you don't get better, you can't do your job, so you don't have to worry about getting hurt again!","Whatever.","When you want it out, you can bend it out.","I can't deal with all your issues for you.","How should I know?","Ask the spirit that brought you here.","The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you, you picked the best swamp in the world!","You're looking at it.","What's there to tell?","I threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got all whiny and Sokka fell in a hole.","Oh yeah.","It was hot.","I was on a blimp.","And I think a giant turtle showed up.","''Wow''.","What a day.","You're terrible at listening to them!","Quit making all that racket!","If you're so anxious to do something, why don't you collect some mushrooms for dinner?","Take the path until you see the boulder with the hole in it.","Then go to your left.","Oh, and make sure you get the big, slimy ones!","They're the tastiest!","There you are.","You got my dinner yet?","Yeah, I figured something like that might happen.","Look, I know you want to get better.","And so does the swamp!","It can sense you're out of balance.","It will teach you what you need to learn, ''if'' you're open to listening.","You said you saw your past enemies.","Now, why do you think that is?","Sounds like you're carrying around your former enemies, the same way you're still carrying around that metal poison.","You maybe consider you could ''learn'' something from them?","My mind is just fine, thank you.","Listen, what did Amon want?","Equality for all.","Unalaq?","He brought back the spirits.","And Zaheer believed in freedom.","The problem was, those guys were ''totally'' out of balance and they took their ideologies too far.","Because you need to face your fears.","You can't expect to deal with future enemies if you're still fighting the ''old'' ones.","Boy, you Avatars sure need a lot of hand-holding.","Get up!","We're going to the banyan-grove tree.","The roots of the banyan-grove tree spread out for miles in every direction, connecting this whole swamp.","Your problem is, you've been disconnected for too long.","Disconnected from the people who love you and disconnected from yourself.","Good.","Hopefully they're here to take you home.","Your grandpa was a real pain in my butt.","Oh, I like this one.","I'm not bending it out of you.","You've got to do this on your own.","Close your eyes.","Clear your mind.","And don't freak out, like last time!","Now, focus your energy.","Find the metal.","Let it move through you body.","That fight is over.","Release the fear.","Well done, Korra.","All right, you earned it.","Finally, some peace and quiet.","Don't bother.","All the prisoners have been moved.","Hey, Chief.","You were only up to my waist the last time we were together.","What?!","Do you have to pee or something?","What's up with him?","I've been living in the swamp and keeping watch on Zaofu through the vines.","By the time I got here, they were gone.","I snooped around town and heard that they were taken away to some nearby prison camp.","How do you know that?","How did you end up dating the kind of dipstick who works for Kuvira?","And I thought Appa was smelly.","Why would you choose this leaky, nasty thing?","Little while now.","Couple of years.","Ah, time flies when you get to be my age.","I'm surprised you came to save Su.","I thought you guys didn't get along.","Good, glad we can put all that behind us.","I think I know where they are.","Feel that cavern a few stories down?","It seems empty, but it's guarded by an awful lot of mech.","She's lying.","I didn't come to fight with Kuvira or destroy a cannon.","I'm here to save my family.","It will take everything we have just to get out alive.","I used to have an academy to train metalbending.","Even blockheads like you can figure it out with the right instruction.","Really?","It's a very rare ability.","Maybe you do have some talent.","Hey!","I'm blind, not deaf.","He was a guy named Kanto.","Nice man, but it didn't really work out between us.","Lin, I can feel your enraged breathing from here.","Just say what you have to say and let's get it over with.","Hey, I forgave you for all your garbage a long time ago and Su and I worked things out.","You're the only one who wants to hold on to this family drama nonsense for the rest of your life.","If that's your decision and it makes you happy, then fine.","The guards are on the other side of that door.","We'll have to be quiet.","For all you know, she could just have been covering her butt because she made a mistake.","If you all want to get yourselves captured again or worse, that's your business.","I'm through.","I told you never to call me that.","You give metalbenders a bad name!","Look, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids.","Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway.","If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me.","Argh, enough!","Enjoy the ride back to the city with the gum flapper here.","No, my fighting days are over.","Don't tell Korra, but my back is killing me now.","This is why you didn't see Katara messing with that civil war nonsense.","At some point, you gotta leave it to the kids."]},"Audience":{"combined_dialog":["Oooh."]},"Lao":{"combined_dialog":["I'm pleased to hear that Toph's private lessons are going well.","But I want to be sure she's not trying anything too

last?","Well, Master Yu is the finest teacher in the land.","He's been teaching Toph since she was little.","Yes, and sadly, because of her blindness, I don't think she will ever become a true master.","Master Yu, I need you to help me get my daughter back.","Toph!","My daughter is blind.","She is blind and tiny and helpless and fragile.","She cannot help you!","Of course it doesn't change

for you, if you want to talk.","I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting, but keep your guard up.","It's not like him to throw a party just for the fun of it.","Meelo!","No, that's not a toilet!","Oh dear.","Korra, this is madness.","This is all your doing!","Korra!","Korra, are you all right?","What happened?","Was Amon here?","Did he ... did he take your bending away?","Ah, thank goodness.","It's all right, the nightmare is over.","Admitting your fears is the first and most difficult step in overcoming them.","I know winning the championship means a lot to you.","But as far as I'm concerned, we need to shut the arena down.","The council is unanimous.","We're closing the arena.","We must prevent the conflict between benders and nonbenders from escalating into all-out war!","The council is not changing its position, Lin.","A word please, Lin.","Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want to see you get hurt.","In that case, I'm going to be by your side during the match.","It's for Korra.","I want to make sure she's safe.","I've known Lin since we were children, she's always been ... challenging.","My father and Lin got along famously.","I'm afraid her issues ... are with me.","What!","How-?","Where'd you get that idea?","Criminy!","I'll have to have a word with her.","Oh, she tried.","Anyway, Pema didn't ''steal'' me, Lin and I had been growing apart for some time.","We both had different goals in li- Why am I even telling you this?","It all happened a long time ago and we've moved passed it.","What do you ... Of course she has!","Anyway, this is none of your business!","How is the security sweep going?","They've checked underneath the stands?","And you have enough officers to cover all points of entry?","Lin, with so much on the line it would be nice if we could help each other out, at least for one night.","Like old times.","I would appreciate that.","Oh come on, refs!","There was some funny business in that last play!","I've been brushing up.","That Wolfbat blatantly bent a disk outside of his zone.","Reminds me of someone else I knew at that age.","You two might get along if you would only give her a chance.","Oh, come on!","Those were illegal head shots!","Open your eyes, ref!","Look out!","He played us all.","Republic City is at war.","We're ready for you now.","So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists then framed Cabbage Corp?","That's right.","Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion.","A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break in.","It was tragic.","It's possible that he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.","In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?","We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.","Raiding the Sato Mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck.","If we're wrong ... Where is your father?","Hiroshi was lying all right, but where is he?","Korra!","No!","You can't give up like this!","Good day, ladies.","Asami, welcome to the island.","Beifong's replacement, Saikhan, is going to be inducted as the new Chief of Police later.","I think we should both be there.","No you're not.","You just need to work through this airbending block.","I wasn't finished yet.","You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers, but also his past lives to call upon for guidance.","Have you ever made contact with your past lives?","You may have made a connection without realizing it.","Perhaps something you mistook as a dream?","And did you see any previous Avatars in these visions?","Hmm, I don't know.","But I urge you to meditate on these visions.","I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.","This is going too far, Tarrlok!","You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few!","I came as fast as I could.","Are your friends all right?","I'll take care of this.","Saikhan, a word please.","No, it cannot.","Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight.","I'd like you to release them immediately.","Those people are entitled to due process under the law.","Oh, I plan to.","At the council meeting, first thing in the morning.","Calm down, Korra.","I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient.","But you really ''are'' the worst!","''Ever!''","Councilman Tenzin here.","What?!","What happened?","What was Korra doing at City Hall?","I urge you to meditate on these visions.","I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something.","I've been on the phone all morning, but nothing yet.","I'm afraid her polar bear dog is missing as well.","Let's bring them all home, Lin.","That's where they must be keeping Korra.","Because ''he'' has Korra.","He fooled us all!","Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice.","But there were no chi blockers here last night.","You planted the evidence, didn't you?","Don't make this worse for yourself.","Tell us where you have Korra.","It could lead us to Korra!","Let's go.","Korra!","Oh, thank goodness.","Yes, she's fine, sweetie.","I'm sorry you were scared, but everything is going to be fine now.","I promise.","Korra, I realize you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened.","But how did you escape?","And where's Tarrlok?","What?","This is very disturbing news.","Amon is becoming emboldened.","Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar ...","I fear Amon is entering his endgame.","Will you stay here and watch over Pema and the children while I meet with the council?","With everything that has happened lately, I want to be sure my family is in safe hands.","Pema!","Ye- yes- yes, Lin has agreed to help out around here and keep an eye on things while I'm away.","Thank you, Lin!","Oogi, yip yip.","The other council members.","Are they all right?","This can't be happening.","Chief Saikhan.","I'm the only Council member left.","What's the status?","The general of the United Forces.","Saikhan, the vents.","We need to evacuate immediately.","Everyone stay close to me.","Not these mecha tanks again!","Saikhan, no!","Thank you.","I'm fine.","Thank you, kids.","Another moment later and I would have been on my way to Amon.","Oh no.","Oh, thank goodness you're all right!","You let them fight?","Do you realize what could have happened?","Pema!","I'm here, Pema.","Hello.","Come, meet your new brother.","Rohan.","I need to protect my family, and get them as far away from this conflict as possible.","If Amon got his hands on my children ...","I hate to even think of it.","But- Thank you, Lin.","Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being.","I'm not asking you to.","I sent word to the United Forces.","They will be here soon.","And once my family is safe, I will return.","With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war.","You're learning well.","Stay safe, Korra.","Oogi, yip yip!","Faster, Oogi!","Lin, what are you doing?!","Yes, she is.","In prison.","I don't know.","Let's go get your mother and the baby.","You saved Republic City.","Great, now I have to entertain my brother.","It's going to be all right Korra.","We need to be patient with her.","It will take time for her to accept what has happened.","I am so proud of you, ''Avatar'' Korra.","You did what!?","The Avatar State is not to be used as a booster rocket!","You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate!","Clearly you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections, not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending.","Is it too late for you to unretire from the United Forces?","You've mastered Korra style airbending, now you need to master real airbending.","Hopefully our visit to all the air temples will give you the inspiration you need to look more deeply into your studies.","No one's fighting!","We're going to have a wonderful time!","Now that the president is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs.","You're not invited.","I'm not sensitive!","Spirit, why are you angry with us?","What have we done to offend you?","Are you all right?","Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable, but Korra still has much to learn about airbending.","And I hope that going to the air temples will help her connect with the past Avatars.","Korra, please listen.","Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together.","It has been a pleasure serving you, Avatar Korra.","Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now.","All right, hop on!","I love you, Mom.","We'll see you soon!","There it is, the Southern Air Temple.","Isn't it magnificent?","Good to see you again, Abbot Shung.","No thank you, I'm fine.","Oh.","Okay?","That's right, Jinora, the most sacred place in the entire Southern Air Temple.","Here, you will find statues of ''every'' Avatar who ever lived.","Where are your brother and sister?","Meelo!","Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since- Aaand, it's over.","Yes, he has.","It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family.","Isn't that right, my little Rohan?","And I've really enjoyed having you two around.","Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad.","No, that can't be right.","What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant koi?","Hmm.","Oh, remember Ember Island?","Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach.","I could've sworn.","It's all right, dear, Ikki couldn't have gone far., I'll find her.","Sure, I could use the help.","Ikki!","Ikki!","Ikki?","Ikki, where are you?","Why would Ikki run off like this?","Ah, it's probably my fault.","Excuse me?","Kya, you're right.","I haven't been spending enough time with them.","I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.","Dad was under a lot of pressure.","Dad loved us all ''equally''.","Besides, it all happened a long time ago.","Why are we even talking about this?","We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark.","Uch.","Here we go.","And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki?","I'm sick of your far-fetched tales.","''Three'' typhoons?","Come on!","At least fifty times faster, by my calculations.","If you need an airlift down, just say the word.","Bumi!","Kya's right.","You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest.","''I'' had to become the responsible one.","Sure, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself.","It was time for you to settle down somewhere.","You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire ''culture'' on your shoulders.","Oh, so ''that's'' what this is all about.","Who else is going to do it?","Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place.","I can't be around you two right now.","Go back to the temple and see if Ikki returned.","I'll keep looking out here.","Fine.","Ikki!","Ikki, where are you?","Shoo!","Go bother someone else.","You two are worse than Kya and Bumi.","Ikki!","Oh, thank goodness.","Actually, is there room for one more?","Nice to meet you, Blueberry Spicehead.","New ones, huh?","Can they be ''my'' new brothers and sisters too?","You like that, don't you, Blueberry Spicehead?","Yes, you do.","You know, I could get used to it here.","No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional.","Let's not.","They'll only spoil our good mood.","But what about Meelo?","He's hilarious too, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth.","And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle.","I couldn't agree with you more.","That's very wise of you, Ikki.","I suppose.","We can't hide in this cave forever.","Yes, I'd like that.","I wanted to apologize for how I acted yesterday.","I've worked so hard to celebrate Dad's legacy that I may have overlooked the parts of him that were less than ideal.","That's one happy family.","No, no, you can't just demonstrate it.","That never works.","Ugh, classic over-rewarding.","Command respect.","Having some trouble, son?","Believe me, I know the feeling.","Maybe I can help.","How would you like your old dad to teach you how to be a master trainer?","All right, Meelo, the first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish ''dominance''.","You are in charge.","Never forget that.","Now call Poki.","Meelo ... you're rewarding him for bad behavior.","You can't let him nap in the bed with you.","You are the alpha lemur.","He has to sleep on the floor.","I know it's hard, but it's for the best.","I know.","Well done, Meelo!","I knew you could learn to train Poki.","I've created a monster.","Uh, maybe we should forget about all this training discipline for now.","Why don't you and Poki just have fun and play?","Jinora, there you are.","Come on, everyone's waiting.","Were you playing with someone?","All right, who's ready for an exciting tour of the Eastern Air Temple?","We've got a lot to see today, including ancient statues, ancient gardens, and the meditation hall used by ancient airbenders.","Korra?","See?","This is why schedules are important.","It's great to see you too, but why aren't you training at the South Pole?","What?","No.","We've been out of touch with the outside world since we started our vacation.","Just tell us everything!","I knew this would happen.","So Avatar Wan imprisoned this dark spirit Vaatu in the Spirit World?","I knew Unalaq was hungry for power, but never realized how far he would go to get it.","No, don't blame yourself.","This is Unalaq's doing.","Now, we must focus on setting things right before he can do any more damage.","So, you need to close the Southern portal, but if Unalaq's army controls the South, how are we going to get to it?","A journey to the Spirit World.","All my years of spiritual training have prepared me for this moment.","I will help you.","Today, we enter the Spirit World.","You're lucky.","This temple is the most spiritual of all the air temples.","Why, this very garden is where my father met Guru Pathik.","I would be if Meelo could ring his bell at the appropriate intervals.","Kya, this is too much smoke.","You set it up wrong.","This isn't going to work.","Well, the moment's ruined.","Focus, Korra.","Focus.","No talking.","Feel the energy of the universe.","Korra, really!","I'm trying to concentrate here!","I don't think this location is going to work either.","Well, nothing is feeling right to me.","Well ... actually, I've never been into the Spirit World.","''Trying'' to get in.","It never happened.","It's my greatest shortcoming as an airbender, spiritual leader, and son of Aang.","I've spent years studying the techniques and theories of ancient spiritual leaders.","Now that the Avatar needs me, it must be my time.","You have to trust me.","I can help you.","Jinora?","She's too young and untrained to have any knowledge about spiritual matters.","And how would you know that?","How did you do that?","How long have you been able to do this?","I don't know.","The spiritual energy is historically strongest ''near'' the temple.","The resemblance is uncanny.","Are you sure these spirits are leading us into the right place?","This is an ancient airbender meditation circle.","We'll have to perform a spiritual cleansing ceremony.","Dad taught it to me.","This site has been neglected for many years.","A cleansing ceremony will help strengthen its connections to the Spirit World.","It's working.","What are we supposed to do?","Your spiritual training has come a long way.","He taught you how to transform dark spirits.","I can't even get you into the Spirit World.","I won't let you down.","The ancient airbenders must have built this site.","If we meditate here, we'll be able to enter the Spirit World.","After all these years, my father's dreams for me will finally come true.","No!","Just give me some time.","Jinora will ''not'' enter the Spirit World!","She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but ''I am''.","I've spent ''years'' training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the Spirit World.","If everyone could just be quiet and let me ''focus''.","Perhaps I will never have the connections with spirits like I always wanted ... like my father wanted me to have.","I'm proud of you.","Go.","Close the portal.","We'll wait here and keep your bodies safe till you return.","I can't believe my little girl had to guide Korra into the Spirit World instead of me.","If anything happens to her I won't be able to forgive myself.","They won't have their bending in there.","They'll be defenseless!","Of course you aren't, because ''you'' have your ... um ... Why don't you two get some sleep.","I'll take the first watch.","I know you are.","Thank you.","Please come back soon.","Korra!","What was it like?","Did you manage to close the portal?","Was Jinora able to help you?","Where's Jinora?","W-Why isn't she waking up?","Korra!","What happened to my little girl?","Her spirit is trapped in the Spirit World, but she's going to be all right.","Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us.","There are lives on the line!","And my daughter is one of them!","Raiko, you must reconsider!","Korra, we don't have much time.","We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.","Unalaq will be waiting for you.","You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him.","As soon as we reach the Southern Water Tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main portal.","Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the Spirit World.","I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter.","Really?","And what do you suggest?","I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now!","This is serious!","Where is my mother?","Her soul is trapped in the Spirit World.","How much longer can she survive like this?","Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.","Enough of your ridiculous lies!","Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?!","Let's circle around and see if we can find a way in from the other side.","Hold on!","The spirits are weighting Oogi down!","We're losing altitude!","I failed in every way.","We've lost Jinora forever.","Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?","C'mon!","Ah, this isn't working.","We can't just randomly wander the Spirit World, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her.","Enough!","We can't do this by ourselves.","We need a spirit guide.","There.","Spirit, hello.","I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance.","We're completely lost.","We're walking in circles, I've seen that same spirit mushroom five times.","See?","Even it knows we're lost.","How ...?","Where ...?","It's been so long.","How did you know we were here?","Iroh, we are grateful, but we're not looking for the way out.","We're looking for my daughter.","I'm not leaving until I find Jinora.","A place where only the lost can find you ...?","That's it!","I know where to find Jinora!","Trust me.","Hey you!","Spirit!","Wake up!","This is a prison.","The Fog of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans.","I read about that in ancient text.","The fog is actually a spirit that infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories.","Ah, no!","Get off me!","If we stay together, we'll find Jinora and make it out of this fog.","Jinora!","Jinora!","What, do you hear something?","Bumi, you must focus your mind.","Right now!","There are no cannibals.","Kya, we're your brothers.","You must remember, before the fog infects you.","No!","Bumi!","Kya!","Come back!","You must stay focused.","Remember who you are Tenzin.","You are the son of Avatar Aang.","You are the hope for future generations of airbenders.","The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.","But what if I fail?","Then your father's hopes of the future dies with you.","I can't fail.","You will.","Ah, stop it!","I am the son of Avatar Aang.","I am the hope for future generations of airbenders.","I am the son of Avatar Aang.","Dad, I've failed you.","I am no spiritual leader, and I've let the world down.","I'll never be the man you were.","I am not a reflection of my father.","I am Tenzin.","I am Tenzin!","Jinora!","You'll be okay sweetie.","I'm here.","You were trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls.","And I wasn't going to let you stay there.","What are you talking about?","How do you know?","Jinora, wait!","Thank goodness you're all okay.","Were you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?","If that's true, then- The other Avatars may not be able to help you anymore, but, perhaps I can.","I know I haven't been the best mentor to you.","But I realized it was because I had a lot of spiritual growth to do myself.","There may still be a way for you to stop Vaatu.","Let go of your attachment to who you think you are, and connect with your inner spirit.","I'm not talking about Raava.","Raava is not who you are.","Come with me, I need to show you something.","Because this tree had a history long before it held Vaatu.","This is the Tree of Time.","And the legends say its roots bind the spirit and physical worlds together.","Yes.","I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe.","The Tree of Time remembers all.","Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit.","You have always been strong, unyielding, fearless.","Before he fused with Raava, Wan was just a regular person.","That's right.","He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was.","He wasn't defined by Raava anymore than you are.","You have to help them, Korra.","Do as the ancients once did.","Connect to the cosmic energy of the universe.","Don't bend the elements, but the energy within yourself.","I have no doubt.","I'm proud of you.","The Avatar Spirit has returned.","You were amazing.","Now that you're bonded with Raava once again, are you also reconnected with your past lives?","I see.","Why don't you close the portals, and we'll go home.","What do you mean?","I think you should trust your instincts.","There is nothing else I can teach you.","You are the Avatar.","Whatever your decision, I support you.","I'm sure you'll find a way.","What is it?","What's wrong?","Hilarious.","Time for dinner, everyone.","Stop waving your arms around at the table.","It's not funny anymore.","No one is bending giant boulders!","''Unbelievable''.","You're actually an airbender.","I suppose it's ''possible''.","Lin, you won't believe this.","Bumi just started airbending.","You mean there's another one?","Where is he now?","It's like a dream, Dad.","After a hundred and seventy years, new airbenders.","Well, in a way, all airbenders are our family.","Of course not.","But we might have to get used to not being the ''only'' airbenders around anymore.","But maybe, there will be enough to fill the temples again.","I just wish your grandfather was here to see this.","No, but I think the new airbenders will need lots of help and guidance to understand what it means to be part of our nation.","That's a big responsibility.","I know you will.","You must be at the end of your rope.","You hate meditating.","You didn't ''ruin'' anything.","You did what you thought was best for the world, and now things have changed.","Change can be good or bad, depending on your point of view.","You're not the President, Korra.","Your job isn't to fix the daily problems of every person in Republic City.","Your responsibility is to bring balance to the entire world, and that means no matter what you do, some people are not going to be happy about it.","On the other hand, some people will be very happy.","Like me.","What you did during Harmonic Convergence may have brought back the Air Nation, and that can only be good for restoring balance.","That is the act of a great Avatar.","True wisdom begins when we accept things as they are.","You've started a new age, Korra.","There's no going back to the past.","It is absolutely my pleasure to meet you, Daw.","I have never met a new airbender before.","Well, at least not one whose diaper I didn't have to change.","Don't think I'm not going with you.","It's so exciting.","Who knows who's out there now, discovering the gift of airbending for the first time?","I'll miss you too.","Once we find the airbenders, I'll send word.","You can join us at the Northern Air Temple then.","Go easy on them, son.","And it's all because of you, Korra.","I hate to get down to business, but is the airbender here now?","I just want to say it's an honor to meet a fellow airbender.","Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now.","Harmonic Convergence changed everything.","You represent the future of a culture that is being reborn.","You're going to help us rebuild the Air Nation.","But you must come with us to the Northern Air Temple.","Of course you can come.","This is of the utmost importance.","Your wife will understand.","Sir, you must understand, you're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about, skills you must master.","No, we can't coerce people, or throw them in potato sacks.","They must come freely.","But not to worry, there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation is all about.","When your son becomes a master, he'll have tattoos all over his body, just like me.","There's nothing more nutritious than our vegetarian diet.","I can tell that you're going to love wearing our ancient airbender robes.","They're very breathable.","You'll never have to worry about your worldly possessions again, because you won't have any.","You'll get to shave your head.","Your best friend will be a giant bison!","Ugh, I really thought I had that last guy.","Who doesn't want a bison as their best friend?","Well, I guess we should just go to Ba Sing Se and try our luck there.","I'm willing to try anything at this point.","Hang on a second Kai, where are your parents?","We can't have you come with us without their permission.","I'm so sorry about your parents.","I know we could never replace them ... but we are here for you.","Do you really want our first member of the Air Nation to be a liar and a thief?","Yes, you can release the boy into our custody.","Jinora, we're leaving now.","I've never met her, but I've heard she can be quite ... demanding.","Kai?","He is just a little boy, and he's our responsibility.","Besides, he's the only airbender we've recruited so far, we can't lose him.","I can't believe the Earth Queen is conscripting airbenders.","You can still do that?!","If anything goes wrong, come back immediately.","They're not down there?!","There are just too many places.","There has to be another way to locate them.","What do you mean \"a connection\"?","We have to get into that compound tonight and get those airbenders out.","nan Lin?","What are you doing here?","How is that possible?","No ...","Shortly after we found out you were the Avatar, Zaheer and three others attempted to kidnap you.","Luckily, your father, Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka and I were there to stop them.","We apprehended the criminals and locked them away in prisons designed to impair their abilities.","It was for your own safety.","Bumi and Korra, come with me to find the airbenders.","You three, find Kai.","We'll meet on the surface shortly.","Radio us if anything goes wrong.","Everyone, please!","You must stay calm and quiet if we want this to work.","We're going to get you away from the Earth Queen and out of the city.","We're already taking care of it.","Oogi!","I know that none of you chose to become airbenders.","But now you do have a choice.","We can relocate you somewhere safe, or you can come with me to the Northern Air Temple, to live in peace and train as Air Nomads.","You are no longer anyone's property.","What path you decide is up to you.","Be careful out there.","Stay safe.","But you made some new friends too.","You did well, Korra.","His pupils pleaded with their master to eat something, but he refused, just like he had each day during summer.","Instead he meditated and got his nourishment from the universe.","So when Tang Xu completed the ninety-seventh day of his historic fast on which island?","Anyone besides Otaku, who already studied this in his acolyte training?","And is answering every question.","That is correct.","Again.","Now, on day ninety-eight ... Only after many years of practice and intense training.","Besides, we don't have enough bison here for all of you.","Actually, the plural of bison is bison.","No, that's a wild herd.","It would take many years to tame them.","Now, let's get back to our lessons.","Okay, everyone is dismissed.","We'll pick this up ... tomorrow.","How is everything in the city?","What!","Is everyone all

be interested in the hard work of becoming part of the Air Nation.","Bumi?!","He's my worst student.","That actually sounds like a good plan.","You're turning into a pretty wise Avatar after all.","Bumi, can I talk to you?","Actually, I need your help.","I don't think I'm doing well with the new airbenders, and everyone knows you're a natural leader.","What would you do if you were in

recruit!","Nothing like a ten-mile hike first thing in the morning.","No!","Of course not.","Then, this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique.","Airbenders are able to warm themselves only with their breathing.","Everyone get into the lotus position.","Ah, this is so much more refreshing than sleeping.","Hush!","Meditation time.","Focus.","Now that we're refreshed

and, you won't even know they're there!","When the head is shaved, an airbender is able to feel the wind around him.","It is both humbling and freeing.","All right, who's next?","That's fine, shaving your head is a personal choice.","Anyone else?","Fine!","Then we can get to our next training exercise: obstacle course.","Jinora, I have this under control Concentrate!","Remember, airbenders move like the wind.","Stay light on your feet, and you'll never feel the stinging rash cactus.","Everyone is waiting for you, Bumi.","If you don't make it over the next thirty seconds, they'll ''all'' have to run through the course again!","Get back up the wall, recruit!","You're letting your fellow airbenders down.","Fine, quit!","We don't need your attitude in the new Air Nation.","Go home?","You just got here.","I'm tired of all this complaining!","Jinora, take over!","Yes, just lead them through some basic exercises.","What brought this on?","Kai!","What does he know about when you should get tattoos?","The answer is \"no\"!","You're just a little girl.","Ikki, Meelo, you're up.","Just lead them through the Bagua circle.","Tattoos.","How could she think?","Focus.","Breathe.","Bumi ruins everything.","Inhale.","Focus.","I've failed.","Bumi quit, the rest of the airbenders want to go home.","Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?","Tell me about it.","It's actually better for your back.","Sorry.","Now I know how Korra feels when I'm talking to her.","Thank you, Pema.","Bumi, I want to apologize for losing my patience.","What?","Her boyfriend?","Kai!","What's going on down there?","I'm coming Jinora.","Kai, that's enough!","An airbender never attacks a defenseless opponent.","But that was very good technique.","I'm proud of you.","Your connection with the spirits, natural leadership, you remind me of Dad.","You are now.","The bison are the original airbenders.","They recognize their own kind.","I'm just lucky no one's hurt.","But I also realized that perhaps I was too harsh on you.","It's hard for me to believe that my little girl is grown up enough to have her tattoos.","I'll promise I'll think about it.","Fair enough?","I guess everyone is growing up.","Hello?","This is Tenzin.","Oh no.","It's too late.","He's here.","We need to get everyone out of here.","Stay close to me.","It's Zaheer.","Round everyone up!","We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately!","What is it you want from us?","Then what are you doing here?","You're using us as leverage.","I will never let you get to Korra.","Yes, I do.","Jinora!","Get everyone out of here.","Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off!","And stay out of her line of sight!","Go, ''go''!","As long as I'm breathing, it's not over.","I don't know.","Zaheer moved them out of the temple.","Gone.","All the bison got scared off during the attack.","But, I think I know another way out.","Bolin, can you get us to that wall?","Through there.","Incredible.","Kai.","You're all right.","Did Zaheer get away with Korra?","What?","I've heard the legends about Guru Laghima's ability to fly.","I'd never imagine they were true.","And find the airbenders.","Where are they?","How did you find them?","Oogi!","I'm glad to see you too, old friend.","Find the airbenders, and my family.","Oh, thank goodness you're all right.","I'll be fine.","He's unlocked powers of airbending that haven't existed for thousands of years.","You're looking stronger everyday, Korra.","She'll be fine.","She just needs time to heal.","The poison took a great toll.","Jinora, come forward.","Today, we welcome the first airbending master in a generation.","And I couldn't be more proud of my daughter.","When the existence of our people was threatened, when the Avatar's life hung in the balance, Jinora never gave up hope.","Thanks to her leadership, I see a very bright future for the Air Nation.","Of course, there would be no Air Nation without Avatar Korra: she opened the portals and somehow the world began anew for us.","And she was even willing to lay down her own life in order to protect ours.","There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done.","But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice.","So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the earth.","But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord to restore balance and peace.","Avatar Korra, I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the world.","Now, let us anoint the master who will help lead us in our new path.","After your coronation, the United Forces will escort you to Ba Sing Se.","Well, the roving bandits have ''mostly'' been dispersed.","No, we thought she was coming with you.","I assure you, your daughter is not here.","Now, I don't want you to worry about a thing while you're gone.","Your recovery should be your number one concern.","Jinora, the airbenders, and I have everything under control.","How have you been, Korra?","You look great!","All right!","The sparring match is over!","There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery.","Being the Avatar can wait.","The situation has been stabilizing since Kuvira took charge.","I know you want to help.","But trust me, everyone has this under control.","I just think you need to ... Nooo ...","I was going to say, you need to ... not worry about the future.","Be grateful for where you are now and the progress you've made.","I see the prince is becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership.","Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the world on the lookout for her.","I hope they find her soon.","I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military.","They say she's throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps.","Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here.","This ... is a mission of the utmost importance.","Conflict is coming to the Earth Kingdom and we ''need'' to find the Avatar.","Can I count on you three to bring Korra home?","Raiko asked me to stay here and help figure out a diplomatic solution to this Kuvira problem.","We're you able to get a read on Korra yet?","Good luck!","And be careful!","Remember, Jinora's in charge!","Meelo ...

Pro-bending?","We've got the quarterfinal match.","I am not, we're just having fun together.","What do you care, anyway?","Wait a second ... you're not worried about him, you're jealous!","You ''do'' have feelings for me!","Admit it!","You like me.","Yeah, but when you're with her you're thinking about me, aren't you?","I'm just being honest.","You're a liar!","I had an opening so I took it!","Save your breath.","You've already made it clear how you feel about me.","So you ''do'' like me?","You're blaming me?","''You'' kissed me back!","Well played, Korra.","I'll unnecessarily rough you up!","Come on!","We still have a chance, even if it is a slim one!","Look, if we don't pull together and work as a team, we'll never forgive ourselves.","You're welcome.","So ...","I know things are confusing right now, but I hope we can still be friends.","I hope we see you in the finals.","Then we'll know who the losers ''really'' are.","Thanks!","But, if it hadn't been for you and your father, we wouldn't have had the chance to play.","So thank you.","Ooh, let me help!","Relax, I'm a healer!","I learned from Katara, the best there is.","Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.","I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand.","I had a great time, honestly!","You are one of a kind, Bolin.","What?","How is it over already?","Man, I got a good feeling about tonight.","I don't care if we are the underdogs.","We can take those pompous Wolfbats.","I'm not waiting to find out.","We need to get to City Hall.","As the Avatar and a pro-bending player, I have a right to be heard.","You can't cancel the finals.","What about the rest of you?","Tarrlok, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right?","I-I don't understand.","I thought you, of all people, would take a stand against Amon.","The reality is if you close the arena, you let Amon win!","Yeah, you do?","Thank you!","Excuse me, Chief Beifong.","I wanted to thank you for your help, it ... really ... means a lot ... What is her deal?","Even when she's on my side, she's against me!","What did your father do to make her hate the Avatar so much?","Wait a second ... it all makes sense now!","You and Beifong, Beifong and you.","You two were a couple!","Ha!","Your wife.","So ... Pema stole you from Beifong.","I'm surprised our \"esteemed Chief of Police\" didn't throw her in jail.","Hm, apparently Beifong hasn't.","See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker!","I'm gonna knock Tahno's ''stupid'' hair off his ''stupid'' head!","What's wrong with these refs?","If the Wolfbats are gonna fight dirty, then so should we.","Argh, that's no fun but ... all right.","Hmph, chump.","What?","I'm going after Amon!","I'm fine, thanks to you.","Guys!","Great news.","You don't have to go back on the streets.","I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements.","You can come live on Air Temple Island with me!","I was just leaving.","So, I guess I'll see you guys around, some time.","I don't know.","I have some ... Avatar stuff to do.","All right, Pabu.","Tahno?","Listen, I know we're not exactly best friends, but I'm sorry Amon took your bending.","Looks like you guys settled right in.","Way cooler than a makeover.","The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog.","Let's do it!","That was amazing!","I didn't think we'd make it.","Smart guy.","Uh, is there another bathroom I can use?","Thanks.","Uh, sorry!","I forgot, I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids.","See you later!","Well, I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard.","Sato's up to something.","A motive?","What is it?","That's terrible.","I overheard him on the phone yesterday.","Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists.","I overheard you on the phone.","You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time, and you're getting ready to strike.","Explain that!","I can't believe we didn't find anything.","No, I'm not!","I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying.","What?","Don't be ridiculous!","That has nothing to do with it!","I'm sorry.","Hiroshi is ''not'' the man you think he is.","I think you guys should hear this.","\"If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight.\"","I knew it!","Where?","Maybe you don't know everything about your father.","I'm sorry.","And I'm guessing ''those'' are the new weapons.","Hiroshi, I ''knew'' you were a lying, no good Equalist!","Come out here and- I know.","I'm sorry this whole thing happened.","Of course it does.","And Asami's welcome, too.","After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako.","Oh, I thought you were only bringing a ''few'' things.","No problem, everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome.","Meelo, why don't you go with the boys too?","Ikki and I will take you to your room this way.","So, here's your room.","I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to.","What is that weasel snake Tarrlok up to now?","Ha!","Forget it!","There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.","Don't hold your breath, bub.","You know, Tenzin's been right about you all along.","You played me, you played Beifong, and now you're playing the new Chief too.","Well, I got news for you.","You need me, but I don't need you.","I'm the Avatar.","I don't understand what's wrong with me.","I've memorized nearly all of the practice forms, but I still can't produce a single measly puff of air!","I'm a failure.","Amazing advice.","I'll get right on that.","No, of course I haven't.","Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus?","I'm a spiritual failure, too.","Maybe.","I had a few weird hallucinations, but I hardly even remember them.","I saw Aang.","It seemed like he was in trouble.","What do you think it means?","I'm fine.","How am I suppose to save this city when I can't even learn airbending?","I'm the worst Avatar ever!","I just feel ... alone.","Yeah, let's do it!","All right, Let's ride.","All right, scratch that.","Any other ideas?","Let's get 'em!","Oh, hey Tarrlok.","Nice of you to show up finally.","Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you.","Hmm, that's funny.","I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time.","If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would've gotten away.","What a gentleman, thanks!","Why is the power out?","Sure doesn't look that way.","Everyone, please stay calm.","I'm gonna put a stop to this.","Tarrlok, you need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone.","We're not going anywhere.","You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals.","Stop!","Tarrlok!","Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin.","He can get you out.","This isn't over, Tarrlok.","Hey!","I don't know!","These knuckleheads won't tell me anything.","Your so called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists.","They should be released, too.","You're officially the worst Chief of Police ever!","Wake up, Naga.","Let's go.","Wait for me here, girl.","Don't worry, I'll be all right.","You and I need to talk.","Don't you see?","You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders.","You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people!","Of- Of course not!","You and I are ''nothing'' alike!","That's why you arrested them?","To get to me?","You need to be stopped!","You're just as bad as Amon!","Still think that I'm a half-baked Avatar?","What are you gonna do now?","You're all out of water, pal.","You're, you're a bloodbender?","It's not a full moon!","How- how are you doing this?!","Where are you taking me?","You can't do this!","Let me out!","Garh!","Somebody!","Help!","Please!","Please.","Whoa.","I finally connected with you, Aang.","But, what are you trying to tell me?","A way out of this box would be nice.","Aang ... this whole time ... you were trying to warn me about Tarrlok.","So your little bloodbending secret's out?","And I know how you bloodbent me without a full moon.","You're Yakone's son.","Tarrlok, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go.","You'll never get away with this!","Naga.","You came looking for me.","Good girl.","I'm fine.","I'm glad you're here.","Mmm.","Mmm.","The food tastes amazing, Pema.","I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.","Well, first off, Tarrlok isn't who he says he is.","He's Yakone's son.","Amon captured him, and took his bending.","Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere.","He almost got me, too.","We heard explosions, what's going on?","It's right around here somewhere.","There it is.","Hey, you guys got arrested and left me alone with the car!","I made it very clear I don't know how to drive.","Everything all right?","Are you all right?","What do you want to do, Tenzin?","I'm not giving up.","What you're saying is, we need to be patient.","You too.","Everyone, climb on!","Let's go, girl!","Nice one, Naga!","I hate this \"being patient\" stuff.","Thanks so much for letting us hide out with you the past few days.","No, I have this awful pit in my stomach.","I think you're pretty incredible too, but ... you already knew that.","I should probably try to get some sleep.","Good night.","Once the United Forces arrive, we need to be ready to help in any way we can.","Wait a second ... where are the Equalist airships?","It's all right, I've got you.","I know.","Every time we think we have an advantage, Amon outsmarts us.","I know just the man for the job.","Tenzin's brother?","Wait, I'm sorry, but I'm not going with you tomorrow.","I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon.","It's time I face him.","I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down.","My guts tell me it's time to end this, on ''my'' terms.","You don't have to do that.","I will.","Good luck.","If you're going into the mountains, you should bring Naga.","Take good care of Bolin for me.","There's Amon.","We ambush him.","We'll be there, sir.","I know another way in.","Let's hide in the attic.","Tarrlok?","We had no idea you were here.","Are there other prisoners on the island?","And what makes you so special?","What?","How did your brother end up becoming Amon?","That's one of the saddest stories I've ever heard.","So, he somehow uses bloodbending to take people's bending.","How in the world do we beat him?","So much for our ambush.","If we stay here, we're toast.","But there's another way to beat him.","This whole time, Amon has been one step ahead of us.","But finally ''we'' have the advantage.","We know the truth about him.","If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters ... ... We could take away his true power!","Thank you, for your help.","We can't just leave him here.","That's a lie, Amon!","Or should I call you Noatak?","Amon has been lying to you.","The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away.","He uses bloodbending to do it.","Amon is a waterbender!","Your family wasn't killed by a firebender.","His father was Yakone, and his brother ... is Councilman Tarrlok.","What?","No ... they got away.","We saw them get away!","Amon, let them go!","I don't care!","We have to save them!","Where are Pema and the baby?","Beifong?","Follow me, kids.","Get them out of here.","We'll create a diversion.","No!","Mako ... my bending.","No!","I - I can airbend?","I can airbend!","No ... you ... ''don't''!","But Amon got away.","No, it's not.","Go away.","No, I mean, go away, back to Republic City.","Get on with your life.","I'm not the Avatar anymore.","You don't need to do me any favors.","I - I can't.","Not now Tenzin, I just want to be left alone.","Aang.","How?","I love you too.","It's the Avatar State and I'm the Avatar.","Who appreciates it more than me?","Great, ''more'' attention.","Before we go on your dad's study trip, we're gonna have some real fun in my home town at the Glacier Spirits Festival.","They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks.","Ooh, I like that one.","That sounds so fun.","All I do is train all day.","It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.","Of course you'd take his side!","I'm gonna take a walk.","You remember Mako.","Knock it off, Dad.","Uh, no.","They came to greet ''them.''","That's Eska and Desna, the chief's children.","Desna is a guy.","Good to see you too.","I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival.","It's fun.","Wait, spirits are attacking ships?","I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits.","Airbending is getting pretty boring.","This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle.","Wow, I've never seen that.","I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?","Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's.","Those two have always creeped me out.","They smell like a grandma's attic.","Unalaq offered to train me.","He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them.","Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids.","I'll never finish training with him in charge.","I mean, you heard what Unalaq said.","The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it, but my dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me.","Well?","What do you think I should do?","Oh thanks.","That's a big help.","Just forget it.","Uh, Naga what are you doing?","Naga, hush!","Quiet, Naga, you'll wake everyone up!","What, is, that?","How are you able to control that spirit when no one else could?","Ugh Hey!","I'm right here!","Anyone want to ask me what I think?","I'm tired of listening to you.","Both of you.","You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best.","But both of you were powerless against the spirit attack.","I think it's time I had a new teacher.","Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn.","I have to go with him.","I'm sorry, Tenzin.","This is as far as we go.","Do you think I did the right thing?","What can I say?","I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting.","You're going to train me at the South Pole?","A dangerous trip to the South Pole?","Count me in!","I thought you said Bolin was coming?","Thanks, Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine.","Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?","What happened in the past?","No, the conversation is over.","Dad, come if you want, just don't interfere with my training.",".","So once we get to the South Pole, then what happens?","I'm sorry, what now?","And that's why the evil spirits are attacking?","What do you mean ... in time?","The winter solstice is tomorrow.","Easy, Naga.","Dark spirits.","Uncle, why do you think the dark spirits are following us?","Told me what!?","You were banished from the North?","Why?","I can't believe you kept this from me.","Why did you keep hiding things from me and then telling me it's for my own protection?","I'm tired of you ''protecting'' me!","Dad, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits and the physical world, and I finally have a chance to live up to my potential.","The Northern Lights.","No, Dad, ''you're'' leaving.","Then what are we waiting for?","So, what exactly were you and my dad talking about?","Y'know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.","Trees frozen in the ice.","So, what do I do?","But I don't have any connection with the spirits.","In fact, it seems like they hate me.","I guess I'm just so used to people telling me how to do things that I forgot what it was like to have someone trust in me.","Wait here, I'll be okay.","The spirit portal.","Amazing.","The light in the dark.","Why isn't it opening?","Come on portal, open!","The spirits, dancing in the sky.","Everything you said was true.","Thanks.","By the way, I'm really sorry for being a total pain.","Things were really stressful and pretty confusing.","It's hard being the Avatar.","What are all your Northern troops doing here?","Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?","''I'' can protect it.","But, the solstice is over.","How am I going to open it?","With both portals open, our tribes will be united again.","Chief Unalaq is here to help the South.","He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.","All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.","You want to start a war?","Are you crazy?","I'll do it for the tribe.","I'm sorry to interrupt.","It's about our conversation this morning.","I understand why you brought your troops here, but I'm afraid it's sending the wrong message.","Not just him.","Varrick too.","There was a meeting at my parents' house.","A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.","I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war.","How do we stop it?","I'm usually the one starting fights.","I don't know how to stop them from happening.","Maybe Tenzin was right.","Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.","Thank you, Uncle.","Stop!","Everyone, calm down.","You're all part of the same tribe, start acting like it.","I'm not taking anyone's side.","Hey!","Oh, fabulous.","My tribe's about to go to war, and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me?","No!","And I didn't ask for my father's help.","Can't he just let me be the Avatar?","Ugh.","I'm sorry.","My dad just gets me all worked up.","Uh, 'cause I thought it was pretty obvious?","Did Dad send you to talk to me?","Ask Dad.","You knew?","And you never said anything.","I never wanted a normal childhood.","All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar.","But everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents!","Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.","No?","Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?","So I should just sit back and let the Water Tribes go to war?","Dad is part of a rebellion?","It's too late, Mom.","I'm already in the middle of it.","Uncle!","Oh, no.","Uncle?","Dad?","Dad, don't do this.","No.","Leave Unalaq and go.","I'll tell him I tried to stop you, but you escaped.","We can still avoid a war.","We're all part of the same tribe.","I don't wanna hurt you.","Dad, stop!","Why did you do this, Dad?","What?","Who are you?","Where's my father?","I'm just glad I got here in time.","Wait, you can't just lock them away.","That will only make the South angrier.","No.","But let them stand trial for what they did.","Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.","Thank you, Uncle.","Is it okay if I come in?","I'm so glad you weren't there.","I don't know what I would've done.","I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels.","And for all the pain I've caused you and Mom.","Mom, Dad, of course I still need you.","You're making a mistake.","I can't believe you're doing this to your own family.","Uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you.","I hope so.","Yes.","Well, yes, but - My parents' house.","My parents are innocent!","You can't do this!","You take their lives, and I'll take yours!","Thank you, Uncle.","Good, let's bust you out of here right now.","Fine.","I promise.","It's okay, Mom.","I know.","It's not about what ''I'' want.","It's about what Naga wants.","And she'd like you to let my father out of prison.","What are you talking about?","Unless you wanna be Naga's afternoon snack, you'd better keep talking.","So Unalaq told you what to say?","Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?","What do you mean, \"he got my father banished\"?","Keep talking.","Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!","I found out the truth about my dad's banishment.","Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe.","Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them.","Just like the whole trial.","I can't believe I trusted him.","I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail.","I need your help.","I know.","Will you help me or not?","I'm pretty sure the ''guy'' is supposed to give the ''girl'' the betrothal necklace.","My dad's in there.","Where is he?","Where's my father?","Bring him back.","Or I'm taking you out and the rest of your army.","You don't want unity.","You want power.","You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you?","You got him banished so you could become chief, and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father.","No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him.","Well, I don't want your help anymore.","I'm done being manipulated by you.","You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North.","Because you still need ''me'' to open the Northern portal.","Let's go.","On a ship headed north.","Think we can catch up to it?","If only we had a plane to get me close to those ships.","I could waterbend them out of the way.","I have an idea.","Now!","There!","My dad's on ''that'' ship!","Jump!","Where are the prisoners?","So once I knew the truth, I couldn't sit by and do nothing.","Mine too.","I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad.","But you said the South doesn't stand a change against Unalaq's forces.","I can help.","For what?","I started a civil war.","I ''didn't'' start a war.","Well, I did, but it's more complicated than you're making it seem.","I'll go too.","The people of the South need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders.","What?","I'm not neutral!","The North invaded my home.","The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South.","I'm going to find out about this peace march.","The Northern Water Tribe is out of control!","Of course, they're responsible.","Who else would it be?","I hope President Raiko listens to us.","Hello, Mr. President.","Sir, the Southern Water Tribe- Unalaq's troops have invaded the South.","We need you to send the United Forces to help.","Unalaq isn't even the rightful ruler of the Water Tribe.","He lied his way onto the Northern throne.","\"The people responsible\"?","Who else would it be but the Northerners?","You're the one who's lost perspective.","I'm trying to save my tribe, and you're taking pictures.","My family is going to be wiped out, and it'll be on ''your'' head for doing ''nothing'' about it.","I can't believe the President is doing nothing!","H-He doesn't even care!","How could you take ''his'' side?","Well, you're not ''helping'' me!","I'm trying to get troops to the South.","What are ''you'' doing?","Well, ''excuse me'', officer.","Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets.","I'm just trying to save the world.","I can't talk to you when you're like this.","Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick.","We can't wait for the President to act.","We need those troops ''now''.","I know General Iroh.","He might be willing to help us.","That's perfect!","You'll be making money for your company ''and'' you'll be helping to defeat Unalaq.","I don't understand why it's so hard to get Republic City to support the South.","Thank you for seeing me, General Iroh.","The South needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely, but the President is refusing to give the order.","So I decided to come to you directly.","I guess you wouldn't.","Thank you!","I ''hate'' that guy!","I understand.","Thanks anyway.","Thank you, General.","Bolin, I need you to watch Naga while I'm gone.","The Fire Nation.","I'm going to try to get them to help the South.","I need a boat.","He was going to help, but then President Raiko showed up.","Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't figure it out.","No one knew about it except for us and Asami.","Mako?","You ratted me out to the President?","Explain why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?","You betrayed me, and my family!","Well, I ''have'' a job to do too, only it seems like ''you're'' always standing in the way of me getting it ''done''!","So, what?","Are you breaking up with me?","Get away from me!","Who's-who's \"Avatar Korra\"?","I ... don't know.","I can't remember anything.","Raava.","Raava.","Raava.","Who are you?","Who am I?","I don't know what that is.","How do I regain my connection?","Are you Raava?","Raava.","I found you.","I remember.","My name is Korra.","I'm the Avatar.","Thank you for all your kindness.","I wonder how long I've been away.","I have to close the spirit portal before that happens.","Tenzin's itinerary.","We went over it like a hundred times before we left Republic City.","It's so great to see you all again.","Wait, you don't know about the Civil War?","So much.","I-I don't know where to start.","Everything?","Okay.","I opened a spirit portal at the South Pole, but then Unalaq turned out to be a bad guy and wanted to take control of the South, so I sort of started a Civil War, but when I went to find some help, I was attacked by my cousins, and then by a giant dark spirit, and then I forgot who I was, and then I met the first Avatar, and then I realized I shouldn't have opened the portal in the first place, and now I need to close it again!","Yes, and now I think my uncle is trying to free him.","This is all my fault.","Thank you.","I thought about that.","My best chance to close the portal is from the inside.","I have to enter the Spirit World.","Wow!","Spirit World, here we come.","I thought your bell ringing was just fine.","We could have tried a little longer.","I am focusing.","Okay, I feel it.","What's going on with you?","First, you're blaming Meelo, then Kya, and now me.","I don't want to rush your feelings, but we're kind of in a hurry.","How did you first get into the Spirit World?","Let's try that.","You've never been into the Spirit World?","Are they here to help?","No offense, but I'm guessing the spirits have actually been to the Spirit World, so I'm gonna follow them.","You have a natural gift.","That's pretty lucky.","It's a him, Avatar Wan.","He was amazing.","I saw how he became the first Avatar by fusing with Raava, the Spirit of Light.","When did this happen?","That's the day I opened the Southern portal.","Look.","There are carvings on them.","Not bats.","Dark spirits.","Unalaq may be a horrible person, but his spirit powers are no joke.","Everything Unalaq taught me was to help himself.","Everything you've done was meant to help me.","I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor.","I need you now more than ever.","Why don't you go first?","Tenzin, we're running out of time.","We'll be all right.","The Spirit World.","Just ... stick close to me, okay?","This seems nice, but you never know when we'll run into some dark spirits.","Huh!","Jinora, be careful!","Hold on!","Uh!","Sorry!","I'm the Avatar.","I'm trying to find the spirit portals?","I opened one- No, I did, but- B-because I was at the South Pole!","Get away from me!","Jinora!","Jinora!","Jinora?","Jinora!","Jinora.","Jinora.","Ahhh!","Get away!","I'm sorry I swatted you.","You just scared me.","I know you.","Iroh!","How can you marry each other?","Aren't you ... How long have you lived here?","I came here with my friend, but I lost her and now I'm all alone.","No!","It's not okay!","Jinora's gone and I need to find her!","She's lost, and we need to go home!","I don't like the Spirit World, I don't want to be here anymore!","I'm sorry.","I can make the sun shine?","I'm looking for my friend.","I want her here now!","Why didn't she come out like the sun?","But what am I supposed to do?","I'll take him home!","Where do I go?","This looks scary.","Will you come with me?","No!","Bye!","Okay, time for you to go home.","Light and peace ... light and peace ...","I'm not afraid of you.","You're not scary!","You just look that way.","I have light inside!","It's okay, you can be my friends.","My name is Korra, and I'm taking this dragon bird home!","Iroh said you could be nice.","Do you wanna help me?","All right, now let's close that portal and go find Jinora.","That's where Vaatu is.","I think you've said that before, Vaatu.","But I'm here to close the portal.","You're not getting out.","Jinora!","I can't believe I trusted you!","You made me think you wanted to restore balance with spirits, but this- this isn't balance, it's madness!","Now let her go!","Stop!","I'll do it.","Now let Jinora go.","Ahhh!","Ahhh!","Tenzin- I'm ...","I'm sorry.","I'm so sorry, Pema.","I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me.","President Raiko!","Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed.","Unalaq doesn't just wanna take over the South anymore.","He wants to destroy the whole world.","He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during Harmonic Convergence, which is only a few days away.","If he succeeds, the world as we know it, is over.","Sir, we desperately need your help.","Thank you.","It's so good to see you guys again.","Wait.","Where's Mako?","Mako, I've missed you so much.","Why would I be mad?","No, not really.","I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while.","Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.","Was it a bad fight?","Zhu Li's in prison with you?","You have a battleship?","It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing.","I hope my dad's all right.","I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock Vaatu in for another ten thousand years, and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born.","Thanks Mako.","Did you want something?","Mom!","Where's Dad?","I'll get him back.","I talked to the rebels.","They said Unalaq's got the southern portal surrounded.","Harmonic Convergence is only a few hours away.","There's no use in talking any more.","We know what our mission is.","What are you thinking?","Let's get moving.","There are spirits everywhere.","I don't see an opening.","Dad ... Don't give up.","Harmonic Convergence isn't here yet.","We still have a chance.","You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq.","Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful, it will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened over the last ten thousand years.","Even if Vaatu escapes, I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did.","Eska, Desna, listen to me.","You've got to help us stop Unalaq.","I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy.","Please.","If you let me out now, I can still stop him from destroying everything.","Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe.","Desna, he won't be your father anymore.","No, you're too hurt, you need a healer.","Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom?","This is my fight now.","I love you too, Dad.","Once we're inside, you go find Jinora.","Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq, while I close the portal so Vaatu can't escape.","If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after Harmonic Convergence.","If not ... Let's go.","Tenzin, go find Jinora!","I'm not going to let you fuse with Unalaq.","You're going right back in that prison.","Don't let Unalaq back in the Spirit World.","No!","I'm locking you away for another ten thousand years, Vaatu!","No!","Well I'm the old Avatar, and my era's not over yet!","Raava.","You cannot win.","Did you find Jinora?","She was right.","No.","They fused, then Vaatu ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her.","Vaatu won.","When Vaatu destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too.","The cycle is over.","I'm the last Avatar.","I'm so sorry, Tenzin.","No one can help me now.","How?","Haven't you heard anything I said?","Raava is gone.","I'm not connected to her spirit anymore.","Why are you showing me Vaatu's prison?","And, you think this tree can help me somehow?","These are my memories.","Avatar Wan.","But, he was brave, and ... smart, and always wanted to defend the helpless.","Everyone in Republic City is in danger.","How?","We're half-way around the world.","You really think I can do this?","Thank you for not giving up on me.","Raava!","Go in peace.","It's over.","I'm sorry about your father.","But he was already fused with Vaatu.","I couldn't save him.","No.","I think that link is gone, forever.","Maybe I shouldn't.","What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds?","What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals?","What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart?","Well, what do you think I should do?","Of course.","I remember.","I did, but being inside the Tree of Time brought it back.","I'm sorry for blowing up at you.","Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?","I think we both know that this.","Us?","Doesn't work.","It's over.","For real this time.","And I'll always love you.","The war of the Water Tribes is over.","Unalaq has been defeated, and the Northern fleet is returning home.","The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent, and the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new chief!","I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path.","So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open.","Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World, and spirits will be free to roam our world.","I will no longer be the bridge.","Humans and spirits must learn to live together.","My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance.","Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy.","I can feel it.","Things will never be the same again.","We're entering a New Age.","How are we ever gonna clear away all these vines?","Ugh, I don't get it.","I can vanquish Vaatu but not a bunch of stupid vines?","I don't think that the people who used to live here are as excited about it as you are.","I gotta go face the press and tell them I ''still'' don't have a way to get rid of the vines.","This should be fun.","Listen, I've been trying everything I can think of to get rid of these vines, but- Look, Harmonic Convergence was just a couple weeks ago.","I just needed a little more time to get everything back to normal.","Oh, I'm sorry.","Did I put you in a difficult position by fighting the giant force of pure evil that was going to destroy the whole world?","Maybe your administration could have handled that.","This is a disaster.","Easy for you to say.","You don't have my poll numbers.","Eight percent approval?","Who are they asking?","I don't blame them.","I should be able to fix this.","I'm the Avatar.","What's up with him?","''Still''?","Do you think being in the Spirit World during Harmonic Convergence could have given him bending?","Wait, we'll help you look for him.","Where should we start?","Okay.","How are you doing?","You know, you're welcome to stay here instead of sleeping at the police station.","This is so exciting!","New airbenders in the city.","I bet we can find that guy before Mako does.","You know I'm not very good at this.","How long do you think talking to Mako is gonna be like pulling teeth?","So, when I was gone, did he tell you that we broke up?","That's pretty embarrassing.","No wonder he's so nervous around us!","No!","I mean, I kissed Mako when he was going out with you, so ...","I'm so sorry!","I thought you knew!","Well, whatever happened with Mako, I'm glad it hasn't come between us.","I've never had a girlfriend to hang out with and talk to before, except for Naga.","This is nice.","What are you doing living in the middle of the road in the first place?!","Look, I don't have anything against spirits, but these vines are causing major problems all over the city!","I think that spirit just gave me an idea how to get rid of these vines ...","But I'm gonna need a lot of water.","I hope this works.","What are you guys doing here?","Go in peace.","Look out!","Let's go, people!","Hurry.","Hang on.","Can't talk.","Meditating.","I thought if I really tried I might be able to contact my past Avatars, someone who knows something to help me, but I can't.","They're gone and I'm all alone.","Did I ruin everything by leaving the spirit portals open?","I know the people's point of view.","It's bad.","Right.","It's scary.","I have all this power and all these people depending on me, but I don't know what I am supposed to be doing half the time.","It seems like I should be ... wiser.","Avatar wisdom is the thing of the past, Bolin.","Come on.","Depends who you ask.","Don't panic, I'm just here to talk.","Tell me about it.","Rough day, huh?","I'm having kind of a rough day myself.","You mind if I sit down here?","Look, I know you're scared.","You've gone through a big change and its kind of my fault.","But you're not alone, there are other airbenders and they want to help you.","Actually, they are really excited to meet you.","I'm sorry, I can't, but I promise you things will get better if you just give it a chance.","Let me take you over to Air Temple Island and we can talk this through.","Okay?","Daw, this is Tenzin.","He is going to help you.","Listen, I know you're having a tough time getting used to these changes and I'm sorry for that, but ''you'' and everyone else are going to have to learn live with it.","The vines and the spirits are here to stay.","Don't worry, I was already leaving.","I can see my path now.","There are new airbenders out there and I'm going to find them and rebuild the Air Nation.","It's perfect!","Thanks Asami.","Mako, I'm so glad you're here.","Right, the Avatar thanks you for your loyal service.","Did you find any more leads?","Actually, I was kind of hoping you could come, too.","I know things have been weird between us since we broke up, but you're a part of Team Avatar, and we can't do this without you.","We're going to bring the Air Nation back from the brink of extinction after nearly two hundred years.","Thanks.","Actually, this bald man does want to take him, but it's for an important cause.","Your dad is an airbender, and he should learn about his culture.","In my head, I saw that playing out very differently.","Okay, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding.","It's time for a little tough love.","How old is he?","Well, I have a great opportunity for him.","We're looking for airbenders to join us at the Northern Air Temple.","Hi, I'm Korra.","Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity.","Well, you're gonna be interested.","You're an airbender now and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world.","Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties.","Yes, I do have to.","Yes, I do!","Well, if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos.","Think about that!","Is that what you want?","No, it's not!","Everyone cares!","Yes, you do!","Well, you're about to care, you little slacker, because you're coming with me!","That's it!","I don't know what to do.","I just thought more people would be excited about coming with us.","It sounds ridiculous, but it might work.","I will.","With my airbending skills!","We got our first recruit.","Just to be totally clear, we're going to be heading to Ba Sing Se, then the Northern Air Temple to live as nomads and rebuild the Air Nation.","All that sound good to you?","We'll keep you safe, come on.","We are not running away from anyone.","If you want Kai, you'll have to go through me!","Your days of harassing an innocent boy is over.","You outlaws are going to prison.","Where's Kai?","Is that true?","Wait!","You've got the family's life savings, now let us take Kai.","He just needs some guidance, Tenzin.","Who better to give it to him than us?","Don't make me regret it.","It's so exciting to be on a diplomatic mission to Ba Sing Se.","What's the Earth Queen like?","I wonder how many airbenders are down there.","Uhh, the Lower Ring looks terrible.","Thank you.","Seems like an awful lot of rules.","Well, actually Your Majesty, I was hoping you could ... Well, I uh, I'm not sure what I can do about that.","I'm very sorry for your troubles, but actually ...","I don't really have servants.","But, Your Majesty, the reason for our visit is that we're trying to gather all of the new airbenders who are popping up in the Earth Kingdom, and we'd like your help finding the ones in Ba Sing Se.","Before we left Republic City we got some reports.","Oh, of course.","What is it?","Yes, Your Majesty.","There are royal guards waiting at the vault.","I doubt anything will happen.","I think Her Majesty likes ordering me around.","I don't like the looks of this.","Let's hurry up and get out of here.","Go ahead and load it on the airship.","Maybe we should have brought everybody else.","Sorry to disappoint you, but we're taking this gold back to Ba Sing Se.","Why do I get the feeling he's right?","So now, Your Majesty, if I could start meeting some of the airbenders here in the city.","You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens for your stupid palaces and topiaries and then you just want to send me away?","We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders!","We know there are some here!","This isn't over!","I'm going to find the airbenders!","I know that Earth Queen is lying to me!","I can tell by that stupid little queenly smirk of hers!","I can't believe I helped her.","I should have known she was using me!","Sorry.","She ''was'' lying.","I knew it!","I swear, the next time I see her- Thank you!","That is just the most wonderful news.","Ever.","Yay.","Uhh, this evening?","I'm not sure about leaving so soon- Thanks for buying us some time.","Those people should not be forced to join an army!","Don't worry, Jinora.","We'll find him.","We just need to figure out where to look.","Let's go get Kai out.","Let's get all the airbenders out.","What happened?","What did you see?","Jinora, you've read all about Ba Sing Se.","Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be?","Maybe there is.","How did you find me during Harmonic Convergence?","Maybe you can find Kai the same way.","I know you two have a connection.","I can't believe Miss Queeny Smug Face had them right under our noses the whole time!","Everyone, act natural.","And Bolin - What?!","What's going on?","Why is Lord Zuko with my dad?","All right, hold on!","Will you quit ignoring me and tell me what's going on?","Who's Zaheer?","Why is my life in danger?","So ''that's'' why you and my dad sheltered me away.","No ...","I'm not running.","Look, I'm not a little kid anymore.","You don't need to protect me.","I came here for one thing: to find airbenders.","And I'm not leaving without them.","In a military compound, and we're busting them out.","I'm the Avatar, and I'm getting you all out of here.","Yes, and we must leave now.","Come on!","It's clear.","These airbenders shouldn't be used as weapons!","They have a right to choose their own paths.","They're leaving with me!","Where are the others?","Good luck at the Northern Air Temple.","I'll send more airbenders your way when I find them.","I'll try.","Seems like wherever I go, I make a new enemy.","This is only the beginning.","Relax, we just got here.","Besides, no one knows where I am except us.","I think she wants you to throw it for her.","Finally!","Where are they?","You know the place?","Sorry, if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we are going next.","Why not?","Fine.","You got it, Chief Crankypants.","Thanks for having us.","Yup.","Just us.","So, can I meet the new airbender?","Wow.","Is this where the airbender lives?","Is this some kind of combat training?","So, you're a dancer.","What?","I, uh, I didn't.","I mean ... How did you know I was lying?","We came with Republic City's Chief of Police.","She didn't want anyone to know she was here.","I'm sorry I didn't tell you.","Wait, you two know each other?","No.","Why would she?","I found out why you're so against coming here.","Why didn't you ever tell me you had a sister?","You two haven't spoken in ''thirty'' years?","How come?","Lin, your niece is the new airbender!","Isn't that amazing?","Nice to meet you.","It's great to meet you, Opal.","Oh, I'm sorry.","But I was hoping she could train with the rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple.","I guess I could help her get started.","She's just a little worried because there's a bunch of crazy criminals after me.","Why do you have such a problem with your sister?","She seems nice.","Come on, we can stay a little while.","Okay.","Let's see what you've got.","That's okay.","I've never been a teacher before, so we're in the same boat.","You'd want to keep your elbows in, torso straight, feet just skimming the ground.","Why don't you try it with me?","Woah.","You're a natural.","Honestly, not great.","We had to rescue a whole group of them from the Earth Queen.","I ...","I haven't really thought about it too much.","Lin!","It's amazing.","Thank you for being so welcoming.","And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting.","Can I ask what happened with you two?","That sounds like a good thing.","It sounds like you've created the perfect life here.","Can I steal you away from Bolin for a minute?","I need you help with something.","Hey, it's me.","I brought someone who wants to talk to you.","What's your problem?","Don't get mad at Opal.","I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in.","But I guess I was wrong.","Su's right.","You're never going to change.","You're always gonna be a bitter, lonely woman.","I think she's still sulking in her room.","Um.","I don't think I'd be much competition, since I can't metalbend.","Nope.","And I guessed I never thought to bring it up because I was learning to airbend, then there was the pro-bending, then I got tied up fighting Equalists.","It was a busy few months.","Really?","That would be great!","That's amazing!","Okay.","Bolin?","Is that you?","What are you doing?","He's on your shoulder.","I can't believe it!","I'm metalbending!","Are you going to stay in your room feeling sorry for yourself all day?","You owe Opal an apology for the way you treated her last night.","Are you okay?","You don't look good.","Should I stop them?","Uhh, Whose going to knock?","Uhh, I can.","But I just thought that ... With Beifong's sister in Zaofu.","We're totally safe, unless we get caught in another fight between Su and Lin.","Not exactly.","We got a call about an airbender and it turned out to be Su's daughter Opal.","She'll be headed your way soon.","How's the training going?","You need to give yourself a break.","Let Jinora and the kids help you out, and what about Bumi?","He was a naval commander, maybe he has some ideas about how you get people motivated.","Yeah, but he loves to organize people.","If you ask him for help, you can trick him into taking more responsibility by making him think the whole thing with his idea.","Conflict resolution, that's what I do.","Woo-hoo!","Metalbending champion!","Wait, that can find airbenders?","The- the guards.","It had to be one of them.","Lin, stop!","Your sister was not involved!","This is a waste of time!","Just bring in the next guard!","That guard knows everything.","We have to get him to talk.","I don't know, but we all saw the evidence.","It's pretty overwhelming.","What do you think is down there?","We came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers.","We're just looking for answers.","I'm still a little new at this, so back off!","Ugh!","Look, he must've escaped through there!","Help me clear it out.","Your trusted adviser is the one who betrayed us.","He was lying about the guard.","We confronted him and he bolted through here.","This is where Zaheer got in and out.","Aiwei was the traitor.","That's why we have to find them.","We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei.","Naga can track his scent.","If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere.","I have to stop them!","Stop trying to protect me!","I'm the Avatar.","This is my job!","But ... they ... Fine, if you really think it's best.","Su.","Definitely.","What?","Why?","Let's get this guy!","Thanks.","Aiwei has definitely been through here.","Nice tracking, girl.","They weren't hers to keep!","I swear, if I see her pinchy little queen face again, I am going to ... Naga found something.","Oh ...","Sorry, I forgot to bring treats but, good girl.","I'm coming too.","All right.","I'm just frustrated.","What does Zaheer want with me?","What's his plan?","Xai Bau's Grove, sundown.","This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer!","That's great!","And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer.","There he is.","Okay, I'll put that on my to-do list, right after bringing back the Air Nation and taking down the group that tried to kidnap me.","Then I make him talk.","You have a better idea?","It's almost sundown.","Why hasn't Aiwei left yet?","I'm going over there.","It's over, Aiwei!","Where's ...?","What?","He's not sleeping.","He's meditating.","Wait!","Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier.","Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the physical world!","It's in the Spirit World!","I'm going in after him.","Zaheer!","That's right.","We knew he'd lead us straight to you.","Now, what did you do with him?","Don't move, Zaheer.","You're going to give me some answers.","First off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?","''Red'' Lotus?","Are you related to the White Lotus?","That's a great story, but it doesn't explain why you tried to take me when I was a kid.","What?","My uncle was part of the Red Lotus?","Avatar Wan wasn't foolish!","He was trying to restore balance.","So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu?","That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?","It sounds like you were just trying to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted.","If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when I was a kid, why wasn't he caught?","So he betrayed you, just like he betrayed me.","And what is your mission, exactly?","I don't think our ideas of balance are the same.","What do you mean?","No.","I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out world leaders isn't the answer.","But that won't bring balance.","It will throw the world into ''chaos''.","No.","Zaheer, please, as an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world, instead of destroying it.","Enough with your philosophical mumbo-jumbo!","I want to know one thing.","If you do capture me, what are you going to do with me?","Zaheer!","Zaheer, you tricked me!","Let me go!","Asami, are you okay?","Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?","Where are we?","You have to let me out!","The Earth Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus.","I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday.","He's insane!","Can I have ... some water?","I hoped Mako or Bolin would have shown up to save us by now.","I wonder if they're okay.","We have to find a way to get out of this prison before we get to the Earth Queen.","Guards!","Get in here!","Something happened to my friend.","She needs help.","Nice work.","Now let's take control of the ship.","Sorry, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk.","You're the engineer.","What do you think?","Can we get flying again?","Is everyone all right?","I'm sorry.","But I couldn't let you take me to the Earth Queen as a captive.","There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about.","I'm not waiting around for that.","We need to get out of here ''now''.","You realize that I'm the Avatar, right?","You don't want to fight me.","Oh right, so I guess that's my fault too.","Do you want to help us get this ship up and running, or do you want to wait around and meet ''that'' thing?","Everybody stand back.","I just airbent all the sand out of the engine room.","I think it's clean.","How's it going out here?","That's no spirit!","I think it's gone now.","How far are we from the edge of the desert?","It's worth a try.","No time for a test run.","Let's move!","I'm sorry for getting us stranded out there.","I didn't mean for that to happen.","Dhaaah!","Easy, girl.","Did you think we weren't coming back to you?","What are you all doing here?","Yeah, we made it out of the desert.","Thanks to Asami.","It's good to see you, Lord Zuko.","Yeah, sorry about that.","But, how did you all find us?","What about her?","The Red Lotus.","The name of the group that's been trying to capture me and just took out the Earth Queen.","I'm afraid this is only the beginning, Dad.","It's really good to see you, too.","Both of you.","Uhm, thanks.","You too?","What?","How did you escape?","What?","Why would he do that?","Zaheer's threatening innocent lives just to get to me.","We need to radio Tenzin and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming.","Let's go.","We'll radio Su on the way.","Hopefully she can get a hold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu.","Did you have any luck getting through to Tenzin?","I can't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the Northern Air Temple.","We have to do something.","There might be another way to stop him.","It's a long shot, but Zaheer is always meditating into the Spirit World.","And I know exactly where he goes: Xai Bau's Grove.","If I can find him there, maybe I could somehow trap him.","I'll be fine.","I have to try.","Zaheer!","Come out!","Face me!","Leave the airbenders out of this!","There you are.","Iroh?","What are you doing here?","I am.","There's a maniac on the loose and he's threatening to destroy the new Air Nation.","I don't know what to do.","I know many Avatars have needed guidance.","But I'm the only one since Avatar Wan that can't get help from my past lives.","I wish I could talk to Aang.","Lord Zuko, of course.","Thank you!","Thank you so much.","You're right about the Spirit World.","I came here looking for someone else, but I'm glad I found you.","No, he wasn't there.","But there's someone I need to talk to.","You're leaving?","Aren't you coming to the air temple with us?","I understand.","You have to keep the Fire Lord safe.","But before you leave, I was wondering if you could help me with something.","That just it.","You knew Aang better than anyone.","I was wondering if you knew what he might do if he were in my situation.","So he would give himself up to save the Air Nation?","Thanks.","Your uncle was right.","It was helpful talking to you.","Yes.","In the Spirit World.","A couple of times actually.","Meelo, this is your commanding officer.","Go get your dad, now!","Come on, come on!","Tenzin!","Listen to me carefully.","Zaheer is on his way to the temple.","He's coming for the airbenders.","You have to get everyone out of there immediately.","Drop everything.","Leave!","Now!","What?","What is it?","Tenzin!","Tenzin, what's happening?!","It doesn't matter.","None of these ideas will work.","The second Zaheer realizes we're up to something, he'll wipe out the airbenders.","Then I'll think you agree that the only plan that will work is for me to give myself up.","I talked it over with Lord Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought.","I have to do this.","The world has been out of balance for far too long: it needs the Air Nation back again.","I can't let Zaheer destroy it and everyone we love.","Help me save the airbenders, then you can worry about saving me.","I'll go radio Zaheer.","Zaheer, are you there?","It's me.","Yes.","You release the airbenders, and then I'll turn myself over.","Yes.","He told me to come to the top of Laghima's Peak at noon, alone.","Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple.","You too.","Don't worry, Dad.","I'll be all right.","I love you, Dad.","And Dad, watch out for Zaheer.","He's not very fond of world leaders.","Mako, did you see the airbenders?","Mako, what's going on?","Tell Ghazan to let the airbenders go.","No!","Wait.","I'm coming.","We had a deal!","Dad!","You.","You killed my father!","No!","The Avatar Cycle.","Dad.","You're alive.","It's great.","Thanks.","You're right.","Okay, let's go.","Is that all you got?","Thanks.","I get that a lot.","I wouldn't know.","Knock yourself out.","Huh?","You again.","No, I-I don't need any help.","Thanks.","That's sweet.","No ...","I appreciate it, but I'll only be gone a couple of weeks.","A little time alone will be good for me.","All right ...","I'll go.","Can you fix it?","That's what I want.","More than anything!","Did you see that?","It worked!","What's the point?","We've been at this for almost six months and I can still ''barely'' take a couple of steps without collapsing!","''Of course'' I'm frustrated!","A crazy man poisoned me and now I can't dress myself, or cook for myself, o-or do ''anything'' for myself!","And this whole time, my friends have been off ''helping'' the world while I'm stuck with you ''and you can't even heal me''!","That came out wrong.","I am trying to understand ''why'' this happened to me, but nothing makes any sense!","I'm tired, Katara.","I'm ''so'' tired.","And ... what am I going to find if I ... get through this?","Yes.","Where'd you come from, little cutie?","How'd you do that?","You want me to follow you?","All right.","Let's see what I find.","It's ''so'' good to see you!","I ''feel'' great!","Come on, I want to show you how much better I'm doing.","Attack!","I can take it!","I thought I was ready.","But that should be ''me ''out there fixing things, not ''her''.","If you say, \"be patient\", I swear I'm gonna water-smack you in the mouth!","Dear Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written to you sooner, but every time I've tried, I never know what to say.","The past two years have been the hardest of my life.","Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State.","I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day.","Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head, so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover.","Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them.","I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff.","I don't think they'd understand.","There's something I need to tell you both.","I want to go back to Republic City.","I know I'm not a hundred percent yet, but I feel like I've hit a wall.","I need to be where the action is, where my friends are.","No, I want to go alone and have some time to clear my head.","It'll be good for me.","Two lobster crabs, please.","Yup, that's me.","Well, uhm, I'm kind of in a hurry.","Hand over the bags or else.","I was hurt pretty bad a while ago and lost touch with my Avatar Spirit.","I came to the Tree of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again.","But it's not working.","The last time I was here, I saw ''all sorts'' of visions.","Now I don't see anything.","I'm sorry, but for years, people have been saying they can help me get better.","Nothing's worked.","I need to figure this out on my own.","I am ending this.","Excuse me.","Who do I talk to about getting in the ring?","Is that all you got?","Why did you bring me to the swamp?","Wait, I met you at the Tree of Time.","You should have told me who you were.","I get your point.","But why did you bring me here?","What am I gonna find in the swamp?","No, wait!","Come back!","You're just in my mind.","You're ''not'' real.","''Help''!","Where am I?","Wha-what happened?","How'd you know I was out there?","A spirit led me here and told me I was supposed to find someone.","Is that you?","Wait, you recognize me?","You got to help me get back into Avatar fighting shape.","I'm getting my butt kicked by losers all over the Earth Kingdom.","The world needs me.","But, while I've been the Avatar, I've stopped some ''really'' bad people from doing some ''really'' bad things.","So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless.","And I thought Beifong was grumpy.","So ... you're not going to train me?","Thank you!","Well, I was thinking that you were ... Gah!","Hey!","It seems like you're enjoying having someone around to beat up an awful lot.","So ... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the world?","That was terrible.","You were tossing me around like a ragdoll all day long.","I just don't understand why I can't get back to my former self.","It's like ...","I'm a step slower.","I'm tentative, I'm out of sync, I just can't get back in the groove.","What metal?","I thought Su got it all out.","That's been my problem this entire time!","I gotta get it out!","You can get it out for me, right?","I am relaxed.","Just do it!","I'm ready.","I'm not fighting!","What do you mean?","Why would I want poison inside me?","Wait!","What am I supposed to do now?","So ... what's the plan for today?","We didn't do anything yesterday, or the day before that.","I know!","Tell me the story of how you taught Aang how to earthbend.","I thought there'd be more to it than that.","What about the time you took down the Fire Lord?","That must have been ''epic''!","Okay, you're terrible at telling stories.","You got it.","No ... this swamp ... it did crazy things to my mind.","I had visions, of all the times my enemies hurt me.","''What''?","You wanted me to see those visions?","You are one ''twisted'' old lady, you know that?","Okay, swamp.","I'm all ears.","I don't know.","Because they made ''me'' and a lot of other people suffer.","Sounds like the swamp is messing with your mind too.","I guess ...","Okay, fine.","But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me.","Maybe you're right, but how am I supposed to move on?","It's beautiful.","I can't believe it!","I saw Jinora, Ikki and Meelo, they're here!","I missed you so much, too.","How did you find me all the way out here?","I'm so sorry.","This is Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki.","Aang and Katara's grandchildren.","I don't know ...","I'm not the Avatar I used to be.","I can't even go into the Avatar State.","All right.","I'm ready.","I feel so much lighter.","Thank you ''so'' much for helping me.","I'd like to give you a hug now, if that's okay with you.","If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I.","She needs to know that the Avatar is back.","The ''world'' needs to know.","Oh, no.","I hope we're not too late.","I'll tell you the whole story later.","Right now, I want to help you stop Kuvira.","What can I do?","How did things get so bad between you and Kuvira?","I thought she was your prot\u00e9g\u00e9.","What happened?","I want to fix this.","Fighting is something the ''old'' me would do.","That always made things worse.","Let me talk with Kuvira.","Maybe I can reason with her.","Well, I'm feeling much better now.","I'm here to ask you to back down.","Please.","Take your army and leave.","I can't let you take Zaofu.","What you're doing isn't right!","I know what that's like.","I've had plenty of people mad at me about decisions I've made.","Maybe that ''will'' be for the best.","Where's Su?","I have to talk to her.","''No!''","We have no idea where your mom is, or what her plan is.","If we go charging into Kuvira's camp, we could get them all captured, or worse.","All we can do now is wait.","No, Jinora is right.","Your mom attacked the camp.","Kuvira was just defending herself.","Jinora and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and, maybe, we can work something out.","I promise, I'll do everything I can to keep the peace.","I can't risk anyone else being captured.","You can stay with Baatar and Huan while I work things out with Kuvira.","Make sure they get back to Tenzin if anything goes wrong.","There must be some way for us to resolve this!","I can't just let you take the city!","It looks like you're not giving me a choice.","Fine.","You wanna fight the Avatar?","Then let's finish this, ''right here, right now.''","Just stay back and let me handle this.","It's been a while, but I got a lot of pent-up rage.","No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort.","Enough talk!","No!","Stay back!","I can handle this.","Naga!","I missed you so much, girl!","It's so great to see you again, Bumi.","And you too, Bum-Ju.","I missed you, Tenzin.","I thought I was strong enough to stop her.","I feel like such a failure.","I hope you haven't been waiting long.","You too.","Thanks.","You're looking snazzy as always.","Hi, Mako.","Nope.","Not a thing.","What?","No!","I wrote to Asami while I was away.","I asked her not to tell you.","I'm sorry.","I don't know.","I guess ...","I didn't know what to say.","I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch, but I'm back now.","And I wanna know everything about what's been going on with you two.","You sure you can trust him?","He might just be manipulating you again.","No, I didn't mean ...","It's not like I planned to be gone for that long, I wanted to come back, but I never felt ready until now.","Do you always go to the bathroom with him?","I'll be right back.","Excuse me, did you happen to see if Prince Wu came out this way?","They've got Wu!","Get the car, I'm going after them!","We're losing them!","Where is he?","Wu's not here.","This guy was the only one in the truck.","They're taking Wu to the train station!","I'll explain on the way, just drive!","We're running out of time!","I learned how to connect to people's energies through them.","Lin's mom.","I found her in the swamp, that place is like one giant spirit wild.","A cranky, more miserable version of Lin.","You'd be surprised.","I don't know!","He's on that train!","I don't.","But I had a feeling, okay?","It's certainly not mine!","Everyone out.","Jump!","Really?","You're asking me out right now?","How about a never?","Not exactly what I imagined for our first day back together.","I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.","There's no place else I'd rather be.","So, what are we gonna do with him?","It's too dangerous to take him back to the hotel.","Mako?","Wow, I-I heard you play on the radio!","So, I was thinking we should spend some time together.","Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other.","Save your breath.","You've already made it clear how you feel about me.","I'm fine.","I'm glad you're here.","I love you, too.","Of course you take his side.","You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.","How could you take his side?","Well, excuse ''me'', officer!","Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets!","I'm just trying to save the world!","So, what?","Are you ... breaking up with me?","Mako, I missed you so much!","Not really.","I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while.","Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.","Was it a bad fight?","Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?","I think we both know that this ... us ... doesn't work.","It's ... over.","For real this time.","You're so sweet.","Thanks.","Sorry.","I've just been thinking about something Toph said.","She told me that the world doesn't need me and it's basically ''pointless'' to try and stop Kuvira.","At the time, I thought so, too.","I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self.","But I'm beginning to think she had a point.","But no matter what I do, the world seems to always be out of balance!","Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar.","I thought I was ''really'' gonna change things.","I was ''so'' naive.","The first time I saw Amon take someone's bending away, I was terrified.","Then my worst nightmare came true.","No!","Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the Spirit and human worlds into chaos.","It was my fault he fused with Vaatu and became a Dark Avatar.","And I was helpless to stop him from destroying Raava and cutting off my connection to my past lives.","With Raava gone, Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever.","Yeah ... that ''was'' pretty awesome.","Yes, ''but'' Zaheer got airbending too and nearly killed me.","If it weren't for Zaheer, the Earth Queen would still be alive.","There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom and Kuvira wouldn't be in power.","Things are more out of balance than ''ever'' now.","Nothing's changed!","I am?","Thank you both.","I know this Kuvira problem is only going to get worse.","But no matter what happens, no matter how ''crazy'' things get, I'll ''always'' try to restore balance.","This place is even more amazing than I imagined!","Korra.","Everything okay?","We ''all'' care.","Don't worry, we'll get them back safely.","Yeah, but it's Ryu.","They might be at the mall, for all we know.","No ... but maybe I can get a reading.","It was Kuvira.","I saw her taking vines from the swamp.","It must be affecting our Spirit Wilds.","I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora.","Whatever the reason, I'm sure it's not good.","You invited ''him'', but not me?","Again, ''him'', not me?!","And let me guess: it has something to do with spirit vines.","I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from the swamp.","We all were.","If ''anyone'' has lost people's trust, it's me.","Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt, no one even wants me around.","We gotta get in there and find Jinora.","I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be, but I can ''do'' this.","Jinora!","Come on!","It's Jinora and the rest of them.","Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World.","Wait ... this isn't the Spirit World.","Zaheer!","No!","No ...","I got it out!","It's Zaheer.","He's been haunting me ever since I fought him.","I can't get any peace.","It's like he's blocking me from meditating into the Spirit World.","I want to face Zaheer.","I ''need'' to if I wanna save Jinora and the others.","There's no other way.","You've lost faith in me, too, haven't you?","No one thinks I'm capable of anything anymore.","I know I can do this.","Tenzin, please.","I'll be okay.","Thank you.","Yes.","I think if I see Zaheer chained up, I'll finally realize that he's not a threat anymore.","No.","I need to do this alone.","I came here to look you in the eye and tell you that you have ''no'' power over me.","I will no longer be scared of you.","This was a mistake.","You don't know anything about me!","''You'' can meditate into the Spirit World from ''here''?","Doesn't feel very spiritually charged.","No, my problem is you!","You poisoned me!","You've ''ruined'' me!","People used to think I was unstoppable, but now they don't think I'm capable of anything!","I thought seeing you face-to-face would put an end to all of this.","But maybe it's time I realize I'll never be the same.","I'm not holding myself down, but my powers have limits!","Whatever.","''Before'', you were always talking about chaos and freedom.","Then you took out the Earth Queen and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen.","''Thanks'' for that!","Well, I ''can't'' stop her unless I get over this block.","No way.","I can't trust you.","I've come this far.","What have I got to lose?","I can't!","I have no control!","I made it ... and ''you'' led me here.","Do you know where Jinora and the others are?","Raava, I missed you.","Where have you been?","Can you help me find Jinora?","How do I release their spirits?","But I'm ''powerless'' in the Spirit World.","I feel ... ''whole'' again.","I feel good.","No.","But I ''am'' finally able to accept what happened and I think that's gonna make me stronger.","''No.''","It was Kuvira's harvesting of the vines in the swamp that caused the Republic City vines to go crazy and grab all those people.","I won't do that.","But maybe since the spirits love Republic City so much, I can convince them to help us defend it somehow.","Excuse me, spirit?","Can I talk to ... and you're gone.","Just like all the other spirits.","They're abandoning the city.","Spirits, this is the Avatar.","Please listen to me.","Since I opened the portals, spirits and humans have lived happily together in Republic City.","It's all I could have hoped for.","I know you felt the effects of Kuvira cutting down spirit vines.","But now isn't the time for you to flee the city.","It's time for you to help me save it from Kuvira, who was perverting spirit power to use as a weapon against other humans.","Spirits worked with Unalaq.","No, but as the Avatar, I'm hoping that you will come to my aid to save the new world we all share.","Wait!","Please, listen.","If spirits and humans are gonna live together, we have to work with each other!","How's the evacuation coming?","Only ''eighteen''?","There are ''millions'' of people in this city!","Su ... what are you ... you're okay!","I'm so sorry about Zaofu.","How did you escape?","Then we'll cut the rail lines.","Don't worry Mr. President.","I won't let Kuvira take our city.","There's something we need to discuss with you.","The four of us have been talking and ... we wanna take out Kuvira's spirit weapon before it gets ''too'' close to the city.","I know Iroh can go toe-to-toe with Kuvira's army, but that weapon ... We'll sneak behind enemy lines and disable the weapon.","It's worth the risk.","We'll head out tonight.","Kuvira.","She's already crossed into United Republic territory.","She's a week early.","It's Kuvira.","Our intel was wrong.","She must have known Zhu Li had the information.","Kuvira's army is only a few hours away.","And that spirit weapon of hers is attached to a giant mecha suit.","It's over twenty-five stories tall!","I'll head to the front lines and help General Iroh.","I'm not surrendering!","I will.","Raiko surrendered.","It's down to us now.","That's it!","Baatar Jr. built it, he'll know how to take it down!","I say we capture him, and get him to talk.","I know it's a long shot, but it's the only chance we have, and if we don't ... We'll need a stealth team of airbenders to get in and out of Baatar's airship unnoticed.","Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai, let's get moving.","Sorry, buddy.","This mission counts on everyone being as silent as possible - - and your farts are just too much of a wild card.","Is everyone ready?","That's why, before she finds out, you're going to tell us how to stop that mecha giant, or else.","We've been going about his all wrong.","You're right.","I'm not gonna physically hurt you if you don't talk.","But there is something I could do that will be even more painful.","I will take away the one thing you care for the most ...","''Kuvira.''","Kuvira might win.","She might chase us out of the city.","But you won't be around to enjoy the victory.","Because wherever I run, I'll take you.","I am going to make it my life's mission to never let you see the one you love again.","Is taking the city worth losing Kuvira forever?","''I will'' ... unless you convince Kuvira to back off.","You two will still have the Earth Empire.","Just leave the United Republic alone.","As soon as we work out terms with Kuvira, we'll let you out of here.","Everyone out!","Now!","''Now!''","I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu.","I'm not letting her conquer Republic City.","The world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.","Lin!","Su, you take Baatar Jr. and the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office.","Get those suits working as soon as you can.","The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own.","Everyone retreat!","Take the wounded back to Asami's office!","You think you know how to defeat this thing?","But how are we supposed to get inside?","We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits.","It looks like they're our only hope.","How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?","Get out there as soon as you can.","Thanks.","We may not be able to beat that thing, but we ''can'' slow it down.","Let's go!","Hiroshi's plan worked.","There's our opening.","We need to move fast.","Su, Lin, climb up to the arm and try to disable that weapon.","Mako, Bolin, get to the engine and see if you can power this thing down.","I'm going after Kuvira.","I know.","She almost destroyed me.","Not this time.","Stop!","Kuvira!","Give up!","Please, stop this madness!","It has to end now!","''Don't!''","Shut it down!","No, we're okay, but we're in the Spirit World.","All the energy from your weapon tore open a new portal and blasted us in here.","I guess ...","I see a lot of myself in you.","You brought this on yourself.","Messing with the spirit vines, acting like a dictator over your people ... you ''had'' to know what you were doing wasn't right.","I think I get it now.","I do.","Su told me how she took you in when you were younger.","It must have been ''so'' hard being an orphan.","You wanted to create a place where you and your people would never be vulnerable again.","I may not have been an orphan, but believe me, I understand what it feels like to be afraid.","After I was poisoned, I would have done anything to feel in control.","Good to see you, Prince Wu.","Or should I say, King Wu?","You ready to get back to Ba Sing Se and finally take the throne?","I think it's a great idea.","The Earth Kingdom ''should'' evolve, and I'll do everything in my power to help you make that happen.","How's the arm?","The words \"thank you\" don't feel big enough for what you did.","But I honestly don't know what else to say.","I bet Aang never could have imagined there'd be a spirit portal right in the heart of Republic City.","But I feel like I've only just begun.","There's so much more I want to learn and do.","It's been a bit of a bumpy ride, huh?","I know I was in a pretty dark place after I was poisoned.","But I finally understand why I had to go through all that.","I needed to understand what true suffering was so I could be more compassionate to others, even to people like Kuvira.","Wanna sit with me for a minute?","I'm not ready to get back to the party just yet.","I don't think I ever really apologized.","For being gone all that time.","For not coming back sooner.","I am ''so'' sorry for what happened.","So, what now?","Back to the dance floor?","Let's do it!","Let's go on a vacation, just the two of us.","Anywhere you want.","Sounds perfect."]},"Firebending master":{"combined_dialog":["You're getting ahead of yourself ''as usual'', Korra.","We haven't decided if you passed your firebending test

action after that hiccup, but I'm not so sure this replacement player knows what she's doing.","Wait a minute!","Did that waterbender just ''earthbend''?","Did I see that right?","Hold on, folks, we're just waiting for the referee's official call, but ... I-I think this replacement player could be ... no, there's no way!","This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no pro-bender and the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness!","They're giving her their best, and her best ain't good enough to stop it!","Aaaaand she's in the drink.","The Platypus Bears come out of the gate and quickly go after the Ferret brothers!","They're corralled in the corner, wedged in the edge of zone one, unable to come to the Avatar's rescue!","And boy, does she need it!","Looks like the Avatar's pro-bending debut is going to be cut short!","She's been pushed back to zone three, and the water is calling her name!","It's only a matter of time before ...","Hold the phone!","Stop the presses!","She's still in the game, folks!","And she's moving like an entirely different player!","All of a sudden, the Platypus Bears' strikes are only striking air!","The Platypus Bears have no juice left, but Mako and Bolin are still fresh and juicy!","Knockout!","The Fire Ferrets come from ''waaay'' behind and steal the win!","What an upset, folks!","The rookies, Avatar in tow, have nabbed a place in the championship tournament!","I can ''not'' believe it!","A chance encounter turns Korra from pro-bending spectator to pro-bending star.","With her new teammates, Mako and Bolin, the Fire Ferrets earn a place in the championship tournament.","But meanwhile, an anti-bending revolution brews in Republic City.","Who are the Equalists?","And what nefarious plan does the mysterious man behind the mask have in store for our hero?","Benders be on alert.","After coming face to face with Amon, leader of the Equalists, Avatar Korra discovers a terrifying truth: this masked mad man has the ability to take away a person's bending, permanently.","Benders of Republic City are counting on their young Avatar.","But is she prepared to face such a frightening foe?","Love is in the air!","Since Avatar Korra has arrived in Republic City she's only had eyes for one fellow: Mako.","The feeling seemed mutual until a fateful accident intervened.","Now Mako's affections have fallen right into the arms of the beautiful Asami.","Will love prove to be Korra's most formidable foe yet?","Folks, after a year of waiting the Pro-bending Championship is finally here.","Tonight is the first set of matches in our single elimination sixteen team bracket.","And I gotta tell ya, these are the most tenacious and talented bending trios this arena has ever seen.","What an explosive opening volley.","Both teams quickly recover and unleash a barrage of bending.","I am astonished with the level of improvement displayed here by the Fire Ferrets.","No wonder the Avatar has been absent from the papers lately.","She's obviously had her nose to the grindstone in the gym.","The Ferrets advance into Rabaroo territory and are holding nothing back.","Nice sprawl there by Mako.","Bolin strikes, Ula dodges, and all three Rabaroos are down.","The Fire Ferrets easily take round one!","The Rabaroos are looking for payback and they go straight after Bolin.","Korra comes to his defense and water-whacks Umi back into zone two!","The Ferrets are on fire tonight and they win round two.","With the Rabaroos down two rounds they'll need a knockout to win, and with the way the Fire Ferrets are playing I don't see that happening.","These Ferrets are working together like a well-oiled bending machine.","Bolin passes Adi back into zone two and the Ferrets get the green light to advance.","The Rabaroos are just fighting to stay at their feet at this point.","Out goes Adi, and Ula, and Umi!","Eight teams have been eliminated and eight advance into the quarter finals, which get underway way tonight.","The rookies are about to take on the former and longest-reigning champs, the Boar-q-pines.","Youth clashes against experience in a battle for the ages, or rather ''of'' the ages.","Korra dodges and, ''ooh'', slams right into her teammate!","Down goes Mako and Bolin and Korra!","The Ferrets looking to mount some offense here in round two.","Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks, he's a one-man bending battalion.","The Ferrets are having a rough time finding their rhythm tonight, but thanks to Bolin, they narrowly notch round two.","Not sure what's eating them, but this is not the same team who took out the Rabaroos.","Looks like the earthbenders will collide in the tie-breaker face-off.","Bolin goes in for the grapple, Chang reverses.","Bolin strikes from midair, knocking Chang to the edge of the circle.","Another strike from Bolin, and Chang is in the drink!","Oh, that was a close one folks!","Youth trumps experience tonight.","You can't find two teams more evenly matched in age, size, and strength than the Fire Ferrets and the Buzzard Wasps.","Believe me, I've looked!","This should be a pulse-pounding semifinal, folks!","The Buzzard Wasps open with a flawlessly executed combo.","All three Ferrets take an early visit to zone two.","And Mako is knocked all the way back into zone three!","The Fire Ferrets have been struggling to stay alive since the opening bell.","All three players are totally out of sync tonight.","Ooh, that has got to sting!","And Bolin loses his noodles!","Literally.","Which reminds me, this match is brought to you by our sponsor, Flameo Instant Noodles!","Noodliest noodles in the United Republic.","The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper into Ferret territory.","And Mako plunges into the pool!","Can the Fire Ferrets hold on?","The Wasps have the Ferrets backed up to the edge now ... and the Ferrets are bailed out by the bell!","They had better pull themselves together for round two, otherwise they can kiss the finals goodbye.","The Wasps take advantage of Mako's unforced error and Bolin is in the pool!","Ooh, and a blatant hold by the Avatar!","And the Avatar is slapped with the yellow fan.","The Ferrets are their own worst enemy right now.","It's just sad to watch.","With the Buzzard Wasps leading two rounds to zilch, the Ferrets' only hope of winning is with a knockout.","Bolin's knocked into zone two, followed quickly by his brother!","And Bolin takes a zinger to the shoulder!","Looks like it's a clean hit.","Mako's in the drink and out of the match.","And Bolin keeps playing with one good arm!","I gotta hand it to him, this kid's got grit!","But how long can he keep it up?","Apparently, not very long.","The Ferrets' dream of making it to the finals now rests in the Avatar's hands.","But with three on one, I don't like her odds.","What an unbelievable effort here by Korra!","She's dodging every element the Wasps throw at her!","The Avatar finally gains some ground, but with only ten seconds remaining, it might be too little too late!","It's the big kibosh!","What a knockout!","It didn't seem possible, folks, but the Fire Ferrets are headed to the finals!","With a brutal round one knockout, the defending champs secure their spot in the finals.","I hope the Ferrets know a good doctor, 'cause they're gonna need one!","After a close encounter with Amon, Korra took a leave of absence from Tarrlok's task force.","But the Avatar has still been hard at work, leading the underdog Fire Ferrets to the pro-bending championship finals.","Only one team stands in their way: the Wolfbats!","Led by team captain Tahno, the brutal Wolfbats look to repeat as champs.","Have the Fire Ferrets finally met their match?","The anticipation is palpable as we are just moments away from the championship match.","Will the Wolfbats' ferocity help them repeat as champs?","Or will the underdog Fire Ferrets serve up a surprising bowl of smackdown soup?","The champs and challengers face off at the center-line and here we go!","Tahno tries to clean the Avatar's clock with some dirty water boxing.","Ming shakes off Mako's attack and returns the favor.","Shaozu gets fancy, but Bolin ricochets a disk off the ropes and says 'No, thank you sir!'","The waterbenders slug it out, looking evenly matched.","Tahno gets a little too worked up and unleashes a deluge on Bolin that would certainly elicit a foul.","Or apparently not.","And the Wolfbats advance despite Tahno exceeding the waterbending time limit.","A questionable call by the officials.","Ming trips up Mako with another dirty trick!","The Ferret brothers are backed up to zone three and the Wolfbats smell blood.","Looks like Tahno snuck in an illegal icing move but once again there's no call.","I don't know what match the refs are watching but it's obviously not this one.","Oh ... a splash-and-clash sends the Avatar to zone three as well.","It's a knockout!","The Wolfbats win the championship for the fourth year in a- Hold on a second, folks!","Scratch that!","The Ferrets are still alive, but just barely.","What an unbelievable move!","These Ferrets aren't just bending the elements, they're bending my mind!","The underdogs survive to see round two.","The opening salvo is a brutal call as both sides give it their all.","But once again, Tahno sneaks in a little ice to get the upper hand.","Wowzers!","Those look like illegal head shots to me!","One round apiece: who wants it more?","The Wolfbats fly out of the gates, swinging with bad intentions.","The challengers are showing a lot of heart but the champs are really starting to find their rhythm now.","Can the Ferrets hang in there with the best, especially when the best are ''frankly'' getting a little help from the refs?","It's all down to this final round!","Mako is leaving it all in the ring but it looks like Tahno and Ming are up to more shenanigans!","Oh, this has gone too far!","That water had rocks in it!","Well, folks it's a controversial call but the Wolfbats notch a nasty knockout to win the match!","For the fourth year in a row, they'll be crowned tournament champions.","Folks, there is some sort of electrical disturbance in the stands.","Metalbender cops are dropping like bumbleflies.","There appear to be masked members of the audience wielding strange devices on their hands.","One of them is in the booth with me right now, folks!","He is leveling one of those glove devices at me now and I believe he is about to electrocute me.","I am currently wetting my pants.","Republic City is at war!","After discovering that her father, Hiroshi Sato, is working with the enemy, Asami turns against him, and following another defeat at the hands of the Equalists, Lin Beifong resigns as Chief of Police.","With the Equalist army growing stronger, who will help the Avatar stop Amon and restore balance to the city?","The Avatar has been abducted!","After Tarrlok arrested her friends, Korra confronted the councilman in his chambers.","But the heated argument quickly turned into an all-out bending battle!","Desperate to save himself, Tarrlok revealed his ability to bloodbend and took Korra far from Republic City.","Will the Avatar's friends find her before it's too late?","Amon's revolution grows stronger by the day.","First, he attacked the bending arena!","Then it was discovered that Hiroshi Sato was the mastermind behind the Equalist gloves and mecha tanks!","And most recently, Amon ambushed Councilman Tarrlok, took his bending, and nearly captured the Avatar as well!","Everyone is on edge, wondering where will Amon strike next?","The Equalists are on the attack!","The Lieutenant and his chi blockers invaded Air Temple Island and forced Tenzin and his family to flee!","In the daring escape, Lin Beifong sacrificed herself and saved the airbenders, but she was captured and Amon took her bending away.","Now, Team Avatar is in hiding as they await help from General Iroh and the United Forces.","Korra and Mako have discovered the truth about Amon's identity.","He's a waterbender, a bloodbender, and brother to Tarrlok!","Now, Korra and Mako plan to infiltrate the Equalists' victory rally and expose Amon as a fraud.","Meanwhile, Asami, Bolin, and General Iroh head toward Hiroshi's secret airfield, where Asami intends to take down her father?","Six months ago, Avatar Korra defeated Amon and the Equalists.","Since then the council was disbanded and the United Republic elected its first president.","Tenzin's brother, Commander Bumi, retired and moved to Air Temple Island.","And Korra and her boyfriend Mako have been the talk of the town.","Peace has come to Republic City, but unbeknownst to the Avatar, danger now threatens the Southern Water Tribe.","Iiiiit's pro-bending night in Republic City, and have we got a ''doozy'' for ''you''!","Fan favorites, the Fire Ferrets, are about to take on hot newcomers, the Rhino Lions!","The Southern Water Tribe is under siege!","When Avatar Korra was attacked by a dark spirit, Chief Unalaq was the only one able to stop it.","So, Korra turned her back on Tenzin and chose Unalaq as her new spiritual mentor.","Tenzin and his family left for a vacation at the Southern Air Temple, while Korra remained in the Water Tribe.","Will she be able to restore balance between humans and spirits?","Korra has reopened the Southern spirit portal and taken the first step to restoring balance between spirits and man.","Meanwhile, tensions are high between Korra and her father after she discovered he was hiding a dark secret.","Years ago, Tonraq was banished from the North.","And now the Northern navy has landed on Southern shores.","What other plans does Unalaq have for the Avatar?","Tensions between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes have reached a breaking point.","After Chief Unalaq's troops took over the South, Varrick incited an uprising.","But Korra stopped the rebels from abducting her uncle.","Enraged by the insurrection, Unalaq arrested the rebels and Korra's parents, accusing them of conspiring to assassinate him.","Will Korra be able to save her parents and prevent civil war?","It's brother versus brother in the war of the Water Tribes.","After Korra discovered that Chief Unalaq betrayed her and her father, she turned against him, sparking civil war.","The Southern rebels rallied around Tonraq, but they are vastly outnumbered, so Korra is headed to Republic City to seek aid.","But will she be able to convince President Raiko to send troops to help the South?","Folks, that cheer you're hearing is for local favorite, Bolin, of the Fire Ferrets.","Let's see if we can get a quick interview.","Bolin!","Bolin, the Fire Ferrets are out for the season.","How have you been spending your time lately?","Do you miss being in the ring?","Someone has attacked the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center.","All the evidence points to Northern sympathizers, but Mako suspects there's more to this case.","Meanwhile, Varrick has cast Bolin as the hero of his newest mover.","Asami has also ventured into business with Varrick, and a shipment of her mecha tanks is on its way to help the South in its war against Unalaq.","The Avatar has gone missing.","After President Raiko refused Korra's request to aid the South in the war of the Water Tribes, she headed to the Fire Nation, seeking a new ally against Unalaq.","But unbeknownst to her friends, a dark spirit attacked Korra and dragged her into the ocean.","She has washed up on a desolate island with no memory of who she is.","Avatar Korra has lost her memory!","In order to restore it, she has connected with Wan, who would become the very first Avatar.","Banished from his home, Wan survived for two years in the Spirit Wilds and learned to master fire.","But then, Wan split the spirits of light and dark, Raava and Vaatu, unwittingly plunging the world toward annihilation.","Will he be able to stop him?","Korra has regained her memory.","By connecting with the original Avatar, Korra learned that to stop Unalaq she must close the spirit portal before Harmonic Convergence, which is only weeks away!","Meanwhile, Varrick has made Bolin into a mover star and saved Asami's company.","Mako is the only one who suspects that Varrick is up to no good, but can he prove it?","Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the Northern portal and trapped Jinora in the Spirit World.","Back in Republic City, everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers.","Everybody, that is, except Mako, whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer.","And in the Southern Water Tribe, Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the Civil War, but Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight.","This is unbelievable!","Bolin is bending two full stacks of earth disks at once, which would normally be illegal, but then again, he's fighting three waterbenders, so all rules are out the window!","It's a knockout!","Bolin's a hero.","The mover's star stopped Varrick's kidnapping attempt on President Raiko, proving his brother's innocence.","Mako and Korra were reunited, but Korra has no memory of their break-up.","Meanwhile, Jinora's spirit is still trapped in the Spirit World, and Tonraq and his southern forces have been defeated.","Now it's up to Team Avatar to stop Unalaq before Harmonic Convergence.","After ten thousand years, Harmonic Convergence is here again, and the dark spirit Vaatu is free.","Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya have entered the portal to rescue Jinora's spirit.","Asami split from the group and took the injured Tonraq to safety.","So it's up to Korra, Mako, and Bolin to stop Unalaq before he fuses with Vaatu and becomes a Dark Avatar.","After fusing with Vaatu, Unalaq became a Dark Avatar and ripped Korra and Raava apart!","By destroying Raava, Unalaq and Vaatu transformed into the most powerful dark spirit that's ever lived.","Tenzin managed to free Jinora from the Fog of Lost Souls, but her spiritual quest isn't over yet.","Can anyone save the world from eternal darkness?","It's pandemonium in the streets!","Giant vines are destroying everything.","This is Shiro Shinobi, signing off!","The world has entered a new age.","Harmonic Convergence created an energy shift the likes of which has never been felt before.","And after two weeks, Republic City continues to recover from Korra's epic battle with UnaVaatu.","Vines have sprouted up all over, creating pockets of wilds the spirits have come to call home.","What other changes are in store for our city?","After a hundred and seventy years, there are new airbenders in the world and Bumi is one of them!","So too is the mysterious Zaheer, who escaped from his prison thanks to his new ability.","Now banished from Republic City, Korra made it her mission to find the new airbenders.","Will she and Tenzin be able to bring back the Air Nation?","The Air Nation has its first recruit.","Team Avatar's search for new airbenders in the Earth Kingdom led them to Kai, an orphan with a shady past.","Meanwhile, Lord Zuko is hot on the trail of three escaped criminals who pose a great threat to the Avatar.","Unaware of the danger to her, Korra continues her mission to find more airbenders.","Next stop, the walled city of Ba Sing Se.","Airbenders are mysteriously disappearing in Ba Sing Se, including Kai.","The Earth Queen denied any knowledge of the airbenders, but Korra refuse to give up her search.","Meanwhile, Mako and Bolin met their long lost relatives, who told them that Dai Li agents have been rounding up airbenders for the queen's army.","And at a prison in the north, Tonraq and Lord Zuko prepare for Zaheer's imminent attack.","Is there any place safe for the Avatar?","First, President Raiko banished her from Republic City.","Then the Earth Queen declared her an enemy of the Earth Kingdom after Korra rescued a group of airbenders in Ba Sing Se.","And Korra has learned that Zaheer and his fellow criminals are after her.","With Tenzin busy with bringing the new recruits to the Northern Air Temple, Korra's protection rests in Beifong's hands.","Lin Beifong has a sister.","After arriving in Zaofu, Korra met Opal, a new airbender whose mother is Lin's estranged half-sister.","Suyin and her daughter welcomed Lin with open arms, but she wanted nothing to do with them.","Meanwhile, Zaheer infiltrated Air Temple Island, looking for the Avatar.","After battling with Kya, he escaped and is now a wanted man in Republic City.","The Air Nation is reborn.","Thanks to the energy shift from Harmonic Convergence, certain people have acquired airbending abilities including Bumi, Kai, and Opal.","Although the new recruits show a lot of promise, they still have a lot to learn.","While Korra remains safe in Zaofu, Tenzin brings the new airbenders to the Northern Air Temple to begin their training.","Korra is now the first metalbending Avatar!","After training with Su Beifong, Korra quickly picked up the new skill, and Bolin is hoping to follow in her footsteps.","Meanwhile, the airbender Zaheer is closing in on Zaofu.","By his side are the lavabender Ghazan, the waterbender Ming-Hua, and the combustionbender P'Li.","But what do these mysterious criminals want with the Avatar?","Zaheer infiltrated Zaofu and attempted to kidnap the Avatar.","After a harrowing battle, she was saved and discovered a shocking truth: Aiwei, Su's trusted adviser, has been working with Zaheer.","This truth seer turned traitor managed to escape but Su tasks Team Avatar of tracking him down.","Now the hunted becomes the hunter as Korra searches for answers.","The Red Lotus is the world's newest threat.","After confronting Zaheer, Korra learned that he is part of a secret society whose mission is to take out all the nations' leaders and destroy world order.","But before Korra could warn anyone, she and Asami were apprehended by the Earth Queen's forces.","And the Red Lotus have Mako and Bolin.","Now both parties are headed toward Ba Sing Se.","Ba Sing Se has fallen.","After Zaheer and the Red Lotus toppled the Earth Queen, the city descended into chaos.","Meanwhile, Korra and Asami tried to escape their captors, but crashed in the desert.","After getting to safety, they met up with Lord Zuko, Tonraq, and Beifong.","Back in Ba Sing Se, Zaheer freed Mako and Bolin, giving them a vital message to deliver to Korra, but will the brothers find her in time?","The new Air Nation is in jeopardy.","In an effort to force Korra to surrender herself, Zaheer ambushed the Northern Air Temple.","Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya attempted to hold off the Red Lotus, but were injured in battle.","The airbenders were unable to escape and everyone was taken captive except Kai.","Now Korra and Team Avatar race to the temple hoping to mount a rescue.","The Red Lotus has captured the Avatar.","Korra gave herself up in exchange for the airbenders, but Zaheer double crossed her, while Ghazan trapped Team Avatar at the temple.","All seems lost until Bolin saved their lives by lavabending.","But he's not the only one with new skills.","Zaheer unlocked the ancient airbending ability of flight.","Will Team Avatar save the Air Nation and Korra before it's too late?","Welcome to Republic City, the place of hopes, dreams and Spirit Wilds!","This metropolis truly has something for everyone.","Visit Air Temple Island, the hub for all airbenders as they travel the world, helping others.","Or take a stroll through beautiful Avatar Korra Park, named in honor of \"You-Know-Who\"!","We've missed her these past three years and we can't wait to welcome her home.","Get well soon, Korra!","And of course, you'll want to see our most unique attractions: the Spirit Wilds.","Here, spirits and people live harmoniously together.","Like this old codger, and his new pals.","Yes siree, this town is truly on the up and up!","Come be a part of the action in Republic City!","The Avatar has gone missing!","Three years ago, Zaheer poisoned Korra, severely injuring her.","While her friends moved on with their lives, Korra remained in the South Pole.","Everyone thought she was still recuperating, but six months ago, Korra left home and hasn't been seen since.","Even Chief Tonraq was shocked to learn that his daughter's whereabouts are unknown.","What has become of the Avatar and when will she return?","So much has changed these past three years!","Mako is a bodyguard for the future Earth King, Prince Wu, while Bolin works for Kuvira, the Earth Kingdom's interim leader, who has brought stability to a nation plagued by chaos.","Meanwhile, after wandering the world trying to heal herself, a spirit led Korra to the swamp, where she met Toph Beifong.","Will this earthbending master be the key to Korra regaining her Avatar mojo?","After Korra failed to return to Republic City, everyone has been worried about her fate.","So Tenzin tasked Jinora, Ikki and Meelo with finding the Avatar.","Unbeknownst to the kids, Korra found refuge in the swamp with Toph, who discovered there was still metal poison in her body, but when Toph tried removing it, Korra resisted.","Will the airbender kids find the Avatar and help her return to action?","After three years, Kuvira has finally united the former Earth Kingdom states under her new Earth Empire banner!","But one holdout remains: Zaofu.","During that same time, Asami rebuilt the company her father created and helped redesign the city's infrastructure.","And, most recently, the airbender kids found the Avatar!","Korra rid herself of the residual poison in her body and is ready to return to action!","Kuvira threatens to take Zaofu by force!","After tensions flared between Su Beifong and her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Korra brokered a truce, but it was too late.","Su and her sons were already on their way to put an end to Kuvira.","Meanwhile, Bolin and Varrick learned of Kuvira's true tyrannical intent and deserted her army, but they were captured and betrayed by Zhu Li.","Now they're being held against their will!","Kuvira has defeated the Avatar and now controls the entire Earth Empire.","Luckily, the airbender kids and Opal rescued Korra and escaped Zaofu.","For the first time in three years, Korra will finally be back in Republic City!","Meanwhile, Varrick and Bolin escaped from Baatar Jr. and are on the run.","But will they make it back to the city in time to warn everyone about Kuvira's new spirit energy super weapon?","Korra is safely back in Republic City, but Bolin and Varrick are still on the lam!","Weeks ago, Korra removed the remaining poison from her body, but the memory of Zaheer's attack still torments her and, after being defeated by Kuvira, she questions if she will ever fully recover.","Meanwhile, Kuvira has been secretly harvesting spirit vines from the swamp, but how close is she to completing her spirit energy weapon?","After Kuvira harvested spirit vines from the swamp, the vines in Republic City reacted by abducting people.","Korra saved everyone, but all is not well.","Varrick and Bolin returned to warn everyone about Kuvira's spirit vine super weapon.","Now Raiko wants to mount a defense against the Earth Empire!","Meanwhile, Bolin, Opal, and Lin are on a mission to rescue Su Beifong and her family, who are being held captive by Kuvira!","Bolin, Opal, and Lin rescued the Beifongs and Zhu Li from Kuvira.","Now they are racing to Republic City to alert everyone about the Earth Empire's imminent attack.","Meanwhile, Korra and Team Avatar have been preparing for just such an event.","Prince Wu is leading an evacuation effort, while Asami and Varrick are creating flying mecha suits.","But with Kuvira planning to strike in only two weeks, will they be ready in time?","The Earth Empire has invaded the United Republic!","After Kuvira demonstrated the power of her spirit energy weapon, President Raiko surrendered the city, but the Avatar refused to give up without a fight.","Korra held Baatar Jr. hostage, hoping to force Kuvira to back down, but the plan failed and she fired on Team Avatar's hideout.","Can anything or anyone stop Kuvira and her mecha giant?","Republic City is a war zone!","While Prince Wu led the remaining citizens to safety, Team Avatar battled Kuvira's giant mech, but no amount of bending could bring it down!","In a last-ditch effort, Asami and her father outfitted the hummingbird suits with platinum cutters.","Hiroshi helped Team Avatar infiltrate the

me that.","You're not my brother!","You're a brother betrayer!","The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu!","Pabu loves me.","No!","I'm not going anywhere with you, you traitor!","Why?","''You're'' a bad idea!","Put me down!","Put me down!","Hey!","Watch it!","The way we're playing, we don't even deserve to be in the finals.","The sooner, the better.","Owww!","Ahh, it's messed up pretty bad.","But I think I'll be all right.","Are ''we'' gonna be all right?","Me too!","Girls ...","Yes!","She did it!","Ha, ha!","Shoulder!","Shoulder!","That, was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen.","Uh, if everyone's done with the little \"thank you\" party, need some medical attention over here.","Owww!","Gah!","Haven't you hurt me enough, woman?","No, no, oh- ooh!","That's the stuff!","Ahh, I'll be all right.","But we had fun together, didn't we?","Please, go on.","I enjoy praise.","Introducing your new champs, the fantastic Fire Ferrets!","That guy's got some nerve.","You can't!","Beat each other up!","In peace!","It's an inspiration to everyone!","Yes, exactly what she said!","Yes!","All right!","Now I know there's a big crowd but don't be nervous.","You're gonna do great, I believe in you.","You're on, Pabu.","Yes!","Nailed it!","He's so talented!","Pfft, they got nothing on us, buddy.","Anybody can howl.","Hm, whatever.","That's the stuff.","You are my herooo-ah!","Pabu!","Listen up, buddy.","I'm not!","I'm trying to save us!","See?","Pabu's not just a one trick poodle pony.","It's okay, Pabu.","Just a little explosion.","Keep chewing, you're almost through it!","Yes!","Great job, buddy!","Me too!","Yeah.","We had some good memories here, didn't we?","Earthbending bomb!","Welcome to paradise!","''This'' is the greatest place in the world!","Watch this, watch this.","Fetch me my towel, good sir.","Master Bolin!","Ha, I love this guy.","Now pat me dry.","Don't forget Master Pabu.","Emergency, emergency coming through, beep beep!","Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?","What was that?","Yeah, just stay put until the chief comes back.","That's sounds very familiar doesn't it, why?","Because you said it.","Oh no.","Hello, Mr. Sato.","Wow!","What a really swell, scary factory you have here under your giant mansion.","I have a couple of questions.","Is this an all vegetarian island?","Is that where you train airbending?","Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes?","Do we each get our own sky bison?","And final question, how many trees are on this island?","I'm a boy!","Korraaa!","And he wasn't alone.","He had his friends to help him.","Look, the arena might be shut down but we're still a team.","The ''new'' Team Avatar!","Get ready, Republic City.","You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar.","Naga away!","Chi blockers!","I call front!","We'll be all right.","Cover your ears!","I can't go with you listening.","Ahh!","A little privacy, please!","Thanks for catching that.","Then where do we start?","Yeah!","Yeah, that makes sense!","When those chi blockers had me in their truck, it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!","Hmm.","This way kinda ... smells familiar.","Yeah, we all are!","W-What?","No!","That's, just gossip, where'd you hear that?","Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now.","Heh ...","Nothing!","I mean, there was this one time during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but- Believe me, I was upset too, but, I'm over it.","I don't think it meant anything.","Let's go, people!","Try to chi block that, fools!","Ughh!","Man!","I had this awful dream that Korra was taken by this evil bloodbender.","So weird.","Are you serious?","Where is he?","Is he here right now?","All things considered you did a great job!","But how are we going to pay for all these parking tickets?","Car!","Oh, we're good.","Mustache guy!","You are a wise and noble hobo.","''Mmmm.''","This is the best-tasting street gruel I've ever had.","Seriously!","Whoops!","Where does Hiroshi find the time to keep inventing new evil machines?!","No matter what our plan is, he always has a better one.","I like this man's confidence!","So, how are we not out of the fight?","Love you back, big bro.","Korra, Amon is a nasty dude.","Be careful.","Aye aye, captain!","Ooh, general, general.","All right, you guys wait here until we get back, okay?","Uh-uh, stay.","That is a negative, Sir.","Naga!","Over here!","Who needs a metalbender?","We got Naga!","Yeah!","Ahh!","No, Naga!","Whoa!","Thanks Naga.","Mr. Sato, you are a horrible father!","Hey, at least you unlocked your airbending!","Right, right, I'll just stand over here quietly, in silence.","Where's Mako when I need him?","Wow!","Look at all these people that came out to greet us.","Whoa!","Who are the lovely ladies?","What?","Oh, it's so good.","You looked like you were just sitting on a pillow.","Uh ... no?","Yeah.","Is that how business usually goes?","Wish me luck.","I'm making my move!","Whee!","Hey, I'm Bolin.","I'm a friend of Korra's!","You're, uh, Eska right?","Wow, I'm just, I am loving these robes.","So, you are from the north right?","Cool, that's, like you know, that's my favorite direction.","You mean like a boyfriend, or like a slave ...?","Uh, What's going on?","Got it!","Don't got it!","Guys!","Hey, wait for me!","Check it out, I'm traveling in style!","Okay, uh, sorry, still getting used to that throttle.","Sure does.","But, uh ... who's gonna drive?","Go away, Mako.","What are those?","Can we not talk about dark spirits, please?","Thank you.","Whoa, so ''you'' were supposed to be chief, then ''he'' became chief.","No wonder you guys don't like each other.","Ow!","What?","Isn't that what happened?","Is that what I think it is?","Oh man, I really don't like this.","Oh, it's in the engine!","Aaaahhhhh!","Aaaahhhhh!","I can't stop it!","I'm a raft!","Uhhh, can someone please deflate me?","Thank you.","Yeah!","If she goes, we go, too!","It's beautiful.","Hey, Korra, you're back.","Hey, Korra's back!","Yes, dear.","So-so funny.","You know, I'll be ''really'' sad when you have to leave.","It's been ''really'' great getting to know you.","''Really.''","Mako!","I'm so happy to see you!","No!","No, I'm not all right.","I can't take anymore.","Listen, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska!","Don't make me.","Oh, please, please don't make me.","Break up with her?","You can do that?","How?","Oh, no, no, I don't think she'd like that.","Thanks, Mako.","Whew.","I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts.","Ha, Korra better watch out.","Oooh, no, it's just a-, uh, you kn-, uh, never mind.","Isn't this fun, huh?","We never get to spend enough time together, just the ... five of us.","So fun.","You guys gotta save me.","I tried!","But anytime I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin piranhas!","Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off.","Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands.","No, no, not to me it wasn't.","I'm very bad at reading people.","You should know that by now.","Oh, man.","Oh!","Do something, Avatar!","Would you relax?","This place is great.","And the best part about it, Eska doesn't know I'm here.","Ee-yah.","I wasn't hiding.","Hey, hey-hey, hey.","Yeah, he's a cop.","Yes, yes, my sweet koala otter.","I tried to break up with her, but ''Mako'' gave me terrible advice.","Thank you, Mako.","Varrick?","Wow!","What's the money for?","I think I catch your drift, Varrick-bear.","We're good to go.","I gave all the money to some guys over there.","I told them to \"take care of it\", and then I winked.","Pretty sure they got the message.","Man!","I should have paid him!","Objection!","Your honor, if I may?","May I ... declare a mistrial?","Hey there, Eska, I was wondering if we could talk.","Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you.","You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark.","But I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading.","Oh!","Oh, yes!","I'm so glad you understand!","Oh, no, I can't - This is really tight.","No, no, the honesty thing worked out great.","So great she decided we should get married!","I guess ''Eska'' didn't get the memo.","Uh, you fellas seen a traveling circus come through here?","Where's your dad?","I really need to thank you, Korra.","Exactly!","Now Eska and I are officially broken up.","''That'' would be my darling Eska.","Quick question: is this thing fast enough to get away from my crazy waterbending ex-girlfriend?","So, um, what should I be doing?","Sure, I live here.","Y- no?","Wow.","Usually, when I see flashing lights like this, it's because I got hit in the head with a rock.","Well, I took a trip South for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war ...","But there's nowhere I'd rather be than pro-bending night in Republic City!","Am I right, people?","Republic City!","The trick is, whenever I get confused, I just say \"Republic City\" or \"fans\", and then everyone cheers.","Sorry I ever doubted you.","Don't freak out.","It's not real.","Ahhh!","Sorry.","I keep doing that.","I'm Nuktuk!","What do you think?","Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today.","That guy is a genius.","He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing.","And he's gonna put me in the movers as this hero, Nuktuk!","He's a man of action, but he's got a heart of gold.","He was born in the tundra.","Oh.","Oh, sorry.","Uh, sure.","What is it?","Glad I could help.","Nuktuk saves the day again!","Wouldn't I be ''cold'' wearing this outfit in the snow?","Ohhh.","Hey, Ginger.","Where are you going?","And Mako.","What?","There's no way Mako would have told.","Right?","I- is this a trick question?","Uh ... not that I can recall.","Right ... Wow.","We got some major chemistry on-screen.","Am I right?","What's wrong?","Are you mad because I left you in the clutches of the evil Unalaq?","I'm gonna save you in the next episode.","Ginger, let's work through this.","Hey, Mako, what do you think?","I did a little redecorating.","It turns out that one of the perks of being a star, you get lots of cash.","It's also a hat rack.","That's because we never ''had'' a hat rack.","And now we do.","Mako, you seem stressed.","I think ''you'' need to take a little dipity dip.","You need my help?","I don't know.","I'm kinda busy.","I'm maintaining my instrument.","As an actor, my ''body'' is my instrument.","You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life.","I don't know, Mako.","Figure it out.","Remember?","That's what you said to me.","Hurts, doesn't it?","Ow!","My instrument!","Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment.","It just felts so right.","So ... that kiss.","I liked it.","And it seemed like you liked it too.","Okay, okay, I'm sorry.","I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now.","It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not.","But Nuktuk ''is'' Bolin.","I'm a hero.","Yes?","Oh, hello, Mako.","Didn't notice you there.","Hmm.","Can't say that I've seen him.","But I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene.","There's gonna be some crazy \"pyrotechnics\".","That's mover speak for explosions.","Or sometimes we just call them explosions.","Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene.","Hello?","Anyone?","Nuktuk's still up here, all alone.","Asami!","Hey, what are you doing here?","Right now?","Nope.","We're uh ... we're at lunch.","Up here.","Ahh!","Ow, aww.","Oh, I got to stop doing my own ''stunts''.","What?","No.","See, this is why I had to move out.","Nope.","It was time for this eagle hawk to spread his wings and fly.","Korra just left a week ago!","Hey, Mako.","I'm on my way to the big finale for \"Nuktuk: Hero of the South.\"","Yeah, everyone's gonna be there except for, you know, you ... because you're in jail and stuff.","Hey, I brought you something.","I thought this would brighten up your new place.","Read the inscription.","No, I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement.","I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you.","We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal.","Of course ''I'' know that, but you do kinda look like one, cause you're in a jail and that's where criminals live.","Ah, I see what you're doing.","You're going for the insanity defense.","Smart.","That's not what Shiro said!","I just wish Mako was here to see it.","Of course I know.","Juji's fine.","He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth.","Oops.","Spoiler.","Sorry.","I guess I just miss my friends.","Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around.","Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing ... business-lady stuff.","Team Avatar's fallen apart.","You go ahead.","I need another another minute.","That's weird.","I don't think so.","Mister President, get back, I'm here to help.","Looks like there's no where to go.","Tell me who sent you!","Boyfriend?","Wait, stop.","I thought you said we ''weren't'' a couple.","Yeah!","Oh, you meant right now.","Unalaq is going to destroy the world?","He really does have a doomsday device?","Sir, Nuktuk needs your help.","I know you love helping people.","Never should have saved that guy.","Yeah, me too.","I saved the president, in real life!","You were right about Varrick.","He tried to kidnap Raiko!","But it didn't work, because of you, and because of me.","Let's just say we both did good.","Beifong says you're free to go.","Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako.","Oh yeah, did I forget to tell you?","Korra's back.","I think I know just the man to talk to.","Well we're gonna end it.","Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?","You named your battleship after your assistant?","All right!","Team Avatar is back in business.","Haha!","It's a Varrick ship, you never know what you're gonna find.","There's a whole level filled with fun-house mirrors.","Of course, there's also the catgator deck.","I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting.","So, have you told Korra yet about how you guys broke up, and you kinda started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?","Oh Mako, you know a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech: you just have to do it fast and get it over with.","Are we almost there?","A suicide mission ...","I'm an earthbender, strapped to the wing of a plane, hundreds of feet in the air, so, no?","I think they were expecting it!","Asami!","I wish Varrick was filming this!","We could call it \"Nuktuk: Sky Warrior\"!","Wait a second.","Worst-case scenario: so we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals and let's just say ''something'' happens to you.","Are we going to be trapped in there for eternity?","We're on it.","I don't know if we can win this fight.","Unalaq?","Are you out there?","He must've gone home?","I'm sorry, I can't help it.","It's just so sad that I'll never be with you again.","Eska, I've always loved you.","And I always wanted to be with you.","But now that the world is ending, I'm never gonna get that chance.","No, I was scared.","I was scared of my true feelings for you.","Gah, I should have never left you.","I'm sorry.","And I'm sorry that we'll never have the chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a ''big'' fire of love flames.","Yeah right, huh.","That was acting.","He's got the Light Spirit!","No.","I am too young to live through ten thousand years of darkness.","Korra, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?","Eska!","I love you!","Let's face the end of the world together!","And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow!","I just wished Varrick was here to film it!","It would be the greatest mover ever.","After the Nuktuk chronicles of course.","So, I was thinking.","I'm not really a fan of a long-distance relationship thing, so how about you move to Republic City with me.","Okay.","Desna can come too.","But you said- Yeah.","I guess I did too.","You want a hug?","Bumi says he airbended earlier, but he can't now.","Oh, and I guess he's not very good at knitting either.","I gotta say, I ''love'' being a part of this family.","You got the grumpy dad, the wacky uncle, the put-upon mom, ''crazy'' kids.","Well, that's just great.","Oh, you mean the brooding teenager?","He's staying in the police station.","I told him Tenzin invited us to stay here since our apartment is a vine habitat now, but, he said he had to focus on work.","Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.","I think that could've gone better.","Mako called!","The cops found a new airbender guy, but when they tried to bring him in, he ran away and climbed to the top of Kyoshi Bridge and won't come down.","Ooh sorry, did I interrupt an Avatar wisdom session?","Oh okay.","Is that a good thing?","Mako, wait a sec.","A life?","You sleep under your desk.","And what's a more important job than helping the Avatar rebuild an entire civilization?","Well, drift back, we need you!","C'mon Mako, we're going to Ba Sing Se, where Dad grew up.","What if I meet our grandma for the very first time, and she asks me \"Where's your sweet brother?\"","and I have to say \"I'm sorry, Grandma, he had some really important police paperwork to file\" and she starts to cry those grandma tears, and is like \"Mako!","Why?","Why?","I can't go on, I ca--\" and then she dies.","No worries!","I love pie.","And so does Pabu.","Or we could have thrown him in a potato sack and forced him into the ship.","So nice to meet you!","Good luck with your son!","Yeah, razzle-dazzle!","We could put on some sort of airbending street performance!","Yes!","That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear!","Come one, come all to witness The Amazing Airbenders!","The airbending show that will leave you breathless ... with wind!","First up, the tattooed master himself, you know him as the son of Avatar Aang, he shaves every hair on his head, every single day!","It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose, Tenzin!","Now, now, ladies and gentleman, ladies and gentleman, please be quiet.","I have some serious news.","We've heard that an escaped firebending convict has been spotted near here.","Now, I don't want to panic anyone, but if you see a firebender with a red scarf- Oh no!","Who will help us?","With the power of airbending, even this beast can float!","Like a feather.","Look what can be done in only a few short weeks of practice!","No no, don't worry folks.","She might be young, but she is in full control!","Ladies and gentlemen, if you, or anyone you know is an airbender, please, send them our way!","Master Tenzin and Avatar Korra would love to teach them all they know!","Get outta town!","This is going to be so great!","You going to love it, er ... ah ... real quick, what's your name?","You're an orphan?","Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore, right guys?","Tell him.","When you board this airship, you're going to leave your old life behind and start a new path.","That's big brother advice.","Just think of me as your big brother.","Are, are you taking him back to the orphanage?","Welcome to the family, little bro.","This is it, Mako!","We made it!","This is where Dad grew up!","Come here!","Look, look!","Yeah, I can smell it from here.","No wonder Dad left.","Hello, Middle Ring!","Aah, it's got that Upper Ring smell.","Well, I can just stash Pabu in my shirt, these two are going to be a little tougher.","Ooh, very swanky.","But he's my new little brother.","He's probably lost, and scared.","Kai, did you go fishing?","You under the bridge?","Kai, it's us.","Mako and Bolin, your new family.","Excuse me, coming through Pardon me.","Carry on.","Yeah ... just a lovable little scamp, isn't he?","We can pay, hold on.","Where's my money?","No, Kai wouldn't-- Aww, man.","The bad news is we're stuck here.","The good news is we can go the bathroom wherever we want.","Ohh man, aww I slipped a disc sleeping here.","It's been awhile since we spent the night in a trash pile.","It's about how I remembered.","Fwoo, I'm getting really hungry.","Haah, we might have to hustle up a little breakfast with the old, fruit stand scam.","Come on.","You remember how it goes, I push you into the stand, you scream.","I pretend to faint.","I'm confused.","Are we stealing the fruit or not?","Yeah, I mean I'm famous so I get that, but how do you know his name?","Yeah, they're not really comedies, but uh ... Oh, Mako and I grew up on the streets.","We were homeless, then we were kinda in a gang, then we lived in a gym ...","Wait, you mean you don't know?","This is so great!","We never had a family before.","Now we've got one, two, five ... eleven ... ... a big family!","Yeah!","Look, Mako!","Dad's wearing your scarf!","What?","What happened?","I hope Kai is okay.","Awesome!","Tu, you're the best cousin that I can have.","And my other cousins as well.","Yeah.","Yeah, you're all the best.","I love you too, Grandma.","And Chow, and Tu, and Meng-Meng, and Chow Jr., there is Big Tee and Little Tee, and Medium Yu, and ... and ... and what was your name again?","We chased Kai.","Train.","Slipped away.","Lower Ring.","Slept in trash pile.","Met our family.","Grandma tears.","Mako scarf.","Earth Queen.","Lying.","Quick!","Pabu.","Shirt.","I know.","Sorry.","Kinda sweaty.","I'm on it!","What?","Hey, I'm not sweaty this time!","Whoa!","Tenzin's not gonna be happy about this!","How can I not?","This is too juicy!","We can't stay mad at you.","We need help!","Everybody, hang on.","Wow!","Wow!","Wow!","An entire city made of metal!","Wohoho, you should feel right at home, Beifong.","Yeah!","Does Toph live here?","Are we going to get to meet her?","Oh ... Wow, that's a really nice ... banana?","Yes, very, very lifelike.","Oh, yeah, no, uh, I can, I can totally see that.","I can, oh, let me stand here.","Yes, I can see that now.","Yes.","Thank you.","Banana.","I mean, that's a banana right?","Opal.","That's a beautiful name.","I'm Bolin.","Mmmm.","I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical when he said \"pea tendrils\", but this is delicious.","Oh.","I had plenty when Mako and I were living in the streets.","I mean, you'd be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be.","No, no, it's okay, that's all in the past.","Things are great now.","I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, became ''a mover star'', and now, I'm helping the Avatar rebuild a whole nation.","Varrick!","Yeah, I know.","She's sweet and pretty and super nice.","Too bad she's not my type.","You know, that really hurts a little bit.","Right ... here.","Maybe you're right, bro.","Maybe Opal is Bolin material.","Thanks.","Yeah!","Hey, lady.","Wow, you really blowin' me away with your ''airbending''.","Ahhh, woo-woosh, psst.","Why are ''you'' acting weird?","Look, I'm sorry.","I just get really self-conscious when I know when a girl likes me, and I-I end up looking stupid.","Oh no.","But I though ... Mako said- Huh.","Be myself.","Yeah, I guess I can give that a shot.","No!","Oh, hey ladies.","Just uh ...","I was just looking for Pabu.","Pabu!","Oh, look there you are!","You know, I thought something was chewing on my ear.","Probably need to get a shot.","Pabu has sort of a ... a venom.","Anyways, so what are you guys doing?","You metalbending over here or something?","Nah, it's okay.","I mean, only like one earthbender in a hundred can metalbend.","Well, maybe I'll just ...","I'll just stay and watch.","Wow, you picked that up really, really quick.","Guess you're that one in a hundred.","Opal!","Oh, wow, you ... really know how to sneak up on someone.","Oh nothing, you know, just ... just thinking about my body and mustaches that I might have in the future.","Sorry.","I wasn't really thinking about all my mustaches.","I'm just frustrated.","I've been trying to metalbend and I can't figure it out.","Don't tell anyone, okay?","Because it's embarrassing.","This isn't the first time I've tried, and I've been wanting to metalbend ever since I heard about Toph.","Your grandmother is my biggest hero!","You know what?","Maybe I am scared.","But what about you?","I know that you want to go to the Northern Air Temple to train with Tenzin, but you haven't done it, because you're afraid too!","Look at us!","Talking about our feelings, supporting each other.","So, umm, I've been thinking, and I'd like to try to learn metalbending.","I mean, I'm sure you have a waiting list or something of a couple years so.","I think Lin is mad about something.","You don't have any siblings, fighting is all part of the healing process.","No, no, no, no, no, no!","Not me!","You're the Avatar, why can't you do it?","She ''is'' wonderful, and pretty, and so smart, and she smells like flowers ...","Sorry.","Bolin, out.","Hang on, I think I got it.","Let me just try this.","Nope, okay maybe- Mako, metalbending is extremely difficult.","No one gets it right away, if they can get it at all!","It's not normal!","Oh sure.","She's the Avatar.","Oh, now I have to say bye to Opal?","This is the worst day ever!","Every time I eat raw kale, I'm going to think of you.","This stinks!","We were just starting to get to know each other, and now you're off to the Northern Air Temple.","Yeah, but that's ... in the future.","Ugh, I hate the future!","Umm, no.","Kale, kale, kale ... Opal ... What?","What's going on?","Pabu, sleep!","Huh?","What?","Oh, Pabu.","It's not play time right now.","Okay, we are seriously going to have to have a talk- What the heck?!","They've got Korra.","They've got Korra!","No way!","That guy is lavabending!","That's awesome ... ly not good for us.","I can?","I do?","All right.","Bolin time.","Bolin time!","I can't get a clean shot!","What?","Hey, Varrick.","What are you doing here?","But for who?","He's not home.","Or he's hiding in there.","Or he's invisible.","Probably just not home.","Hmm, it's like a desert on a jar.","Could be a storage cellar.","We do.","We do.","We actually knocked on your front door and we thought we heard you say, 'Come in, I'm in the bathroom!'","I don't even know why I'm saying that.","You know I'm lying, and you don't even sound like that.","But you said - Ohh look, they have a mover poster of me.","Must be big Nuktuk fans, yeah, I should go out and say hello ...","Yes!","I love it when you talk like a cop.","Ooh, Mako, Mako, Mako!","We should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover!","That way, no one will recognize us.","Haha, police work is so exciting!","All right, now we need our undercover identities!","I'm an ex-United Forces operative named Ting-Ting.","War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is.","Tragically, she was taken from me by my archenemy Dr. Razor and - But I haven't even told your backstory.","Uh!","You're good at this.","And he's got this weird piercing that goes from his nose to his ear.","Freaks me out.","Well, aren't you a cute little spir- Ow!","Hey!","I think there might be a couple bounty hunters over there who recognize me!","We could, or ... we could follow Aiwei instead.","Look!","Ting-Ting always finds his man.","Uh, I'd be happy to.","Always love meeting my fans.","Uh, it's ... cute.","I'd just like to say, for the record, this room is definitely not perfect.","Naga!","I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting.","This isn't.","At all!","Ooh, I wonder if there's any snacks in here.","Hey, look!","A Pai Sho board!","Mako, you want to play?","Oh, well, ugh, no offense but I learned street Pai Sho from Shady Shin, and I'm pretty good.","So, wouldn't really be a fair game.","Well, looks we've got ourselves a Pai-Shodown.","Ladies first.","Uh, I don't mean to rush you, but let's speed things up a bit.","No, it's not.","This is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, game of chance!","Don't think.","Just go.","Oh really?","I think Mr. Rulebook might disagree with you.","The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years.","It is a game of both strategy and chance.","Wait, how can it be both?","That's no help at all.","Korra, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules.","That's cool.","Whenever you get to it.","That's just like Pai Sho!","In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to ''know'' your opponent.","What?","Ugh.","All right, you know what that was just a fluke.","Best two out of three.","Oh, come on!","Best four out of seven.","Eight out of fifteen.","Seventeen out of thirty-three?","Ha, ha!","Looks like you're on the ropes this time.","No, Pabu?","Why?","That's a weird way to nap.","Korra, come on!","Wake up!","I can't beat this guy!","It's like I'm giving him ammo!","Want to trade?","So you guys were like locked up for fifteen years, ''huh''?","It must've been like crazy boring.","I mean, what did you do with all that time?","Did you sing songs, work on crafts?","Ooh okay, that sounds like fun.","Let me try that on you guys.","''You'' were raised by an older sister, your mustache grew in when you were ten and I'm sensing - just sensing - an unspoken attraction between you two.","Sorry!","Four years?","No.","I appreciate that, Mako, and fellow ... prisoner man.","But I've been trying and trying and trying and I've never been able to do it.","Not even a little.","You're right.","Okay, here I go.","Metalbending.","I can't metalbend.","You said before \"was my time\".","Did you see that?","I did it!","I mean, not for us, but I metalbent all the other cells open!","Should we do something?","Right.","Okay, find Korra, deliver message.","Yeah, this should be easy.","We just got to get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast expansive wasteland that goes on for thousands, and thousands, of miles.","This isn't gonna be easy.","Some folks just do not have respect for other people's property.","Now let's steal this airship!","Technically speaking, no.","But, c'mon, how hard could it be?","I don't see any up button.","I see levers and switches, oh, there it is.","Mako, our family's down there.","Oh, you think just because you dated Asami, you know how to fly this better than me?","I came to get you guys out.","This whole block is about to go up in flames.","Come on, Mako and I have an airship on the roof.","Grandma, we don't have time for tea.","Grandma, there's one thing Mako and I've learned from all our years on the street.","It doesn't matter where you go.","If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home.","Fine!","You leave me no choice.","We're rolling out!","I don't know.","But there's some tracks.","See, I told you.","Landing is hard.","Okay, guys.","We think Korra found her way back here.","Now let's split off into teams and scour the town.","Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu, now just give me a second while I- wait, Pabu?","Pabu!","I'm never gonna let you go again!","Asami!","Korra!","Oh my gosh, it's Lord Zuko!","I can't believe it.","Because he wanted us to find you and deliver a message.","I guess, in the meantime, Mako and I will stay here and try to get through to the temple.","I told you, it's Bolin!","No!","I'm not looking for Bolin, I ''am'' Bolin!","Gah, look, I need you to find your dad.","No, a whole herd?","Really?","Wait, I've got it.","I'll disguise myself as a lost hiker, and once I'm in the temple, I'll distract the Red Lotus with my bird calls.","That's when you all strike.","Well I haven't noticed you offering any suggestions.","I'm just worried about Opal, and Pabu's not here to comfort me.","I hope he and Naga are doing okay back in Zaofu.","Oh, man.","Not gonna happen.","The exit's blocked.","On it!","Is it just me, or is it uh, getting really warm in here?","Oh, this is not good.","Let's move it, people!","We can't outrun it!","This way.","I know.","I just found out.","You're right.","Being moments from death was a pretty good motivator too.","Of course, we would have never made it back with Kai.","Are you sure?","Me too.","Look out!","What are you smiling about?","Well, a lot has changed since then.","Give up, Ghazan!","You can't win.","Mako, hang on!","See what I did there?","I put a sock in him, literally.","I do what I do.","We just got some good news.","Two more Earth Kingdom states have agreed to join us.","Kai!","''Wow'', you are a lot heavier than you used to be.","You're really growing up.","Hey, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent and professional.","Opal, I can't believe you're here too!","I missed you so much.","Isn't that great, sweetie?","What happened?","I guess ...","I got to go.","I'm not!","I wanna help, but if the Governor wants us gone, there's ... there's nothing I can do.","I'm sorry.","Hey ... Opal, please.","Now don't take this the wrong way, but, I can't wait for you to leave!","Don't forget to write!","You will be most pleased to learn that I found gainful employment with Sir Varrick and the Lady Kuvira.","I set off on the morrow with some trepidation, but I am eager to offer any aid I can in stabilizing the Earth Kingdom!","Hello Republic Cit-ay!","Bolin ... is back!","And ... Eska is also here.","Oh no no, that's Kuvira, she's kind of my boss.","I know, right?","I see myself in the mirror sometimes and I think I'm in trouble before I realize: it's only me.","So, have you seen Korra yet?","Were you surprised?","Because I was ''really'' surprised.","Won't this turn all the world leaders against us?","Yeah, well, I just have some misgivings about how you kind of ambushed Tenzin and the other leaders.","I do, but ...","I'm just not sure about this whole \"Empire\" thing.","It seems pretty aggressive.","And what was that part about the crushing?","I'll stand by you.","Interesting ceremony, huh?","You don't understand.","Kuvira is helping out all the poor people of the Earth Empire.","People like our family.","This is for the best.","Okay, why don't you come with me, and you'll see for yourself?","We've done a lot of good, and Varrick is working on some new innovations.","We're making ''history''.","''That'' was just some tough rhetoric to let the people know that we mean business.","I mean, Kuvira is basically just like Korra.","She might seem hard to deal with, but just because she's so passionate and believes in what she's doing.","Oh, okay, you think your new best friend in there would be a better leader than Kuvira?","Still what?","Come on, Mako!","I'm making a difference out there, what are you doing, huh?","You're just some glorified butler for some snotty rich bozo!","'''Fine'''!","I'm going to go back to my awesome train, where we bring ''freedom'' where ever we go!","Enjoy licking the king's boots in your ''junior suite!''","Am ...","I in trouble?","I can do that!","By the time I'm finished telling her all the great things we've done, she'll be begging to join!","Aren't all these troops gonna send the wrong message?","Opal!","You're here, too!","''Sides?''","There shouldn't be sides!","I know, why don't we all stand in a circle, huh?","Maybe hold hands?","Okay, guys, obviously, there's a lot of personal, painful history here, so what do you say we just all forget about that stuff, huh?","I mean, that's the past!","Right Wing?","Right Wei?","You guys know what I'm talkin' 'bout, right?","High five!","All right.","No, that's cool.","You know what I think we need to do?","Focus on the future!","And the future is bright, let me tell you!","I've seen it!","Yeah!","Saw it last month!","We went to this town that had ''nothing.''","Most of the people there had never seen a Satomobile before.","Now, they have ''two'' Satomobiles, running water, and a magnet train that goes right through their town!","I mean, how awesome is ''that''?","You're wrong, Opal!","Now, I don't know what you think you've seen, but I am giving you the one-hundred-percent Bolin guarantee that we're making the Earth Empire a better place to live!","You were just bluffing, right?","I mean, you're not really gonna attack Zaofu ... are you?","''Other'' ... ways?","How many ... times have we used these \"other ways\" in the past?","So, uh ... what ''does'' happen to all those towns and villages after we leave?","I just realized I'd never really ... gone back and ... checked on them.","Maybe ...","I'm not really an \"inner circle\" kind of guy.","Or--or maybe, we don't take over Zaofu!","Maybe we can just--let them be on their own, and then, \"Yay!","The Empire's united!","Congratulations to us!\"","I ... thought that's where we sent people to learn new trade skills.","No--no, I'm totally on your side, completely, one-hundred-percent loyal.","Varrick?","Varrick?!","Well, there's something important I gotta tell you, too!","How'd you find out?","She threatened me, too!","And she's threatening Zaofu and it turns out, she's been threatening villages this whole time!","We gotta get outta here.","Okay, I say we go up and around the mountains-- --and sneak into Zaofu from the rear.","What?","No, nonono, we gotta help ''here''.","Well, that's helping, but it's a completely different type of helping.","''Hmm''.","Let me think about this.","Don't ... torture us.","What's goin' on?","Wait, what?","I need my hands!","Uh, hold on!","Can we have breakfast first?","While we still have hands?","What thing?","I'm not Zhu Li, okay?","Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here, also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands ''blown off!''","Clean energy!","Sounds ''great''!","Who doesn't like that stuff?","Let's do ''that'' instead!","Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them, you know this isn't right.","What?!","What bomb?","Nononono!","I'm not ready to go down with the ship, ''or the train''!","That's everyone, our half of the train is clear.","Man, that was great!","I gotta admit, you had me going there for a while, I really thought you were gonna blow us up!","Now, how do we turn this thing off?","What are you talking about, \"a good run\"?","I'm still running!","I like running!","I want you to know, ''I hate you''.","I can't ''believe'' Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did.","How about you use your own legs for a while?","Well, Zhu Li's not here, okay?","No way mister!","You're not getting off that easily.","You're responsible for that weapon Kuvira is trying to make.","Which, may I remind you, could hurt a lot of people.","Okay, look.","Kuvira fooled us both into doing her dirty work and I'm not happy about it either.","''But'', you know how we're gonna make it up to the world?","By getting back to Republic City and warning everyone what she's up to!","So, I want you to take my hand and march with me out of this forest!","Oh, great, my feet could use a break.","Are you ''kidding'' me?!","I wish Pabu were here.","He could just chew us out of this.","Hello fellow travelers!","I don't suppose you can help us out of this net?","Were, not anymore!","Please, just, let us out!","So how did a bunch of water and firebenders end up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps?","Purging?!","No, I swear!","And the inner circle thing lasted like, less than a day!","Look, I'm sorry for what happened to all of you, but as I've been trying to explain, we don't work for Kuvira anymore.","All right, where is this checkpoint?","Follow my lead.","You sure can.","We captured these escaped prisoners.","We need to get them to a secure facility.","Camp fourteen.","You think we don't know where Camp fourteen is?","''Kuvira'' wants them transferred.","Varrick, wait, we can't leave them!","Yeah.","I kind of did.","Let's go!","I know it might not mean much coming from a guy wearing this uniform, but I'd like to apologize for what Kuvira's put you through.","Guess this is where we part ways.","Come on, I want you to meet my brother, Mako.","Ooh!","Giant pillow!","Oh, come on!","I wasn't singing, ''you'' were not levitating, and Asami is just a friend, thank you very much.","If you want to tell my true story, you should start from when I met Korra.","She came to the bending arena, one fateful night ... Name's Bolin, by the way.","There wasn't any singing!","Wait!","Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu.","How would that even happen?","Oooh, ''now'' the story's getting interesting.","''Opal'', so smart and caring, so pretty to smell, and she'll probably never talk to me again because I'm so stupid!","''Stupid''!","So, so, so stupid.","Okay, that part seems a little unbelievable.","Wait!","You ''like'' that?","It didn't make any sense!","What about Zombie Amon?","What happened to him, ''huh''?","And-and-and-and ''stars'' are magic fairy dust?","Are you guys crazy?","Are you crazy?","Guys!","Oh, perfect!","You're all here.","Listen to me.","Kuvira's making this thing that goes I don't know how it works, but it has this I know, I know.","I didn't listen to you, and I sided with Kuvira, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom, and topple your home, and get your mom captured, and your brothers, and your dad ... Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that.","But I'm gonna make it up to you.","Thanks, guys.","Mako, I'm ''so'' sorry about the way we left things.","I'm such an idiot.","You tried to warn me about Kuvira and I ran off anyway, like an idiot.","You were right and I'm ''just'' an ''idiot''.","I hope ... that ...","I'll be able to earn your trust again.","Aww, I love you guys.","And I really wanna hug again.","Opal, you made it!","A picnic, just for the two of us!","Well, the three of us.","Sorry, Pabs.","Where are you going?","All right, listen.","Before you go, I just want to tell you that I understand how you feel.","I know there is nothing I could do or no big gesture that could make up for all my mistakes, ''but'' that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying to win you back because ...","I love you.","What is it?","Yes, I'll do anything!","Where to?","All right, let's do this!","Saving the Beifongs and saving our love, because I vow to repair the rift that has grown betwixt us and make us whole again!","Yes, ma'am.","Oh, man!","Ohh, I can't.","This can't be happening!","No ... well, now, maybe.","You're my hero!","My name is Bolin.","I'm dating your granddaughter, I mean, kind of.","I may have screwed that up, but that's why I'm here and you're my hero!","Oh, I said that.","Can I have a hug too?","Sure, okay, makes sense.","There's a factory and reeducation facility not too far away.","\"Used to\"!","Please tell me this attitude isn't hereditary.","So how long as it been since you two have seen each other?","Okay, there's the factory.","Whoa, that's one big ... thing.","Someone's coming.","Hide!","Or at least destroy the cannon.","If she takes that to Republic City, it could obliterate everything.","Hmm.","Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then.","That's our best chance to sneak in and free Su without being spotted.","Thanks.","I kind of have a headache now.","So let me ask you about metalbending.","Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it.","I did learn how to lavabend.","I can't believe ... you think I'm talented?","That means so much to me coming from my hero.","So here's something I've always been curious about: Who's Lin's dad?","And ... okay.","I got you!","We got 'em.","We're coming out.","What?","No, I have to go save her.","We've been through too much together.","I can't leave her.","Toph, you said Zhu Li was lying about fixing the cannon.","She must have been trying to stop it.","No, Zhu Li doesn't make mistakes.","You guys leave.","If we make it out, we'll make it to the city somehow.","You know, I never had any family except for my brother until a few years ago, and reuniting with them made me realize how special it is.''","Yes!","Guys!","Good, you're all here!","Opal, Beifong, and I rescued everyone.","But we had a run in with Kuvira.","We saw her super spirit weapon up close.","Like, ''really'' close.","''Way'' too close.","Ooh!","And Zhu Li's on our side now.","Actually, she never really switched sides and I'm just gonna let her explain the whole thing.","Zhu Li?","Varrick!","Good, you're here.","Can I talk to you for a minute?","Well, I went to Zaofu and saved Su and her family ... and guess who else we found?","Ha!","Now, isn't there something you wanted to say to her?","Hmm?","It's too powerful!","It can destroy the city.","Guys!","I see something.","Down there!","Oh, did I forget to mention it?","No, of course I didn't know!","I know what happens next!","We gotta get out of here, now!","Now!","What should we do?","How are we supposed to fight an entire army, a mecha giant, and that crazy weapon?","Go ahead, take your time, just bending a giant wall!","Man, have we got a lot of people hurt!","''Is that everybody?!","Gah!''","This is my hometown and I hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing!","Let her take the city for now!","We'll think of some way to come back and beat her!","You're about to get the world's largest hot foot, metal lady!","Hit it now!","''Opal!''","Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha suits but not the big one?","Be with you in one second!","Kind of busy!","Okay, ready now!","Kuvira must've done some override thing and taken control!","Ummm ... Want to fill me in?","Let's back it up, okay?","I said ''that'' will make the vines ''explode''.","Okay, but for the record, I do not approve.","Just, get out as soon as you can.","Promise?","I love you.","Look!","You're okay!","And though the battle took a severe toll on our beloved city, out of the destruction, love did bloom!","So that is why, dearest friends and family, we gather today to celebrate the wondrous, and at time inexplicable bond between Sir Varrick and the Lady Zhu Li!","True love is a fickle creature.","Difficult to find, nearly impossible to tame.","But Varrick and Zhu Li have proven that even the longest of long shots can have a chance at happiness together.","Now, for the vows!","Thank you, Master Pabu.","Do you, Sir Iknik Blackstone Varrick of the Southern Water Tribe, Master of the High Seas, take the Lady Zhu Li Moon to be your lawfully wedded wife?","Will you promise to treat her not as your assistant, but as your honored and cherished partner?","You may now do the thing."]},"Mako":{"combined_dialog":["Psst, Bolin.","Come on, Bolin, we're up.","Barely!","Oh, you're still here?","You're the Avatar, and I'm an idiot.","Not bad.","Hasook's a no-good no-show!","Well, there goes our shot at the tournament ... and the winnings.","No way.","I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there.","We are?","This girl is crazy.","Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive.","In fact, don't do anything.","Just try not to get knocked off the ring.","Korra ... what can I say?","You ''really'' came alive in that last round.","The way you dodged their attacks ... you ''are'' a natural.","So, ''anyway'', how are we gonna come up with the money?","Come on, Bolin.","We need ''serious'' ideas.","Nah.","I got it.","Your best friend is a ... polar bear dog.","Somehow, that makes perfect sense.","Well, this is his usual hangout.","You guys seen my brother around here today?","When?","What was he doing?","And then what?","Why did he leave?","The Triple Threat Triad's headquarters.","Hopefully Bolin's there and nothing's gone down yet.","That's Pabu!","We gotta hurry.","Something's not right.","There're usually thugs posted out front.","We better be cautious.","Bolin?","You in here?","Bolin!","Calm down, it'll wear off.","Those guys were chi blockers.","They're Amon's henchmen.","Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists.","And you think they'll know where Bolin is?","Bolin's the only family I have left.","If anything happened to him ... \"Witness the Revelation tonight, nine o' clock\".","What's this \"Revelation\"?","Where's it happening?","This is the place.","What are you doing?","I knew a lot of people hated benders, but I've never seen so many in one place.","Keep your eyes out for Bolin.","This guy's insane!","Wait, we can't fight them all.","We need to be smart about this.","You, too.","Come on ...

Let's get out of here!","I'm sorry I didn't believe you.","But Asami's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe.","Even now.","So ... does your offer to live in the Air Temple still stand?","Thank you so much.","Thanks for sending the Air Acolytes to help us with the move.","Trust me, it could've been worse.","So, where are we going to be staying?","Come on, what's wrong?","You can tell us.","Yeah and remember.","Aang hadn't mastered all the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation.","He was just a little kid.","We got your back Korra, and we can save this city.","Together.","Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits.","I like the new Team Avatar's style.","That's them!","After you.","What?","You can't do that!","Let her go!","Korra, listen to him.","It's not worth it.","Are you done yet?","Asami!","Are you all right?","No.","No, she can't be gone!","Do you have any leads?","We need Naga!","She can track Korra.","I know where to start looking!","Come on!","The truck with Bolin took off down this alley.","There!","Korra has to be in there ... somewhere.","Let's try this way.","Then we pick another tunnel until we find her!","What about Korra?","Avatar Korra.","Where are you keeping her?","Why would Tarrlok make up a story about getting attacked?","That sounds like Naga!","Down there!","Give her some space!","I was so worried.","Are you all right?","You're safe now.","Can I get some hot water?","Korra needs more tea.","Is there something we need to talk about?","What?","No!","She was taken by a crazy bloodbender!","How did you expect me to act?","The truth?","About what?","Yes!","Because I don't know what you're talking about!","Look, things are crazy right now.","Can we deal with our relationship problems later?","Asami!","Relax, the city is under attack.","The police have more important things to worry about.","I think I will.","Uh, guys ... look.","Korra, we should get moving.","Relax.","General Iroh's coming with an entire fleet of battleships.","Then Amon will be the one who's running.","We were ''doing'' reconnaissance.","Can't sleep either?","Me too.","I know, we didn't even know each other then.","And now, I can't imagine my life without you in it.","You're the most loyal, brave, and selfless person I've ever known.","Me too.","Good night.","Coast is clear.","They're here!","I don't see any mecha tanks, either.","What now?","They flew in from this direction.","The airfield must be somewhere over this mountain range.","What?","She won't be.","I'm going with you.","Yes, I do.","Love you, little bro.","Asami.","I'm sorry things got so messed up between us, but whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.","We need to get into the temple.","Then, when he returns ...","Uh, we were just transferred.","The arena?","For what?","Uh, we're not alone up here.","Did you know this all along?","How did you figure out Amon is your brother?","We can't.","Any attack we throw at him, he'll redirect with his mind.","That's how he's been able to challenge any bender.","How?","At the rally.","And undermine this whole revolution!","We said what we had to.","Let's get out of here.","He's trying to bait you.","Let her go!","Korra!","Everything will be all right!","We just need to get out of here.","Bro, not the time.","Korra, wait.","I will, but I just want you to know, I'm here for you.","What are you talking about?","I don't care if you're the Avatar or not.","Listen, when Tarrlok took you I was losing my mind at the thought of never seeing you again, I realized ...","I love you, Korra.","Korra!","Looks like you had some car trouble.","Good thing the police are here.","So I walk up and say: \"Looks like you had some car trouble.","Good thing the police are here.\"","Yeah!","I had a few others.","Let's see, uh ... \"Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad\", huh?","Or, \"when you get to jail, tell 'em Mako sent ya\".","Okay, I'll use that next time.","Beifong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon.","Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.","I'm not taking his side, I'm just ... Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?","Sir.","Uh ... No ... uh ...","I ... no.","Good luck.","Sounds good.","What does Tenzin think?","Well what?","I guess you should do what you think is right.","I support whatever decision you make.","I thought you wanted me to be supportive?","Now you want me to tell you what I think?","Make up your mind!","I don't know.","I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing.","But I know your heart is in the right place.","You'll just have to trust it.",".","He said he'd be here, but I can't worry about it.","I have to make sure you have everything you need for a safe trip.","The Everstorm?","Uh, where'd you get the ride?","Well, what do you know?","Looks like-- My brother doesn't like ghost stories.","I think we're here.","Bolin, just stay calm, there's no reason to- panic!","Is everyone okay?","Oh, great.","There goes our equipment.","Now what are we supposed to do?","Don't worry sir, I'll keep an eye on Korra for you.","Nothing, he was just worried about you, that's all.","There aren't any sides.","We all just want to help however we can.","You have to trust that we're here for you.","Wait a second, there's no way she's going alone.","Good luck.","I can't believe it.","You never cease to amaze me.","It's harder being the Avatar's boyfriend.","Uh, you all right, bro?","Uh, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her.","Yeah.","Guys do that all the time.","Just tell her you're not that into her anymore.","Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a blood-sucking leech.","You just gotta rip it off and get it over with.","You'll feel a lot better afterwards.","Trust me.","How was your day, sweetie?","Uh, do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen?","I'm still not clear on that.","How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff, and we go out for a quiet dinner.","Just the two of us.","I though you were breaking up with her.","What happened to \"ripping off the leech\"?","So it was more like you tugged at the leech.","Korra's parents were arrested?","Wait, how are your girl problems my fault?","The coast is clear.","You can come out.","I'm gonna go see how Korra's doing.","What happened?","Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief.","It was a setup.","If you do this, there's no going back.","Of course, I'll help.","I don't even want to know.","If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father.","Um, why do you have a plane on your boat?","What is that?","I'm all yours.","Maybe you should sit this out.","I just think having you there blatantly supporting one side will only make things worse.","You could at least try to seem neutral.","Whatever, I gotta go to work.","I don't know, Bolin.","Figure something out.","Hey!","Stop!","Republic City Police!","I saw a firebender running away from the blast.","The North might not be responsible for this.","I'm sure he cares, but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the South Pole that has nothing to do with them.","What's with you and sides?","Why do you always think I'm working against you?","I'm doing my ''job''.","Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't keep messing it up!","You're the one who's like this!","Uh-huh.","What?","That's a terrible idea!","Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here.","Something doesn't make sense about this bombing.","I just don't buy that the Northern Water Tribe was behind it.","Wait a second!","That's him!","That's the guy that attacked the center!","I gotta go show this to Beifong!","I got a break in the bombing case.","I I.D.","'d the guy I saw at the scene.","You think?","I'm sorry, I just-- um, I found something out about the bombing.","This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions.","He's a member of the Agni Kais.","Someone must have hired him to make it look like ''Northerners'' attacked the Cultural Center.","Did you learn anything about that remote control I found at the scene?","That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible.","Thank you, sir.","Yes, sir.","Yes, sir.","Wait, there's something you should know.","Korra, let me explain.","Look, the President of the Republic asked me a direct question.","What was I supposed to do?","Enough!","Look, I have a job to do!","I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another ''huge'' mistake!","Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our ''relationship''!","Yeah.","I guess I am.","I broke up with the Avatar.","I'm so sorry.","Your entire shipment was stolen.","Don't worry.","I'm gonna find whoever's responsible.","Chief Beifong is about to question the captain of the ship.","Like the bombs at the cultural center.","I gotta grab some evidence.","Chief, I think there's a link between this attack and the attack at the cultural center.","Solving this case.","Did any of the people who attacked you have one of these in their hand?","I think it's a remote detonator.","Chief, I don't think the people who attacked were Northern Water Tribe.","Was this one of the guys who attacked?","Chief, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys.","Lu and Gang are idiots.","I hate them and their stupid mustaches.","A sting operation.","I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it.","It's not that easy.","For the plan to work, we need the police, and Beifong already said no.","I don't know.","I don't want to go behind Beifong's back.","If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force.","I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job.","First of all, we'd need a ship.","All right, I'm in.","Let's get these guys.","Not yet.","We need some extra manpower.","Right, uh ... Korra.","Yeah, actually, she's um ... she's out of town right now.","Yeah, yeah.","Forget about Korra.","I'll go talk to Bolin.","Is this a marble statue of you?","We don't even have hats.","I don't have time to take a dipity dip, okay?","I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help.","You're sitting in a hot tub.","Are you gonna help or not?","So that's a no.","What am I supposed to do now?","No, but it's our last resort.","I'm not here on police business.","I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action.","I am personal friends with that Avatar.","I ''might'' be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back.","This is right around the area where the attacks happened.","So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet.","Two Toed Ping, please.","Ping, stay focused!","There's nothing to know.","I broke up with her.","I don't know.","All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?","Wait, guys.","Do you hear that?","Ah!","What's taking so long?","I'm gonna check it out.","I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper.","We've been double-crossed.","We have to get off this ship.","They're getting closer.","Watch out!","We're not gonna make it.","One down, one to go.","Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted.","Whoever paid the Triple Threats stole everything.","We should check out your other warehouses.","Maybe they didn't have time to hit them all.","We have to search the place for evidence.","If we can find a lead ...","I can figure this out.","Well, I'm not giving up on you.","Uh ...","It's-it's okay.","Um ...","Anyway ...","I gotta run.","I'm gonna find out who did this.","And I know just who to ask.","Who hired you to double-cross us?","I think you do know.","And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to \"No Toed Ping\".","You expect me to believe that?","Get out of here.","Bolin, have you seen Varrick around?","Bolin!","Nuktuk.","Where's Varrick?","I need to ask him something.","How did you rig those explosions to go off like that?","Varrick.","Asami, I think I know who set us up.","What are you doing here?","Yeah, and I'm ''real'' close to proving it.","I'll fill you in later.","Asami, there you are.","Is Bolin around?","Good.","I've got something to tell you both.","I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries: Varrick.","Yes!","It was a ploy.","He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it.","He already had all the shipping.","All he needed was Future Industries.","I ''am'' stressed!","Dating?","No!","Guys, listen to me.","Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof.","The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the cultural center attack.","And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when Asami's shipment was hijacked.","Don't you see?","Gah!","No!","I'm not going to let it go!","Go ahead.","Torture me all you want.","I'm not gonna talk.","Know what?","I have a job.","What are you saying?","Thanks for your ''concern'', but the answer is no.","Did you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?","I'm fine.","No, thanks.","I'm a little busy.","Maybe I do need to get my mind off things.","What's going on?","All right.","It's true.","We were trying to figure out who stole Asami's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation.","I'm sorry for going behind your back.","You're gonna believe a bunch of criminals?","I don't know where those came from.","None of that is mine.","That's not true, Asami.","I would never do anything to hurt you.","It's ''Varrick''.","This is all ''Varrick''.","He set me up!","I am not a criminal!","I was set up!","Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war.","That's why he had me arrested.","No!","I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems.","Where's Asami?","She'll listen to me.","Bolin, wait.","If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere.","Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.","So, how was the big premiere?","Wait, wh-what?","I knew it!","Don't worry about it bro.","Korra ... hey, I missed you, too.","So you're not still mad at me?","We had that fight before you left, remember?","Uh ... No.","No, it wasn't that bad.","We're not interested in your tea.","And this isn't a friendly visit.","It's okay.","We're going to stop Unalaq, and get Jinora back.","I'm sure he's fine.","What's up with the coat?","And where did you get that pie?","Will you keep it down?","I'm waiting for the right moment.","I hate it when you listen to me.","Fine!","Uh ... Um ...","Uh no, no, nothing.","Don't worry, there's no way they'll be expecting this.","We tried.","We don't need to win, we just need to stop Unalaq from getting back in the Spirit World.","Please, let us out.","Come on, your dad has become an evil monster.","He's gonna bring on eternal darkness.","Why would you protect someone who doesn't care about you at all?","Yes!","Wow!","That was the best acting I've ever seen.","You completely fooled her.","They're coming for Korra!","I don't even know what to say.","Hey, can we talk?","There's something I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had.","I know I said it wasn't that bad, but, that's not exactly true.","I, um ... I-I broke up with you.","But, I thought you said you lost part of your memory.","That's okay.","I think we've both said things that we regret.","I know I should have, but ...","I didn't wanna hurt you all over again.","I guess part of me wanted to forget about the break-up too.","You're right.","I'll always love you, Korra.","Ow!","Police.","He what?","Slow down.","Okay, I'm on my way.","What the heck did all this?","Okay, just tell me what happened.","Like what?","Sir, that's impossible.","There are only five airbenders in the entire world, and, your brother is not one of them.","Police.","Open up.","Get out here, sir, or I'm knocking this door down.","One, two-- I got a call last night.","About a guy who just started ''airbending'' out of nowhere.","He ... blew a door down on me and got away.","We got an all-points bulletin out on him right now.","Oh, well, y'know, you should leave it with the police.","It's ... police business.","Y'know.","It's um ... official.","No, I'm fine.","I should just, get going.","So, as you were ladies.","Of course, Korra.","Avatar.","Avatar Korra.","Once I received your message I proceeded to contact various locations within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by you, the Avatar.","There are reports of airbenders popping up all over the Earth Kingdom.","I marked the villages on this map.","You guys can take it with you.","Really?","Uh, it's probably better if I sit this one out.","I'm sorry, I can't.","Korra already asked, bro.","I can't just leave Republic City.","I have a life here, and a job.","It's not just that.","I feel like I've been drifting apart from everyone.","Okay, all right, I'll come with you.","I guess I gotta call Beifong.","She's not going to be happy.","As of now, these are the towns where we've gotten reports about airbenders.","It looks like we can hit up most of them before we get to Ba Sing Se.","Korra, enough!","Let's get out of here!","I am the escaped convict, and you will all reap my fire.","Ah!","Hey!","Let me go!","This is not what we rehearsed!","Korra!","Guys!","I think we got trouble.","Right here, I found him slipping away.","With your stash of gold?","Enough with the lies kid.","I want the truth.","I just want you to know that I'm going to be watching you, kid.","I know exactly what you're all about, 'cause I've been there.","You don't have me fooled.","I knew that kid was no good.","He was just waiting for an opportunity to run away again.","What's the point?","He obviously doesn't care about us.","Fine.","Bolin and I will find him.","Kai!","Get back here!","What are you doing running around robbing people?","Yeah right.","Let's go.","You're in big trouble.","Hey!","Your little brother, huh?","Reminds me of my little brother.","All right.","Let's see if we can catch a train back to the Upper Ring.","I bet everyone's freaking out that we've been gone all night.","I don't want any part of it.","Besides, look at this fruit, it's disgusting.","We don't want to steal this.","No, I just said I don't want any of this rotten fruit.","So you want me to steal it?","How do you know our names?","I'm sorry, they were killed when we were little.","So why did Dad leave Ba Sing Se?","We actually need to get back to the Avatar in the Upper Ring.","We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders in Ba Sing Se.","We have to get back to the Upper Ring and tell Korra.","Thanks.","I know this wasn't easy.","I wished we could stay.","But if it's true the Earth Queen is forcing airbenders into her army, we have to do something about it.","We will, Grandma.","The Earth Queen's been secretly taking away airbenders and ''forcing'' them into her army.","I bet they're under Lake Laogai.","What?","I've been reading some of Jinora's books.","The old Dai Li agents used to have a secret fortress beneath the lake.","Why were they trying to kidnap Korra?","Come on.","We're getting you out.","Then don't tell him.","Yes, we can!","I had a lot of money in that wallet!","A city called Zaofu, the home of the Metal Clan.","You've done your research.","Uh, that's because you escaped prison.","So, you and Opal seemed to hit it off dinner.","I think she's really into you.","Right, I forgot.","Your type is dumb mover star or psycho ice princess.","Hey, has anyone seen Chief Beifong?","I'll do it.","Uhh, Chief, you've been sleeping for sixteen hours.","We just wanted to make sure that you're okay.","Whoa.","Nice shot, Bolin!","But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending.","What's going on?","I can't hear anything.","I hate sitting down here!","Uh, not because of you.","Let her go!","They've got Korra!","We can't let them take her.","Bolin can land a shot.","Copy that.","It's Bolin time.","You have to!","No go!","I said no!","Wait!","Bolin, take the shot!","Haha, nice job, little bro!","I got something!","It looks like it's from them.","\"Team assembled.","Ready to rendezvous.\"","Let's go confront him with this evidence right now.","I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard ''right now''.","Every minute we waste here, those guys get further away.","I mean, how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals anyway?","That guard is only eighteen years old and has lived in Zaofu his entire life.","Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than thirteen years.","What were you saying about the evidence?","Oh, you mean exactly like what you did to me?","You're right.","All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fallback.","For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city: Aiwei.","We have to get in there and find some evidence that links Aiwei to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us.","Bolin, put that back!","We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything.","You forgot where it goes, didn't you?","These look like scuff marks.","I think this bookshelf slides open.","Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.","But don't you think it's weird how young he is?","How did he ever get mixed up with this group?","Come on, he's getting away!","He's gone.","And he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here.","He had an escape plan all ready to go.","Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought, and more dangerous.","Let's ask around.","Maybe someone's seen him.","No.","Those are wanted posters, and there's one for each of us.","\"Wanted by Her Majesty, the Earth Queen, for crimes against the Kingdom.\"","I'm guessing this is because we took her airbenders.","Bolin and I will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis, and see if he's hold up there.","No.","You and Asami wait here in case he comes back.","Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves.","Enough!","Let's just find Aiwei.","I'm a cop.","I don't have a backstory.","Let's see if this guy knows anything.","Excuse me, sir?","We're looking for a man about sixty, balding, wearing glasses in a long green robe.","That's him!","Any idea where he is now?","No luck here.","We've been made.","Let's lose 'em!","Okay, I think we're clear.","We should head back to Korra before someone else recognizes us.","All right.","Stay cool and follow my lead.","Keep an eye on him.","I'll go get Korra.","We found Aiwei hiding in an inn.","No.","Once Aiwei knows we're onto him, we lose our advantage.","I say we stake out his room and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him.","Good afternoon.","We'd like a room on the ground floor, across from 102, please.","We'll just take the one across from 102.","Trust me, it'll be perfect.","Kind of busy here, bro.","Assuming we do find Zaheer, what then?","He was locked away for thirteen years, Korra, and never broke.","I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy.","Yeah, we spy on them.","If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely.","Then we'll find out who they are and what they want.","No, I just saw him peeking out of his window fifteen minutes ago.","It's in my logbook.","Korra, wait!","You're going to blow our element of surprise.","We'll watch him in case he wakes up.","Be careful!","Uh, I don't know how, but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us.","I just said I don't know how!","Get Korra out of here.","Bolin and I will hold them off.","If you think holding us hostage will give you some leverage against the Avatar, you're gonna be very disappointed.","And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu?","You had her paralyzed.","Why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?","Bolin, would you stop making friends with the bad guys?","We have to find a way out of here before Zaheer gets his hands on Korra.","Listen.","Bolin, this is up to you.","I know you can metalbend.","Yes you can.","I believe in you.","You've always had the ability deep down.","You just haven't had the motivation.","But this is your time!","Get us out of here to save Korra.","You can do it!","Bolin!","Bolin!","We have to get out of here, Bolin.","Zaheer came here to take out the Earth Queen, and now Korra is next.","Shut up!","You have to metalbend us out of here.","C'mon!","I know you can do it!","This is your time!","I know I did it, but now it's ''really'' your time.","Do it!","I don't think that was you.","I can't believe it!","The Upper Ring is in chaos!","This isn't our battle.","We have to deliver Zaheer's message to Korra immediately.","We need an airship.","Excuse me, may I have your attention please?","I'm with the Republic City Police and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar.","What, they took everything.","I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?","You know how to fly this thing?","Up!","Up!","The whole city is falling to pieces.","Move over, we're getting them out.","Yeah.","No, Grandma.","I'm not sure where we're gonna take you, but right now, we need to find Korra.","I'm afraid so.","Her airship went down somewhere in the desert.","She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading to Ba Sing Se.","If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage.","That's a Ba Sing Se airship, all right.","But where's the rest of it?","Okay, all right, Naga.","It's good to see you, too.","Gah!","Stop!","You're licking my mouth.","You guys are okay!","Don't get all mushy on me, Chief.","Tonraq.","Sir.","Uhm, forgive my brother.","We're just really honored to meet you, Sir.","Uh, actually, that's Asami.","This is Avatar Korra.","Korra, this is my grandma, Yin.","We were captured by Zaheer and taken to Ba Sing Se.","We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown.","Zaheer let us go.","Zaheer is headed to the Northern Air Temple as we speak.","He said he's gonna wipe out the new Air Nation and everyone in it.","Unless you turn yourself over to him.","He's already taken out the Earth Queen.","I don't think he bluffs.","I agree.","Unfortunately, we don't have a radio on the airship.","We'll never make it up there before Zaheer.","Guys.","We got through to the air

turn yourself over until I get a visual on them.","They're here.","And so is the lavabender.","Korra, it was a trick!","They're not here.","Don't turn yourself over!","Chief, get Korra out of there.","Now!","Now what?","Bolin!","You're a lavabender.","It was all Bolin.","I thought we were done for, then out of nowhere, he ''lavabends''.","Well, why didn't you say something?","Must be more Red Lotus members than we thought.","Hey.","Um, I appreciate you coming back for us.","Sorry for ever giving you a hard time.","Yeah, you kind of did.","That's got to be where they took Korra.","We're going with you.","You help Korra, we got this.","You have no water.","It's over.","Prince Wu!","President Raiko has some really important ... king stuff to talk to you about.","He's a ''real'' charmer, huh?","Well, I just remind myself that once he's on the throne, I go back to being a detective.","I also go home, and smash my head into the wall for an hour, you know, just to get the stress out.","I haven't talked to him for a while, but he's coming in a few days for the coronation.","And Beifong told me that Korra is getting in tonight.","I don't know why we're leaving so early if you're just getting a haircut.","The dinner at Air Temple Island isn't until later tonight.","Are you kidding me?","What are you having done that takes four hours?","Yeah, I'm ... not interested.","That's ''disgusting''!","I don't know if all those people are your fans.","Wu, we have to get you out of here!","Go!","Go!","I think those were Kuvira's supporters in the crowd.","That's not blood.","It's strawberry pie.","You would have been hit by a pie.","It's really not that big of a deal.","You're allergic to bee stings!","Ugh.","This coronation cannot come soon enough.","I can't wait to go back to being a detective.","What?","No!","nan Get better soon!","Shouldn't you be getting ready to, I don't know ... rule a whole nation?","Yay ... You sure that's the guy you want running the Earth Kingdom?","And you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?","Bolin!","Look at you!","My little brother got all ... ''important''.","So, what's it like working for Kuvira?","From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.","Well, I've been working for Wu.","And, uhhh ... Yeah.","No.","She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he said she left the South Pole months ago.","No one knows where she is.","Don't worry about me.","I'll ... find a way to make it.","He's my brother.","You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira now that she's going against the wishes of the entire world, are you?","I don't know, bro.","By \"crushing\" anyone who gets in your way?","It seems like she's just a dictator who's taking the Earth Kingdom by force.","Well, no, but still ...","I'm sorry, I don't want to work for your glorious emperor and her military dictatorship.","I can't believe him!","Yeah.","Okay.","We need to get you out of here.","Okay, you're losing it.","Why?","Do you really ''want'' to be the king?","I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator, but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth Kingdom somewhat better.","If you were an Earth Kingdom citizen, do you think you're the kind of person you want as ''your'' king?","What have you ever done for your people?","I'm sorry, that was out of line.","Let's get you out of here and back to someplace safe.","No.","Korra!","Sorry, but I couldn't ditch him.","But he promised to be on his best behavior.","Wait, when did she tell you she couldn't?","What's going on with you two?","Well, why didn't you ever write to me?","Or Bolin?","\"Hello\" would have been nice.","Why would she ... Never mind.","I'm not gonna hold your hand every time you have to empty your \"royal bladder\".","Go to the bathroom on your own for once.","I don't go ''with'' him, with him, I just stand there in the general vicinity while he ...","I don't wanna talk about it.","I wonder what's taking Wu so long.","He's not one to miss out on lunch.","I'll go check on him.","Wu, are you in here?","Come on, your octopus fritters are getting cold.","Hang a right at the next block.","We can cut them off on Seventh.","You missed the turn!","Where are you going?!","What are you doing?","Sit down!","Where's the prince?","Take this guy in for booking.","Charge him with kidnapping and tell Chief Beifong that Prince Wu is missing.","Put out an all-points bulletin.","We'll keep looking.","Or they might try smuggling him out on an airship.","He could be anywhere!","The ''one'' time I don't watch him pee and ''this'' is what happens.","So, how do you know where Wu is just by touching some spirit vines?","Is that even possible?","Which train is Wu on?","Split up and start looking.","How do you know for sure he's here?","And I'm just supposed to trust your \"Avatar Feelings\"?","Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared.","Wu!","Wu, it's me.","No, you're on a train.","We're gonna get you out of here.","You all right?","You should be thanking Korra.","We never would have found you with out her.","Actually, that is like old times for me and Korra.","Yeah, but it's great to have you back.","I think I know just the place.","I don't.","This is Asami's place.","She was nice enough to let my family stay here after they fled Ba Sing Se.","Grandma, this is Prince Wu.","He needs to stay with you and the family for a little while.","She loves royalty.","Yeah, I agree.","Let's toughen you up.","Look at you!","You're so weak, \"Wu down\" is your catchphrase.","You don't know anything about me, do you?","Uhh ... you never asked?","Not since Korra and I broke up.","Bolin and I were playing for the Fire Ferrets.","Yes.","Will you just let me tell the story?","Come on, Bolin, we're up.","You know what else is rude?","''Interrupting''.","Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender and a loyal friend.","She helped me save Bolin when he was taken by the Equalists.","After going through such a crazy experience, I felt like Korra and I had a powerful connection.","Not exactly.","Ahhhh!","Hey.","When you got charm like mine, you don't need introductions.","Hanging out with Asami was awesome.","But it made things with Korra complicated.","We need to talk.","No, I haven't.","What I'm trying to say is, as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing.","Tu!","Get out of here!","Guys, Grandma, everything wasn't so cut and dry.","I wasn't ''dating'' Asami.","But my feelings for Korra became clear when Tarrlok captured her.","It felt like a piece of me was gone.","I was so worried.","Are you all right?","Things are crazy right now.","Can we deal with our relationship problems later?","''Asami''!","Yep.","Turns out, she was right.","It was time to man up and call it quits.","Asami.","I'm sorry things got so messed up between us.","But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.","Trust me, I wasn't.","Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together and after that, I was finally able to tell her how I felt.","Exactly how I felt.","I love you, Korra.","Ummmm ... Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.","I'm not taking his side.","There aren't any sides!","What's with you and sides?","Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!","Yeah ...","I guess I am.","After that, I dove into my work.","Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe.","Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps.","The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra.","It was an intense night.","Asami and I discovered the triads had double-crossed us.","We barely got away, but by then, Asami's warehouse had been cleared out.","Well ...","I'm not giving up on ''you''.","I know, I know, don't tell me ...","I had no right kissing Asami.","If only it had been that simple.","Korra ... hey, I-I missed you, too.","So you're not still mad at me?","We had that fight before you left, remember?","Ahhhhh ... Hmmmm, no.","No.","It-it wasn't that bad.","Well, me and Asami were never ''officially'' back together.","Well, eventually, I did tell Korra.","But by then, she already knew.","I know I should have, but ...","I didn't want to hurt you all over again.","I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup, too.","You're right.","After Harmonic Convergence, the world changed.","Team Avatar traveled around, searching for new airbenders.","At first, it was awkward being around Korra and Asami.","As you were.","Ladies.","But then I realized I had to figure out who I was without a lady in my life.","You did?","Good.","Korra!","Bolin, I'm so glad you're back.","I was worried about you.","Hello, anyone?","Wait.","Do you hear that?","Korra, look.","What are those?","Let's get them out.","Korra!","What's wrong?","What are you talking about?","I'm here for you.","What do you need?","Are you sure you're ready for this?","So ... how are you doing?","Do you think you're finally able to forget about what Zaheer did to you?","Nice job in there.","I'm proud of you.","You're starting to act like the kind of king I'd like to work for.","You always have to ruin it.","The problem is, it's a voluntary evacuation and there aren't very many volunteers.","They just don't feel like they're in any immediate danger.","We're on it.","Attention citizens of Republic City.","This is not a test.","An attack on our city is imminent.","President Raiko has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all citizens.","Please find your evacuation handbooks and turn to subsection one-dash-two-six.","There you will find initial instructions for your area.","For example, if you live in northwest vector one, report to your primary meeting location, which would be at the eastern entrance of the Southern Water Tribe library.","There, you would choose a leader as specified in section one-dash-two-eight.","What's confusing?","I'm giving very specific instructions.","We ''can't'' let it get to our doorstep.","This doesn't make sense.","There aren't any train tracks this way.","How are they transporting that super weapon of theirs?","Did you know Kuvira was building that thing?","Guys!","She must have our location!","She's pointing that weapon right at us!","What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet?","If Kuvira finds out that Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out.","I'm going for that lever.","You get the other one.","I'm ready!","One ... two ... three!","Nothing's happening!","There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here.","Come on.","You spent all that time working with Varrick and Baatar Jr.","Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?","I'm gonna zap these vines with some electricity.","Exactly.","This is our only way of shutting this thing down.","I can handle it.","I don't have time to argue!","I'm doing this, so get out of here!","Promise.","I love you, too.","Now go!","Korra!","Tenzin, there's no sign of her.","My cousin told me how level-headed you were during the whole evacuation.","I got to admit, I'm impressed.","I think you're going to make a great leader.","But that doesn't mean I'm gonna set you up with Korra, so don't ask.","Are ... you joking?","That's ... actually pretty wise and mature of you.","Much better.","You don't need to say

last warning.","Stay out of my ''way''!","Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom, but the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down.","The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists or even be associated with them.","It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall.","That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands.","We must pass this law.","All in favor?","Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here.","This is an Equalist rally.","There is nothing

you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar!","My life is a disaster now, thanks to you.","I ''was'' his son, but in order to win Republic City, I had to become someone else.","My father failed because

you're coming as my hostage.","Amon!","You fool!","You've never faced bending like mine.","What?","What are you?","I don't suppose you're here to rescue me.","No, I'm the only one.","I'm Amon's brother.","Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe.","He's a waterbender and a bloodbender, just like I was.","No, not until after he captured me.","It all began with my father, Yakone.","With the help of his former gang, he escaped prison and underwent surgery to change his appearance.","He assumed a new identity, and settled down in the Northern Water Tribe.","That's where he met my mother, a warm, caring woman.","Before long, they started a family together.","Amon was the firstborn, under the name Noatak.","I was born three years later.","Noatak was a good-natured kid, always looking out for me.","Those were the good years.","Before my brother and I discovered we were waterbenders.","At first we were excited by our new abilities, but our training brought out a different side of my father.","I'm trying, but- Even back then, my brother wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally.","When I was seven, my father took me and Noatak on a hunting trip far away from our home.","He told us his true identity was Yakone, Republic City's most notorious crime boss, and that he was once a bloodbender of rare skill.","What's bloodbending?","The good days were behind us.","Every full moon, our father took us on another supposed \"hunting trip,\" where he secretly trained us in bloodbending.","We kept the truth from my mother.","Stop!","You're hurting it!","A few years later, my father taught us to bloodbend anytime, without the need of the full moon.","We practiced constantly, and I hated every minute of it.","I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals.","My brother, however, seemed to revel in this newfound power.","He was a prodigy, mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen.","No.","I won't do it.","That felt awful.","I don't want to do that to anyone.","I never want to bloodbend again.","Run away?","But what about Mom?","We can't just leave her.","Noatak!","Don't leave!","Please!","Noatak!","My father and I searched for days, but we never found a sign of Noatak.","We thought he perished in that storm.","My mother was never the same after the loss of my brother.","My father stopped training me.","With Noatak gone, his hopes for revenge withered.","And he passed away, a few years later.","Avatar Korra.","I am truly sorry for all that I did to you.","I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me.","I became a soldier of revenge, just like he wanted me to be.","And so did my brother.","The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes bending is the source of all evil in the world.","When he took my bending, the sensation was somehow familiar.","I later recognized it as my brother's bloodbending grip.","I don't know ''how'' he does it, but then again, I've never encountered a bender as strong as Noatak.","Go.","Amon can't know anyone spoke with me.","Defeat him.","Put an end to this sad story.","Noatak.","Yes, Noatak.","It will be just like the good old days."]},"Fire Nation councilwoman":{"combined_dialog":["Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal, but who would even head up such a task force?"]},"Asami":{"combined_dialog":["Oh, no!","I'm

What?","I don't believe this.","My father is innocent.","Just because we're not benders doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists.","Okay, you did your search.","Now you can all leave.","What are you doing here?","I think I would've noticed if there were a factory underneath my house.","The lies you people come up with just to persecute my father.","In his workshop, behind the house.","Dad?","Hello?","I don't understand.","There must be an explanation.","I have to find out the truth about my father.","All right.","Be careful.","Dad, stop!","Why?","I love you, Dad.","Yes, they've been amazing.","Such tireless workers.","Oh.","Uh, no.","I wasn't completely aware of that.","I think it's really charming and the best part about it, nothing here reminds me of my father.","Thank you for your hospitality.","Thank you for having me.","No, that's nonsense!","You're amazing!","I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon.","Hmm.","I think I have the answer.","You think this'll do?","My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars.","I guess now I know why.","Korra!","Bolin!","Give me a ramp!","Now!","Help me out!","We gotta make this turn!","They don't know we made the turn.","Okay, get ready.","Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous.","They're not Equalists, they're just normal people who want their rights back.","Hey!","Let me go!","Thanks.","I owe you.","I'm fine!","It's so good to see you.","Underground ... just like my father's secret factory.","Figures.","Which way?","And what if Korra's not down there?","Hey, is Mako all right?","He seems really worried about Korra.","I know, but, he's your brother.","Do you think that he likes Korra as more than just a friend?","They ... kissed?","I doubt that.","Bolin, that really happened.","He knocked us out.","Let me help.","Pema, are you all right?","Should I get Tenzin?","You're a firebender.","Boil it yourself.","I've noticed how you treat Korra.","How you acted when she was missing.","You have feelings for her, don't you?","I like Korra.","But you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time.","You're really going to make me say it?","The kiss, Mako.","I know.","Don't blame your brother for what ''you'' did.","Do you have feelings for Korra or not?","Where did you say you parked the car?","Wow, nice parking job.","This'll come in handy.","Why don't you sit in back?","With ''Korra.''","Jump!","You two were gone a while.","Whatever.","It's time to take down my father.","Why not?","I care about you, too.","Why would there be fence posts but no fence?","Are you insane?!","How can we be a family after everything you've done?!","Mom would hate you for what you've become.","How are we gonna get out of here?","Huh, what do you know ... just like a Future Industries forklift.","You don't feel love for Mom anymore.","You're too full of hatred.","You really are a horrible father.","I think these planes are finally ready to ship.","I'm glad you came with me to this meeting.","Varrick is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the entire global shipping business.","So, you're my assistant.","Just stand there and don't say anything.","Thank you for meeting with me.","As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping.","Okay ... but I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track.","If we could hammer out a deal ... You ''are'' a natural assistant!","Where's Varrick?","We should've closed our deal an hour ago.","What did he do?","What?","Don't let her treat you that way.","Stand up for yourself.","Bolin, you need to be honest with her.","Tell her how you really feel.","Where are you?","Your assistant's in there too?","Yeah, you think?","Me too.","So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?","Sorry.","But there's no runway.","How are we supposed to take off?","I better go check on my factory.","Huh?","Hey!","In a hurry?","Yeah, me too.","And my company is about to go under.","I have to find a way to make some sales.","It's dangerous on the seas right now, but I'm willing to try if you are.","Is it true?","Without that sale, I don't know how much longer I can keep my company going.","What am I gonna do?","Wait, where are you going?","Without the money from that shipment, Future Industries is almost broke.","Wait, I think Mako might be onto something.","He's doing a better job than you!","Forget them.","What's this idea of yours?","Let's do it.","We can make it work, just the two of us.","Mako, I need your help.","My Mom is gone.","My Dad is in jail.","Future Industries is all I have left of my family.","The less you know, the better.","The ship's all loaded with the dummy crates.","Let's get this sting operation going.","What about Korra?","No better muscle than the Avatar.","Everything okay with you two?","Are you sure this is a good idea?","I've got vehicles, all brand-new and top of the line.","They can be yours if you help.","You broke up?","When?","Why didn't you tell me?","Because you have two ''extra'' toes.","I didn't hear anything.","Not for long.","We're stalled.","Mako, hang onto something.","What was that all about?","Distracted?","From what?","Oh no.","I'm ruined.","My company ... it's over.","You don't understand.","Everything I had was in here.","Mako ... it doesn't matter anymore.","Just stop.","It's over.","I give up.","Sorry, I- He just saved my company.","Varrick bought a controlling interest in Future Industries.","Isn't that great?","So what were you saying, Mako?","You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?","Varrick invited me to watch some of the filming.","Are you filming right now?","He attacked his own ship?","Varrick helped ''save'' Future Industries.","He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind.","Mako, you seemed stressed.","You guys aren't living together anymore?","Sounds like you've had a pretty busy week.","Maybe you just need to relax.","That's crazy!","Anyone could have gotten their hands on one of those detonators.","Hi.","No.","I just wanted to come by to make sure you're okay.","You seemed so agitated earlier.","Maybe you need a night off.","Why don't we go get some dinner?","Too busy for Kwong's Cuisine?","Remember?","We had our first date there.","That's crazy!","This has to be a mistake.","I think this is your best mover yet.","Are you okay?","It seems like this mover is really getting to you.","You do know Juji's not really dead?","Then what's wrong?","I know.","Things have changed to much since we first met.","Why don't you come back in and finish watching the mover with me?","Bolin you saved the president!","And you proved Mako was right all along.","We have to go tell him what happened.","If you guys need help, I'm here for you.","You stole everything from me and you tried to kidnap the president.","Those are pretty bad, too.","Almost, but ...","I just picked up a distress signal from the southern troops.","There's a problem.","Hold on, maybe Bumi's right.","We don't have a catapult and hog monkeys, but we have a flying bison and there's a plane on Varrick's ship.","Maybe we can attack from above.","Mako, Bolin and I can use the plane to create a distraction, and scatter some of the defenses.","You, Tenzin, Bumi and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening.","Are you ready?!","Get ready!","Fire!","Brace yourselves!","Mhmm.","Yip-yip.","What about Korra and the others?","Don't worry, we'll figure something out.","You can't take that to heart.","People are just frustrated.","Where's Mako?","You're the Avatar, master of all the elements.","You should know how to drive.","Besides, it's relaxing.","Clutch!","Clutch!","That's the brake.","Let's try again.","You ready?","Well, Mako has never been the most ... \"in touch with his feelings\" guy, but it'll get better eventually.","Yeah ... we all knew.","Sorry.","Actually, I need to tell you something about that, and I should have told you this sooner, but ... while you were gone ...","I ... kind of ... kissed him.","I'm sorry.","You're not mad?","You what?","I'm just kidding.","I knew a long time ago.","Vine!","Vine!","Korra, you okay?","Did someone order a fully equipped Future Industries airship?","I figured if we're going to Ba Sing Se to search for airbenders, we should do it in style.","Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder to convince him to join us.","I don't think I've seen him since we landed.","Are you sure we shouldn't have brought more people to collect the tax money?","So much for our escorts.","Hey, I think I can use a break.","You letting off steam is starting to, hurt.","A lot.","Mako.","Bolin.","You're okay.","Where have you been?","Can you interpret that?","It's the Queen.","Because our airship is having engine trouble.","It'll take me until tomorrow to finish the repairs.","Oh great, not the Queen again.","We just got a call from the radio about another airbender.","Aren't you coming?","What are you doing here?","You mean ''my'' company.","Future Industries reverted back to me after ''you'' plotted to abduct the President.","Guys, it's time to get cleaned up.","Tonight is Opal's farewell dinner.","Uh ...","I think it's broken.","I don't think they're going to get far.","Look!","There's no way to cross that moat.","And look at this.","What do you mean?","It's just an empty book.","Aiwei's coming back!","Quick.","We don't know.","And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer.","Uhh, guys ... We should get out of here.","This must be Aiwei's jeep.","He can't be far.","Are you okay?","I don't know.","But I think I found a clue.","All right.","Xai Bau's Grove, where are you?","Go away!","I'm trying to find something.","We found something too.","It looks like he's gonna meet Zaheer at sundown at a place called Xai Bau's Grove.","But I can't find it anywhere on the map.","I'll play.","So?","I learned to play from my dad, the diabolical genius.","I'll destroy you.","Why?","This game is all about slow, methodical strategy.","I don't know what Shady Shin taught you, but it wasn't the real Pai Sho.","Let me see that.","There have been countless variations of Pai Sho through the centuries and each culture has its own rules and variations of the game.","Then I guess I know you pretty well.","I win.","I can't believe it.","You might actually win this one.","Maybe he sneaked out when you weren't looking.","How?","What do we do?","What's the Red Lotus?","And Zaheer didn't capture us, the Earth Queen's forces did.","I'm not sure.","Some camp by the desert.","They're taking us back to Ba Sing Se.","Do I have to be chained to the floor the whole way?","It's going to be so uncomfortable.","Can't you just chain me to that railing?","I mean, where am I gonna go?","Please?","Thank you, Sir.","Don't worry, I have a plan.","These airships the Cabbage Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are ''way'' cheaper than the ones Future Industries built.","Now that's just shoddy workmanship.","There's no way I can get these locks off.","I need the keys.","Give me five minutes, then start yelling for help.","I think you might have been a little over-aggressive with the airbending.","The controls are busted.","Also, you broke the radio.","Hang on to something!","Well.","They say any landing you could walk away from is a good landing.","But, given our location, I'm not so sure about that.","It doesn't look good.","Even if you metalbend the propellers back into shape, we have to dig this whole thing out of the sand.","If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running.","Wait, did that sand dune just move?","That's no mirage.","Look.","How's it looking in there?","Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert.","Kong, you want to see if you can get the engine started?","We might not have a few hours.","Maybe we can still build something to get us all out of here.","No, but we might have enough material to construct a makeshift sand-sailer.","Like the sandbenders use to get around.","All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to.","She ain't pretty, but I think she'll do the job.","You want to buy a slightly used sand-sailer?","Did you find Mako and Bolin?","Uh, so what happened to you two?","Where have you been?","I'll watch over her as she meditates.","Did you find Zaheer?","You can't expect us to sit by and let Zaheer take you.","Be careful, Korra.","It's okay, Tenzin.","We're about to get you out of here.","Where're the airbenders?","Come on.","We have to get to the airship.","Where's Oogi?","How?","There you go.","All fixed up for a formal Avatar appearance.","Take a look.","We should go inside.","I do like the idea of putting you on a train and sending you far, ''far'' away.","Yeah ...","I'm aware of who you are.","Superhuman?","He's ... something.","How can you stand being his bodyguard?","And that works?","It's good to see you, Mako.","It's been too long.","You hear from Bolin lately?","I can't wait to see her.","It's going to be weird, having the old Team Avatar back in the city after all these years.","Are you sure you don't want some company in the Southern Water Tribe?","I'm happy to come with you.","Bye, Korra!","Dear Korra.","I miss you.","It's not the same in Republic City without you.","How are you feeling?","Things are going well here.","I just got a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, so I'll be keeping pretty busy for a while.","I came to return these.","Stop writing me.","I never want to see or hear from you again.","When I first came here, it was because I wanted to tell you ''face to face'' that I never wanted to see or hear from you again.","I wanted my words to hurt you so that you would know how you hurt me.","But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt.","It was sadness.","You tainted our past and destroyed our future together.","I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you.","But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.","I thought we could play some Pai Sho.","Like we used to.","Only three years.","It's so good to see you again.","And I'm loving the hair.","Come on.","Mako got us a table at the restaurant.","So can you go into the Avatar State again?","I was worried when you told me you couldn't.","Well, I kind of have some big news.","I went to visit my father for the first time.","He had been writing me letters and I guess I finally felt ready to try and forgive him.","You think I don't know what my ''own father'' is capable of?","You don't get to disappear for three years and then act like you know what's best for me!","Get in!","I know these streets better than you.","I built some of them!","They must have moved Wu to a different vehicle when we lost sight of them.","Where do we start?","There are ''thousands'' of cars in the city and he could be in any one of them.","Or maybe a boat.","Are you sure?","How do you know?","Who taught you that?","You met ''Toph''?","What was she like?","If we don't find Wu soon, we might never find him.","Guys, shh.","Listen.","But it was kind of like old times.","Except for the getting on each other's nerves part.","It's all right.","I guess after being apart for three years, there's bound to be a bit of an adjustment period.","I've noticed how you treat Korra, how you acted when she was missing.","You have feelings for her, don't you?","Well, there might not be a relationship to worry about later.","I care about you, too.","My company ... it's over ...","I give up.","I brought you some tea.","I thought you might be cold out here.","Are you okay?","You seem out of sorts.","That's ridiculous.","No, she ''doesn't''.","The world ''does'' need you.","You're the Avatar.","Korra, you're forgetting about all the good that happened after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was.","The Equalist Movement lost its leader ''and'' its power.","Free elections were held in the United Republic and nonbenders ''finally'' had a voice.","People had hope again and it was all because of you.","But you became more powerful, too.","I mean ... you turned into a giant spirit.","And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing.","You brought back the airbenders ''and ''caused a positive shift in the world.","She is?","Right.","Everything you do is \"allegedly\".","Like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center!","Fine.","I'll help.","But don't even think about double-crossing me again.","If it works, it'll even the playing field.","Apparently on a giant mecha suit!","Let's go to my factory.","Maybe we can get a few of those hummingbird suits up and running.","We can't fight it, but maybe we can cripple it.","Zhu Li, when you were spying on Kuvira, did you learn anything about that metal monster?","What should we do?","Not all of them.","There are the prototypes back at my office.","If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support.","I can't stabilize it!","I thought you fixed the hydraulics.","Dad?","But the saws are way too big.","We'd never get the suits off the ground.","Like a metal mosquito.","Just a few more minutes.","If we stop that mecha giant, it will all be because of you.","I love you, Dad.","We need to get out of here.","We have to go now!","Dad!","Now!","Dad!","And so has Korra!","Excuse me Tenzin, Varrick is looking for you.","Something about wanting to borrow a glidersuit to fly off the tower?","For what?","Thank you.","I'm just glad I was able to forgive him.","I'm kind of all danced out.","Honestly, after

times.","This festival used to be a solemn time of fasting and meditation.","Now it's just a chance to watch some rube try to stick an entire arctic hen in his mouth.","Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in southern waters.","Some traditions have purpose.","I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that.","Apparently you haven't been given all of the information you need.","It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.","So you've said.","This is nothing.","When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits.","People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky.","And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits.","That is why I want so badly to teach you.","To help you fulfill your destiny.","Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn.","It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.","As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits.","But I am saddened to see what it has become: a cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.","I feel the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay.","Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters.","I only hope we are not too late to change course.","Go in peace.","As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways.","All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know.","The air temples will teach her nothing.","Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.","I know this was a hard decision, Korra, but it was the right one.","Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training.","I have great plans for you.","You're early.","I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits, I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training.","We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe, the South Pole.","We will do more than just train.","By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves, and now it threatens to destroy our tribe.","We must set things right.","The Southern Water Tribe depends on you.","Tonraq, what do you want?","Absolutely not.","You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done.","Because he's misguided.","The sad truth is, it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance.","He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since.","You will open an ancient spirit portal.","At the South Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the Spirit World, but it has long been closed.","There are no evil spirits, there is light and dark in them all.","But when they're unbalanced, the darkness takes over.","If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restored.","There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ends on the winter solstice.","That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together.","Only then can the Avatar open the portal.","Exactly, and we can't afford to wait another year.","You're right.","You should have told her a long time ago.","Yes.","There used to be lights at the South as well, but during the Hundred Year War, the South was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared.","When the War ended, the North helped to rebuild you ''physically'', as a nation, but we have not rebuilt you spiritually.","Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies.","Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm.","We ''must'' keep moving.","No!","The solstice is tonight.","And we're so close.","Let's open this portal and lead your father and the entire Southern Water Tribe in the right direction.","We don't have much time.","We've arrived.","It's just like the sacred forest Tonraq destroyed in the North.","You must find your way to the heart of the forest where the dormant spirit portal lies.","From here, you're on your own.","The Avatar must go alone.","You have to believe in yourself, like I believe in you.","What is it?","Korra, all the past Avatars live on inside of you.","Let them guide you.","Let them help you find the light in the dark.","Avatar Korra, you have taken the first step in bringing balance back to the South, and soon the whole world.","Opening the spirit portal was only the first step in getting the Southern Water Tribe back on its righteous path.","There's more difficult work to be done before our two tribes are ''truly'' united.","Now that you've opened the Southern portal, we need to protect it from the people who would do the spirits harm.","I need you for something more important.","There is another portal, in the North.","Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds.","The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North.","And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well.","The ''world'' will be united again.","Our next training sessions isn't until tomorrow.","Yes?","Your father has been talking to you.","I am their chief.","I'm uniting, not invading.","If the Water Tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides.","The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man.","That would be catastrophic.","We?","No, Korra.","This is a war only the Avatar can prevent.","As the Avatar, you must remain neutral in this conflict.","You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes finds unity.","Tenzin lacked faith in you.","But I have no doubt that you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.","Thank you for saving my life.","Find Varrick.","I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors.","You want them to go free?","Very well.","I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter.","Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial.","For conspiring to assassinate me.","I wish it hadn't come to this.","But your parents held meeting with the rebels, right here in their home.","Rest assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial.","He is the most fair and honorable man I know.","I'm sure you're right.","So we should have nothing to worry about.","I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked.","They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after Avatar Korra had saved me.","Korra, calm down.","I'll talk to him.","I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider.","Show these men and my brother mercy.","I'm sorry, Korra.","You'll never see your father again.","On a ship headed to the Northern Tribe.","He'll serve out his sentence there.","Remember who you are.","As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war.","You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity.","All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny.","If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South.","And even I will be powerless to stop them.","And why would I do that?","No, I don't.","You've served your purpose.","Leave them.","My brother's no threat to us up there.","Increase security around the spirit portal.","Keeping it safe is our number one priority.","I need you two to go after the Avatar.","She's the only one who can open the Northern spirit portal.","I told Korra what I thought she needed to hear.","I need her ''alive''.","Never mind that.","Where is the Avatar?","You didn't get her?","You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the Avatar.","You're right.","It was my fault for trusting you.","Harmonic Convergence is almost upon us.","This is my opportunity to change the world.","Good, because I'll need your help to open the northern portal.","I believe there is another way.","This way.","There it is, the northern portal.","By entering the Spirit World through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: our bending.","Join me!","Together, we can open this portal.","Leave him!","Keep bending!","This is more important!","The Avatar is dead, and we cannot open the Northern portal.","I have failed you, Vaatu.","How do you know?","I'll find her.","Leaving so soon?","When Wan Shi Tong told me he had a visitor, I had to see it with my own eyes.","I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself - what kind of a father is he?","Don't believe everything you read.","Why don't you come with me, so you can do some firsthand research?","If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal ''now''.","What will it be?","Open the portal- or lose your friend's soul forever?","You should've come through the portal.","Then you could do this!","Hello, Tonraq.","Looking for me?","Brother, I'm too strong for you.","Yes!","I did.","Stop!","He's mine.","I am.","And you will bow to me.","Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next.","You don't understand.","Everything I've achieved so far will pale in comparison with what I'm about to accomplish.","The Avatar will be here soon.","She has no choice ... Congratulations, everyone.","You've all got front row seats for the beginning of a new world order.","You think what Avatar Wan did was good?","Driving almost all the spirits from this world?","The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos.","You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds, but there shouldn't ''be'' a bridge: we should live together as one.","It's true that when Wan fused with Raava he tipped the scales in her favor, but this time I'll be here to level the playing field.","When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will fuse with Vaatu, and together we will become the new Avatar: a Dark Avatar.","Your era is over.","I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter.","The only difference is that while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power, I will be in complete alignment with mine.","Vaatu and I will be as one.","No one will be able to stand against us.","Keep them locked up.","After the Harmonic Convergence, I will come for Korra.","Don't let them

new airbenders going?","Oh, she's horrible.","She thinks she can just do whatever she wants.","What?","I mean, the idea of even having a queen is so outdated.","Don't you agree, Korra?","Well, you should start.","The world is evolving and the Earth Queen can evolve with it or step aside.","You want to talk about what's really bugging you?","Because ''I'm'' right here!","Varrick's heading up my new technology division.","Ease out, Lin.","Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past, but that doesn't mean he should pay for it for the rest of his life.","My chef was a pirate, but now he's a culinary master.","People change.","You know, before I built this city, there was nothing here.","I wanted to make my mark on the world.","It's complicated.","We didn't have a normal childhood.","Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police.","Because mom grew up in such a strict household, she gave us all the freedom in the world, hoping we'd figure out our own paths.","And in a way it was.","But we both ended up fighting for mom's attention.","Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop.","I was ... more of a rebel.","Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out.","When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the world.","I sailed the seas on a pirate ship, joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in a desert.","It took me a while, but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family.","So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband, and created a place I could truly call home.","Almost.","I've always wanted Lin to be a part of it, but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around.","I know she has a problem with me, but she had no right to yell at Opal last night.","All set for your power disc game, guys?","Really.","Lin never offered to train you?","Well, it's probably for the best.","I'm sure Lin would be a horrible teacher.","As the Avatar, you should have mastery over all the elements.","I'd be happy to show you the basics.","Okay, Earth Guy.","Well, let me know if you change your mind.","Wow, you almost look like a real cop!","Oh no, are you going to tell Mom?","It's not like she's going to care.","They're my friends and you have no right to call them that!","Come on guys, let's get out of here.","Get your hands off of me!","At least I have a life!","These meteorites are perfect for beginning metalbenders.","The metals have a unique property, making them easier to bend.","Here, try it!","Want to give it a shot?","Well, don't believe everything you hear.","The only thing limiting you is your attitude.","Try to focus on the fine pieces of earth within the metal.","Great job, Korra.","Leave them alone!","I didn't steal anything.","I just drove the car.","I owed my friends a favor.","It's not a big deal.","Oh, what are you going to do, Officer?","Arrest me?","This is all your fault!","What?!","Where am I supposed to go?","Congratulations.","You're the first metalbending Avatar.","Let's get started.","After thirty years, you're finally ready to talk?","Mom didn't throw her career away.","She retired the next year.","She was a hero.","Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past but- Lin, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out.","If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now.","I've been a different person for a long time.","You know what, Lin?","You're the one who hasn't changed.","You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself.","No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago.","Okay, I guess this is how it's going to be.","You've got it out of your system?","Opal has decided to go to the Northern Air Temple.","I guess you had something to do with her decision.","It's okay.","I'm glad she was honest with me.","I want her to do what makes her happy.","Mom gave us too much freedom, but I feel like I made the mistake of giving Opal too little.","I think it's about time I let her choose her own way.","I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time when we were younger.","I can't imagine what my life would've been like if Mom hadn't sent me away, if I had stayed in the city ... You're probably right.","Mako told me that you're an excellent police chief.","Republic City is lucky to have you.","I know Mom is proud.","Can we move on?","I'd love for you to be part of my life again.","There's plenty of space in the house, and the kids would love having their aunt around.","I do need a new co-director for my new dance performance.","Deal!","Everyone, if I could have your attention please?","Tonight, my beautiful little girl leaves for the Northern Air Temple.","Opal, none of us could be more proud of you.","You're an incredible daughter, sister, friend, and soon to be airbending master.","Here's to Opal.","May she help lead us into the new era!","I don't know, but we're not letting them escape!","We don't need to cross it.","Lin and I can drop in from the dome on cables.","She's a combustionbender.","If one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily.","You have to take her out right before we drop down.","If we get in trouble, metalbend us up.","They can't be far!","Guards, search the entire estate!","It is.","I don't know how this happened.","Obviously this was a well-planned operation, so don't blame me.","Question them all!","Whoever betrayed my city will suffer the consequences!","No, I'll gladly be questioned.","I have nothing to hide.","Suyin Beifong.","I'm the daughter of Toph and the only sister to Lin, and I had nothing to do with the attack last night.","How did they get in and out?","Where are they now?","You're a traitor to the entire clan!","Where's Aiwei?","What?","No!","I ... trusted him.","I trusted him with my life.","I thought we were family, but it was all a lie.","Enough!","Korra, listen to Lin.","Please.","Lin's only looking out for you.","I promise you, Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice.","I do.","Everyone should get some rest tonight.","I'll have my people prep your airship and you can leave first thing in the morning.","You really think Naga could track Aiwei?","Then, here.","There's a jeep packed with supplies on the east gate.","It's all gassed up and ready to go.","Because I want you to hunt down Aiwei and bring him back to me.","I said what Lin wanted to hear and I bought you guys some time.","Go.","I'll deal with Lin in the morning.","And good morning to you, Lin.","Now don't get mad, Korra's fine.","I'm just waiting to hear if she'd tracked down Aiwei yet.","Oh, don't be so overdramatic.","You can't control the Avatar's every move.","No one's answering.","What if Zaheer's already up there?","I should never have let Opal go.","I hope so.","I'll ready my airship.","With a full force of the Metal Clan security backing us, we can take them.","I say we make our approach from the west, drop down from the airship on cables, ambush these Red Lotus low-lives before they know what hit them.","You have a better idea on how to save the airbenders?","And give them the high ground?","No, if their lavabender spots us, he'll melt the mountainside and us with it.","And Opal is one of those airbenders.","Believe me, I understand what's at stake.","Yes, whatever you need, they're here.","I think I figured a way to play this so that the airbenders and Korra all come out in one piece.","Zaheer doesn't know how many of us there are, so we have the numbers advantage.","I say we split into two teams: Mako, Bolin and Asami will take the airship up to the temple.","Meanwhile, my metalbenders, Tonraq, Lin, and I will get in position below Laghima's Peak.","We're pinned down.","Lin.","No.","It's over, Zaheer.","This is your last warning!","I knew you had the potential for something big.","You just had to believe in yourself.","Apparently, he can fly now.","No, Kuvira.","Stay with the injured.","We'll be back for you once we have the Avatar.","Don't worry.","I'm not coming out without our children and the rest of your people.","Oh, honey, I'm so glad you're safe.","Hello, Baatar Jr.","I don't know if I'd call marching all over the Earth Kingdom, forcing people to bow to Kuvira, \"doing good\".","I'm just glad she'll be stepping down after tomorrow.","We need to talk.","I met with the world leaders, and I've come as their representative.","That's hardly fair.","I didn't want to seize power for myself, which is what you've done.","I'm telling you for the good of everyone, you have to step down.","What makes you so different?","You're just another tyrant.","And don't pretend the people put you where you are.","I know what happens to cities who don't want to hand over control to you.","Call whomever you want, but they'll never make it in time.","Kuvira's already here and she brought her entire army.","I'm not giving up Zaofu.","I don't care if you brought your entire army.","You must realize what you're doing goes against everything your father and I tried to teach you.","Don't say that!","Can't you see she's brainwashed you!","I can't believe you brought Bolin here to try and sway us.","''Leave!''","Zaofu will never accept you as their leader!","She was more than that.","She was like a daughter to me.","I took her in when she was eight years old and nourished her talents.","Kuvira was smart, a natural leader, and quickly rose through the ranks.","I saw myself in her.","Three years ago, after the fall of the Earth Queen, Raiko and Tenzin came to see me.","And you think ''I'' should be the one?","I'm honored that you thought of me, but I'm not interested in imposing my ideals on an entire nation.","I'm afraid I can't help you.","What would you have me do?","March into Ba Sing Se with an army?","We'd be seen as conquerors and greeted with nothing but war.","It's not going to happen.","I didn't realize it at the time, but that moment put a rift between us.","Kuvira turned my own son against me, and together they plotted behind my back.","What do you think you're doing?","No!","You will stay here!","''If'' you leave now, you will never be welcomed back.","Kuvira and Baatar left that day with Varrick, my security force, and a few of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens.","After Kuvira proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se, Raiko and the other world leaders made her the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom.","When she refused to step down, I knew it was only a matter of time before she made her way back here.","You can.","Go into the Avatar State and demolish her entire army.","Remove Kuvira from power once and for all.","Kuvira doesn't listen to reason.","Most of this army has been forced into service by Kuvira.","If we take her out, they'll have no reason to fight.","Tonight we end her reign of terror.","She's alone in there.","Now's our chance!","Zhu Li?","''Never!''","I'll never bow to you!","You have to go into the Avatar State!","''Do it!''","Opal, get out of here, we'll be fine!","Just go!","Sweetie, it'll be fine.","Lin won't drop you and Bolin will catch you.","Could be our best chance to stop Kuvira.","Watch out for Baatar Sr. and Huan.","Thanks for coming to save us, Mom.","We're coming with you.","Let me talk to him.","Baatar -- Why are you doing this?","I know you set out to help better the world, but this is madness!","But at what cost?","How many people have to lose their lives before Kuvira is satisfied?","I don't know what I did to hurt you, but whatever it was, I'm sorry.","When you left Zaofu, it broke my heart -- -- and our family has never been the same since.","Please, Baatar -- stop all this and come home.","We want you back with us.","Just rest, son.","I'm here.","I don't know, sweetie.","She's a complicated person.","Yeah, they might take some time to come around.","But we'll work through it as a family.","Are you sure?","When you fought Kuvira before ...","The outside may be platinum, but we can do a lot of damage in here.","You're going to answer for ''everything'' you've done."]},"Wei":{"combined_dialog":["Ha!","Wing goes down!","I wanna power disc your face.","You should go play with

everything we can to help.","I'm Opal, and this is Kai.","Unfortunately, the Air Nation is spread thin right now.","We're all you have.","Maybe they brought food and supplies!","If he's here, he must be with Kuvira and my brother.","This isn't going to be good.","Don't believe everything she says.","I missed you too.","Like you care.","She still hasn't forgiven you.","I guess when her son

do.","You're right.","We can save this town ourselves.","Every little bit helps.","Because of you and the other farmers around here, we have more than enough food to feed the town until we can get

mind, I would like to say a few words.","Growing up in Zaofu, with Suyin Beifong, I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic, and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward.","It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray.","It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages.","I'd like to make an announcement to the world: the Earth Kingdom is no more.","And from here on out, this man has no authority.","I have created a new Earth ''Empire'', and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for ''my'' people.","And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing: Anyone who crosses our borders or stands in our way, will be ''crushed.''","You look worried, Bolin.","You believe in the work that we've done for the people of the Earth Empire, right, Bolin?","Then stick with me.","I'm going to need your help now more than ever.","Raiko and the other leaders want to bully us into accepting some idiot king who will serve them but neglect the people.","We have to stand strong against them.","That was just some ... tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business.","Believe me, conflict is the last thing I want.","Will you help me make history, Bolin?","Thank you.","Can you give us the room, please?","So ''now'' you're taking an interest in world affairs.","A little late, isn't it?","When the queen fell, and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu, and let others deal with the consequences.","I stepped ''up''.","I provide stability and equality.","Tell your world leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business.","We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.","Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.","From now on, developing this technology is your number one priority.","Don't get ahead of yourself.","Securing your hometown won't be like every other city.","''No''.","The eyes of the world are on us now.","We must do this ''right''.","That's why we need Bolin.","Su trusts him.","She'll listen to him.","What happened?","Were we attacked?","No, you're ''not''.","Do you realize what we could do with this kind of power?","Well, I'm the other voice in your head, and I'm telling you you will continue with this project.","And now there's a voice in ''my'' head telling me to drop you on the tracks.","''Should I listen?''","No.","In fact, I have good news.","We want you to be a part of our inner circle.","It means you've proven your worth.","We're so close to uniting the Empire, but Su has some resentment towards me and Baatar that might cloud her judgment and stop her from making a wise decision.","We believe you can help her see clearly.","Good.","Because we're here.","The army is here to project strength.","You're here to present peace.","Su, I didn't bring my army to threaten you.","I wanted to show you all that your son and I have accomplished.","''Ha!''","I didn't ''brainwash'' him!","I

force.''","When people don't cooperate, we must find other ways of convincing them to join.","It's not for you to worry about.","Those people are my loyal subjects, and they contribute to the Empire however I see fit.","Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths.","I didn't know your personal feelings for Opal were stronger than your loyalty to me.","Zaofu ''will'' join us.","The only thing I'm second-guessing is my decision to bring you along.","Maybe you need to spend some time in a reeducation camp.","Your loyalty seems to be wavering.","Suyin, I know this isn't my place, but I think you should do this.","Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone.","There are already wars.","The Earth Queen nearly destroyed our nation.","This is our opportunity to change things.","We're doing what you don't have the guts to do: We're going to Ba Sing Se to help bring order back to the Earth Kingdom.","And who's going to stop me?","Your security force was more than happy to join my cause.","They're some of the best fighters in the world, and they are tired of being treated like exotic birds in your cage.","When I choose to return, it'll be on my own terms.","Korra, it's such an honor to see you again.","The last I heard, you were still healing in the South Pole.","That's wonderful news.","I think we both know that's not going to happen.","Look, I was tasked with bringing stability to the Earth Kingdom.","Zaofu is the last holdout.","Why should I treat it differently than any other state?","I understand you're just trying to do Su a favor, but you can't come to me as I am on the verge of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop.","The world was descending into chaos while you were gone.","In order to fix it, I had to make some tough decisions.","Exactly.","Korra, if you really want to help, go back to Su and ''try'' to talk some sense into her.","Let's call a temporary truce.","I won't make any moves until you talk to her and get back to me.","Send these three away on the next train.","Bolin and Zhu Li will be going to the reeducation camp for our most severe dissenters.","And ''you'' will continue work on the spirit-energy project, under close, ''armed'' supervision.","I want it weaponized immediately.","Why would I?","You two could learn something from her.","Rise, Zhu Li.","I'll give you another chance.","I knew you'd try a sneak attack.","You were afraid to step up and lead the Earth Kingdom when you had the chance.","You were afraid to join me when I became the leader, and now, you're afraid of a fair fight.","You've always been a coward.","Take them!","Attention citizens of Zaofu.","Your leader, Su Beifong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept, ignoring the terms of our truce.","Luckily, I now have her and her assault team in custody.","Rest assured that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, unless your remaining representatives meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full and unconditional surrender of your city.","That is all.","If Su agrees to bow to me and turn over Zaofu, she and the rest of your family will not be harmed.","I've already laid out my terms, and I think they're very reasonable.","After all, Su did try to take me out during our ''peaceful ''negotiations.","Bolin is with my fianc\u00e9, working on something very important.","But, I assure you, he's on board with my plans.","You two have been apart for some time.","I guess you don't realize how much Bolin has grown up.","Now ''turn over Zaofu''.","Avatar Korra, you are interfering with internal Earth Empire business, and letting your ''personal'' feelings get in the way of reason.","Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself.","They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long.","I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation.","This is about equality.","The ''only way'' you're going to keep me from marching into Zaofu is if you ''physically'' stop me.","Now what are you going to do?","Looks like the Avatar's a little off her game!","Come on, Avatar, get up!","Show me what you've got!","I knew you were weak.","You broke our agreement!","Attack!","Zaofu is ours!","Bring the citizens of Zaofu to kneel before the Great Uniter!","All who pledge their loyalty to me will keep their freedom and will be dealt with fairly as full citizens of the Earth Empire.","The rest will be imprisoned as traitors, like Su Beifong and her sons.","Now ''bow''!","Are you sure, there's no way they survived?","How would you like to help Baatar build the most powerful weapon the world has ever seen?","Begin dismantling the domes.","Perfect.","Harvest the vines until there's nothing left.","I just wanted to check in to make sure everything was on track.","It looks wonderful.","You've been working on this the entire time, Zhu Li.","What do you think the problem is?","But you're doing everything you can to fix those, correct?","Tell the troops and the factory workers to attend tomorrow's demonstration.","I want them all to witness this incredible new weapon in action.","Congratulations on all of your hard work.","This weapon is proof that the Earth Empire is the strongest nation in the world.","And believe me, this is only the beginning!","Fire the weapon.","What's wrong?","And this could cause the entire weapon to fail?","What do you know about this?","You swore your loyalty to me and I gave you a chance at greatness.","This is how you repay me?!","Chain her up in the target town.","She can see how the weapon works up close and personal.","The prison.","Get there now!","I didn't come all this way to stop now.","Fire when ready.","I want to see that town destroyed.","Today, we stand on the precipice of history.","For the past three years, we've fought side by side to unite the Earth Empire and we've proven that no one can stand in our way, not even the Avatar.","But our mission is not yet complete.","There is a grave injustice that must be corrected.","As you all know, after the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang, along with Fire Lord Zuko, stole Earth Empire land and formed the United Republic.","This land belongs to the people of the Earth Empire and it's time to take it back!","Republic City will be ours!","Are you ready to show the world what a true superpower looks like?","I never could have done this without your help.","After we claim victory, we can finally get married and rule our empire together.","The Avatar.","You're in no position to give orders.","I don't think you understand the power I possess.","Let me make it clear.","You have three seconds before I wipe out your army.","Time's up!","Good.","Turn your army and the Avatar over to me, and give Baatar your location.","He'll present you with our terms.","What do you mean, \"he didn't show\"?","If he's not on the airship, then where is he?","Are you injured?","Is the Avatar there with you now?","Find out where that signal's coming from.","I see them.","Clear the glass!","What was that?","Locate the source of the pulse.","That must be where Varrick is.","Third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep.","Capture anyone left in the city.","Mech platoons, report.","That's the place.","I need more power!","They're cutting in!","More power!","Initiate lockdown!","Find the Avatar and whoever else is with her.","Never.","If you really want to end it, then come and get me!","''Now'' it's over.","I can't!","What happened?","Are we ... dead?","Why would you save my life, after everything I did to you?","We are nothing alike!","This wasn't how I wanted things to end.","If you would have all just surrendered, none of this would have happened.","I was trying to ''help'' my people.","Su turned her back on the Earth Kingdom, you were ''gone''!","I had to do something.","You don't understand anything about me.","''Don't pretend you know what it felt like!","The Avatar is adored by millions!","I was cast aside by ''my own parents'' like I meant nothing to them.","How could I just stand by and watch the same thing happen to my nation, when it needed someone to guide it?","Stand down.","This battle is over.","I owe the Avatar my life.","Her power is beyond anything I could ever hope to achieve.","I'll accept whatever punishment the world sees fit.","And Su, I'm sorry for all the anguish I've caused you and your family."]},"Zhu Guan":{"combined_dialog":["My name is Zhu Guan."]},"Second
