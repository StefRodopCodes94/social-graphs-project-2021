{"Tenzin":{"combined_dialog":["Earth.","Fire.","Air.","Water.","When I was a boy, my father, Avatar Aang, told me the story of how he and his friends heroically ended the Hundred Year War.","Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko transformed the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations, a society where benders and nonbenders from all over the world could live and thrive together in peace and harmony.","They named the capital of this great land, Republic City.","Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things in his life.","But sadly, his time in this world came to an end.","And like the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the Avatar began anew.","That's your grandmother, Meelo.","Pema, let me help you.","Careful now, careful.","Mother, ''please''.","Yes, well ...","I'm afraid not.","We're only visiting for the night.","Then I have to return to Republic City.","I'm sorry, Korra.","Your airbending training is going to have to wait.","It could be much longer.","I have a responsibility to Republic City.","I am one of its leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now.","I wish there were another way.","I know this is difficult to accept, but it's not the right time for you to come to the city.","Oogi, yip-yip!","You blatantly disobeyed my wishes and the orders of the White Lotus.","Don't bring my mother into this!","You ... ah ...","Wait.","I have done my best to guide Republic City toward the dream my father had for it, but you're right.","It has fallen out of balance since he passed.","I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy, but you ''are'' his legacy.","You may stay and train airbending here with me.","Republic City needs its Avatar once again.","Earth.","Fire.","Air.","Water.","Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.","That sport is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending.","Yes.","In order to learn airbending I believe you require a calm, quiet environment, free from any distractions.","So, my mother informed me that you've never been able to airbend before.","That's perfectly all right.","You just need to be patient.","Often the element that's the most difficult for the Avatar to master is the one most opposite to the Avatar's personality.","For Aang, it was earthbending.","Let's begin your first lesson.","A time-honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of airbending.","Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise?","The key is to be like the leaf.","Flow with the movement of the gates.","Jinora will demonstrate.","Airbending is all about spiral movements.","When you meet resistance, you must be able to switch direction at a moment's notice.","Korra, come down here please.","I thought I made myself clear.","I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.","I know you're frustrated, but these teachings will sink in over time.","Then one day, they'll just click.","Korra, the meditation's not over yet!","No.","Patience, Korra!","Pardon me, everyone, have you seen Korra this evening?","She's not in her room.","I'll get her myself!","Once again, you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders.","You were to stay on the island!","Let's go.","What?","That is a ''ludicrous'' suggestion!","The Avatar needs to learn airbending!","It is ''not'' optional!","Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra!","When will you learn that?","How about that?","Woohoo!","I think I owe you an apology too.","I was trying to teach you about patience, but I lost mine.","Of course not.","By the way, you were really good out there tonight.","You moved ''just'' like an airbender!","I did.","Pro-bending turned out to be the ''perfect'' teaching tool for you.","That's ... that's impossible.","Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability.","Absolutely not.","A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and nonbenders.","This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power, isn't it?","This.. is a completely different situation ... and how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!","We are grateful for this delicious food, for happiness, for compassion, and ...","This is my home, Tarrlok.","We're about to eat dinner.","I suppose.","Enough with the flattery, Tarrlok.","What do you want from Korra?","Me, too.","Korra gave you her answer.","It's time for you to go.","I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more and more extravagant.","Korra, are you ... doing all right?","Why don't you take a break?","I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok, but I just want to make sure your decision was for the right reason.","Right, that's what you said.","You know, it's okay to be scared.","The whole city is frightened by what's been going on.","The important thing is to talk about our fears, because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance.","I'm always here for you, if you want to talk.","I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting, but keep your guard up.","It's not like him to throw a party just for the fun of it.","Meelo!","No, that's not a toilet!","Oh dear.","Korra, this is madness.","This is all your doing!","Korra!","Korra, are you all right?","What happened?","Was Amon here?","Did he ... did he take your bending away?","Ah, thank goodness.","It's all right, the nightmare is over.","Admitting your fears is the first and most difficult step in overcoming them.","I know winning the championship means a lot to you.","But as far as I'm concerned, we need to shut the arena down.","The council is unanimous.","We're closing the arena.","We must prevent the conflict between benders and nonbenders from escalating into all-out war!","The council is not changing its position, Lin.","A word please, Lin.","Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want to see you get hurt.","In that case, I'm going to be by your side during the match.","It's for Korra.","I want to make sure she's safe.","I've known Lin since we were children, she's always been ... challenging.","My father and Lin got along famously.","I'm afraid her issues ... are with me.","What!","How-?","Where'd you get that idea?","Criminy!","I'll have to have a word with her.","Oh, she tried.","Anyway, Pema didn't ''steal'' me, Lin and I had been growing apart for some time.","We both had different goals in li- Why am I even telling you this?","It all happened a long time ago and we've moved passed it.","What do you ... Of course she has!","Anyway, this is none of your business!","How is the security sweep going?","They've checked underneath the stands?","And you have enough officers to cover all points of entry?","Lin, with so much on the line it would be nice if we could help each other out, at least for one night.","Like old times.","I would appreciate that.","Oh come on, refs!","There was some funny business in that last play!","I've been brushing up.","That Wolfbat blatantly bent a disk outside of his zone.","Reminds me of someone else I knew at that age.","You two might get along if you would only give her a chance.","Oh, come on!","Those were illegal head shots!","Open your eyes, ref!","Look out!","He played us all.","Republic City is at war.","We're ready for you now.","So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists then framed Cabbage Corp?","That's right.","Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion.","A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break in.","It was tragic.","It's possible that he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.","In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?","We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.","Raiding the Sato Mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck.","If we're wrong ... Where is your father?","Hiroshi was lying all right, but where is he?","Korra!","No!","You can't give up like this!","Good day, ladies.","Asami, welcome to the island.","Beifong's replacement, Saikhan, is going to be inducted as the new Chief of Police later.","I think we should both be there.","No you're not.","You just need to work through this airbending block.","I wasn't finished yet.","You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers, but also his past lives to call upon for guidance.","Have you ever made contact with your past lives?","You may have made a connection without realizing it.","Perhaps something you mistook as a dream?","And did you see any previous Avatars in these visions?","Hmm, I don't know.","But I urge you to meditate on these visions.","I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.","This is going too far, Tarrlok!","You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few!","I came as fast as I could.","Are your friends all right?","I'll take care of this.","Saikhan, a word please.","No, it cannot.","Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight.","I'd like you to release them immediately.","Those people are entitled to due process under the law.","Oh, I plan to.","At the council meeting, first thing in the morning.","Calm down, Korra.","I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient.","But you really ''are'' the worst!","''Ever!''","Councilman Tenzin here.","What?!","What happened?","What was Korra doing at City Hall?","I urge you to meditate on these visions.","I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something.","I've been on the phone all morning, but nothing yet.","I'm afraid her polar bear dog is missing as well.","Let's bring them all home, Lin.","That's where they must be keeping Korra.","Because ''he'' has Korra.","He fooled us all!","Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice.","But there were no chi blockers here last night.","You planted the evidence, didn't you?","Don't make this worse for yourself.","Tell us where you have Korra.","It could lead us to Korra!","Let's go.","Korra!","Oh, thank goodness.","Yes, she's fine, sweetie.","I'm sorry you were scared, but everything is going to be fine now.","I promise.","Korra, I realize you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened.","But how did you escape?","And where's Tarrlok?","What?","This is very disturbing news.","Amon is becoming emboldened.","Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar ...","I fear Amon is entering his endgame.","Will you stay here and watch over Pema and the children while I meet with the council?","With everything that has happened lately, I want to be sure my family is in safe hands.","Pema!","Ye- yes- yes, Lin has agreed to help out around here and keep an eye on things while I'm away.","Thank you, Lin!","Oogi, yip yip.","The other council members.","Are they all right?","This can't be happening.","Chief Saikhan.","I'm the only Council member left.","What's the status?","The general of the United Forces.","Saikhan, the vents.","We need to evacuate immediately.","Everyone stay close to me.","Not these mecha tanks again!","Saikhan, no!","Thank you.","I'm fine.","Thank you, kids.","Another moment later and I would have been on my way to Amon.","Oh no.","Oh, thank goodness you're all right!","You let them fight?","Do you realize what could have happened?","Pema!","I'm here, Pema.","Hello.","Come, meet your new brother.","Rohan.","I need to protect my family, and get them as far away from this conflict as possible.","If Amon got his hands on my children ...","I hate to even think of it.","But- Thank you, Lin.","Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being.","I'm not asking you to.","I sent word to the United Forces.","They will be here soon.","And once my family is safe, I will return.","With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war.","You're learning well.","Stay safe, Korra.","Oogi, yip yip!","Faster, Oogi!","Lin, what are you doing?!","Yes, she is.","In prison.","I don't know.","Let's go get your mother and the baby.","You saved Republic City.","Great, now I have to entertain my brother.","It's going to be all right Korra.","We need to be patient with her.","It will take time for her to accept what has happened.","I am so proud of you, ''Avatar'' Korra.","You did what!?","The Avatar State is not to be used as a booster rocket!","You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate!","Clearly you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections, not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending.","Is it too late for you to unretire from the United Forces?","You've mastered Korra style airbending, now you need to master real airbending.","Hopefully our visit to all the air temples will give you the inspiration you need to look more deeply into your studies.","No one's fighting!","We're going to have a wonderful time!","Now that the president is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs.","You're not invited.","I'm not sensitive!","Spirit, why are you angry with us?","What have we done to offend you?","Are you all right?","Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable, but Korra still has much to learn about airbending.","And I hope that going to the air temples will help her connect with the past Avatars.","Korra, please listen.","Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together.","It has been a pleasure serving you, Avatar Korra.","Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now.","All right, hop on!","I love you, Mom.","We'll see you soon!","There it is, the Southern Air Temple.","Isn't it magnificent?","Good to see you again, Abbot Shung.","No thank you, I'm fine.","Oh.","Okay?","That's right, Jinora, the most sacred place in the entire Southern Air Temple.","Here, you will find statues of ''every'' Avatar who ever lived.","Where are your brother and sister?","Meelo!","Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since- Aaand, it's over.","Yes, he has.","It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family.","Isn't that right, my little Rohan?","And I've really enjoyed having you two around.","Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad.","No, that can't be right.","What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant koi?","Hmm.","Oh, remember Ember Island?","Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach.","I could've sworn.","It's all right, dear, Ikki couldn't have gone far., I'll find her.","Sure, I could use the help.","Ikki!","Ikki!","Ikki?","Ikki, where are you?","Why would Ikki run off like this?","Ah, it's probably my fault.","Excuse me?","Kya, you're right.","I haven't been spending enough time with them.","I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.","Dad was under a lot of pressure.","Dad loved us all ''equally''.","Besides, it all happened a long time ago.","Why are we even talking about this?","We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark.","Uch.","Here we go.","And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki?","I'm sick of your far-fetched tales.","''Three'' typhoons?","Come on!","At least fifty times faster, by my calculations.","If you need an airlift down, just say the word.","Bumi!","Kya's right.","You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest.","''I'' had to become the responsible one.","Sure, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself.","It was time for you to settle down somewhere.","You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire ''culture'' on your shoulders.","Oh, so ''that's'' what this is all about.","Who else is going to do it?","Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place.","I can't be around you two right now.","Go back to the temple and see if Ikki returned.","I'll keep looking out here.","Fine.","Ikki!","Ikki, where are you?","Shoo!","Go bother someone else.","You two are worse than Kya and Bumi.","Ikki!","Oh, thank goodness.","Actually, is there room for one more?","Nice to meet you, Blueberry Spicehead.","New ones, huh?","Can they be ''my'' new brothers and sisters too?","You like that, don't you, Blueberry Spicehead?","Yes, you do.","You know, I could get used to it here.","No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional.","Let's not.","They'll only spoil our good mood.","But what about Meelo?","He's hilarious too, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth.","And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle.","I couldn't agree with you more.","That's very wise of you, Ikki.","I suppose.","We can't hide in this cave forever.","Yes, I'd like that.","I wanted to apologize for how I acted yesterday.","I've worked so hard to celebrate Dad's legacy that I may have overlooked the parts of him that were less than ideal.","That's one happy family.","No, no, you can't just demonstrate it.","That never works.","Ugh, classic over-rewarding.","Command respect.","Having some trouble, son?","Believe me, I know the feeling.","Maybe I can help.","How would you like your old dad to teach you how to be a master trainer?","All right, Meelo, the first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish ''dominance''.","You are in charge.","Never forget that.","Now call Poki.","Meelo ... you're rewarding him for bad behavior.","You can't let him nap in the bed with you.","You are the alpha lemur.","He has to sleep on the floor.","I know it's hard, but it's for the best.","I know.","Well done, Meelo!","I knew you could learn to train Poki.","I've created a monster.","Uh, maybe we should forget about all this training discipline for now.","Why don't you and Poki just have fun and play?","Jinora, there you are.","Come on, everyone's waiting.","Were you playing with someone?","All right, who's ready for an exciting tour of the Eastern Air Temple?","We've got a lot to see today, including ancient statues, ancient gardens, and the meditation hall used by ancient airbenders.","Korra?","See?","This is why schedules are important.","It's great to see you too, but why aren't you training at the South Pole?","What?","No.","We've been out of touch with the outside world since we started our vacation.","Just tell us everything!","I knew this would happen.","So Avatar Wan imprisoned this dark spirit Vaatu in the Spirit World?","I knew Unalaq was hungry for power, but never realized how far he would go to get it.","No, don't blame yourself.","This is Unalaq's doing.","Now, we must focus on setting things right before he can do any more damage.","So, you need to close the Southern portal, but if Unalaq's army controls the South, how are we going to get to it?","A journey to the Spirit World.","All my years of spiritual training have prepared me for this moment.","I will help you.","Today, we enter the Spirit World.","You're lucky.","This temple is the most spiritual of all the air temples.","Why, this very garden is where my father met Guru Pathik.","I would be if Meelo could ring his bell at the appropriate intervals.","Kya, this is too much smoke.","You set it up wrong.","This isn't going to work.","Well, the moment's ruined.","Focus, Korra.","Focus.","No talking.","Feel the energy of the universe.","Korra, really!","I'm trying to concentrate here!","I don't think this location is going to work either.","Well, nothing is feeling right to me.","Well ... actually, I've never been into the Spirit World.","''Trying'' to get in.","It never happened.","It's my greatest shortcoming as an airbender, spiritual leader, and son of Aang.","I've spent years studying the techniques and theories of ancient spiritual leaders.","Now that the Avatar needs me, it must be my time.","You have to trust me.","I can help you.","Jinora?","She's too young and untrained to have any knowledge about spiritual matters.","And how would you know that?","How did you do that?","How long have you been able to do this?","I don't know.","The spiritual energy is historically strongest ''near'' the temple.","The resemblance is uncanny.","Are you sure these spirits are leading us into the right place?","This is an ancient airbender meditation circle.","We'll have to perform a spiritual cleansing ceremony.","Dad taught it to me.","This site has been neglected for many years.","A cleansing ceremony will help strengthen its connections to the Spirit World.","It's working.","What are we supposed to do?","Your spiritual training has come a long way.","He taught you how to transform dark spirits.","I can't even get you into the Spirit World.","I won't let you down.","The ancient airbenders must have built this site.","If we meditate here, we'll be able to enter the Spirit World.","After all these years, my father's dreams for me will finally come true.","No!","Just give me some time.","Jinora will ''not'' enter the Spirit World!","She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but ''I am''.","I've spent ''years'' training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the Spirit World.","If everyone could just be quiet and let me ''focus''.","Perhaps I will never have the connections with spirits like I always wanted ... like my father wanted me to have.","I'm proud of you.","Go.","Close the portal.","We'll wait here and keep your bodies safe till you return.","I can't believe my little girl had to guide Korra into the Spirit World instead of me.","If anything happens to her I won't be able to forgive myself.","They won't have their bending in there.","They'll be defenseless!","Of course you aren't, because ''you'' have your ... um ... Why don't you two get some sleep.","I'll take the first watch.","I know you are.","Thank you.","Please come back soon.","Korra!","What was it like?","Did you manage to close the portal?","Was Jinora able to help you?","Where's Jinora?","W-Why isn't she waking up?","Korra!","What happened to my little girl?","Her spirit is trapped in the Spirit World, but she's going to be all right.","Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us.","There are lives on the line!","And my daughter is one of them!","Raiko, you must reconsider!","Korra, we don't have much time.","We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.","Unalaq will be waiting for you.","You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him.","As soon as we reach the Southern Water Tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main portal.","Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the Spirit World.","I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter.","Really?","And what do you suggest?","I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now!","This is serious!","Where is my mother?","Her soul is trapped in the Spirit World.","How much longer can she survive like this?","Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.","Enough of your ridiculous lies!","Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?!","Let's circle around and see if we can find a way in from the other side.","Hold on!","The spirits are weighting Oogi down!","We're losing altitude!","I failed in every way.","We've lost Jinora forever.","Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?","C'mon!","Ah, this isn't working.","We can't just randomly wander the Spirit World, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her.","Enough!","We can't do this by ourselves.","We need a spirit guide.","There.","Spirit, hello.","I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance.","We're completely lost.","We're walking in circles, I've seen that same spirit mushroom five times.","See?","Even it knows we're lost.","How ...?","Where ...?","It's been so long.","How did you know we were here?","Iroh, we are grateful, but we're not looking for the way out.","We're looking for my daughter.","I'm not leaving until I find Jinora.","A place where only the lost can find you ...?","That's it!","I know where to find Jinora!","Trust me.","Hey you!","Spirit!","Wake up!","This is a prison.","The Fog of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans.","I read about that in ancient text.","The fog is actually a spirit that infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories.","Ah, no!","Get off me!","If we stay together, we'll find Jinora and make it out of this fog.","Jinora!","Jinora!","What, do you hear something?","Bumi, you must focus your mind.","Right now!","There are no cannibals.","Kya, we're your brothers.","You must remember, before the fog infects you.","No!","Bumi!","Kya!","Come back!","You must stay focused.","Remember who you are Tenzin.","You are the son of Avatar Aang.","You are the hope for future generations of airbenders.","The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.","But what if I fail?","Then your father's hopes of the future dies with you.","I can't fail.","You will.","Ah, stop it!","I am the son of Avatar Aang.","I am the hope for future generations of airbenders.","I am the son of Avatar Aang.","Dad, I've failed you.","I am no spiritual leader, and I've let the world down.","I'll never be the man you were.","I am not a reflection of my father.","I am Tenzin.","I am Tenzin!","Jinora!","You'll be okay sweetie.","I'm here.","You were trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls.","And I wasn't going to let you stay there.","What are you talking about?","How do you know?","Jinora, wait!","Thank goodness you're all okay.","Were you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?","If that's true, then- The other Avatars may not be able to help you anymore, but, perhaps I can.","I know I haven't been the best mentor to you.","But I realized it was because I had a lot of spiritual growth to do myself.","There may still be a way for you to stop Vaatu.","Let go of your attachment to who you think you are, and connect with your inner spirit.","I'm not talking about Raava.","Raava is not who you are.","Come with me, I need to show you something.","Because this tree had a history long before it held Vaatu.","This is the Tree of Time.","And the legends say its roots bind the spirit and physical worlds together.","Yes.","I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe.","The Tree of Time remembers all.","Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit.","You have always been strong, unyielding, fearless.","Before he fused with Raava, Wan was just a regular person.","That's right.","He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was.","He wasn't defined by Raava anymore than you are.","You have to help them, Korra.","Do as the ancients once did.","Connect to the cosmic energy of the universe.","Don't bend the elements, but the energy within yourself.","I have no doubt.","I'm proud of you.","The Avatar Spirit has returned.","You were amazing.","Now that you're bonded with Raava once again, are you also reconnected with your past lives?","I see.","Why don't you close the portals, and we'll go home.","What do you mean?","I think you should trust your instincts.","There is nothing else I can teach you.","You are the Avatar.","Whatever your decision, I support you.","I'm sure you'll find a way.","What is it?","What's wrong?","Hilarious.","Time for dinner, everyone.","Stop waving your arms around at the table.","It's not funny anymore.","No one is bending giant boulders!","''Unbelievable''.","You're actually an airbender.","I suppose it's ''possible''.","Lin, you won't believe this.","Bumi just started airbending.","You mean there's another one?","Where is he now?","It's like a dream, Dad.","After a hundred and seventy years, new airbenders.","Well, in a way, all airbenders are our family.","Of course not.","But we might have to get used to not being the ''only'' airbenders around anymore.","But maybe, there will be enough to fill the temples again.","I just wish your grandfather was here to see this.","No, but I think the new airbenders will need lots of help and guidance to understand what it means to be part of our nation.","That's a big responsibility.","I know you will.","You must be at the end of your rope.","You hate meditating.","You didn't ''ruin'' anything.","You did what you thought was best for the world, and now things have changed.","Change can be good or bad, depending on your point of view.","You're not the President, Korra.","Your job isn't to fix the daily problems of every person in Republic City.","Your responsibility is to bring balance to the entire world, and that means no matter what you do, some people are not going to be happy about it.","On the other hand, some people will be very happy.","Like me.","What you did during Harmonic Convergence may have brought back the Air Nation, and that can only be good for restoring balance.","That is the act of a great Avatar.","True wisdom begins when we accept things as they are.","You've started a new age, Korra.","There's no going back to the past.","It is absolutely my pleasure to meet you, Daw.","I have never met a new airbender before.","Well, at least not one whose diaper I didn't have to change.","Don't think I'm not going with you.","It's so exciting.","Who knows who's out there now, discovering the gift of airbending for the first time?","I'll miss you too.","Once we find the airbenders, I'll send word.","You can join us at the Northern Air Temple then.","Go easy on them, son.","And it's all because of you, Korra.","I hate to get down to business, but is the airbender here now?","I just want to say it's an honor to meet a fellow airbender.","Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now.","Harmonic Convergence changed everything.","You represent the future of a culture that is being reborn.","You're going to help us rebuild the Air Nation.","But you must come with us to the Northern Air Temple.","Of course you can come.","This is of the utmost importance.","Your wife will understand.","Sir, you must understand, you're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about, skills you must master.","No, we can't coerce people, or throw them in potato sacks.","They must come freely.","But not to worry, there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation is all about.","When your son becomes a master, he'll have tattoos all over his body, just like me.","There's nothing more nutritious than our vegetarian diet.","I can tell that you're going to love wearing our ancient airbender robes.","They're very breathable.","You'll never have to worry about your worldly possessions again, because you won't have any.","You'll get to shave your head.","Your best friend will be a giant bison!","Ugh, I really thought I had that last guy.","Who doesn't want a bison as their best friend?","Well, I guess we should just go to Ba Sing Se and try our luck there.","I'm willing to try anything at this point.","Hang on a second Kai, where are your parents?","We can't have you come with us without their permission.","I'm so sorry about your parents.","I know we could never replace them ... but we are here for you.","Do you really want our first member of the Air Nation to be a liar and a thief?","Yes, you can release the boy into our custody.","Jinora, we're leaving now.","I've never met her, but I've heard she can be quite ... demanding.","Kai?","He is just a little boy, and he's our responsibility.","Besides, he's the only airbender we've recruited so far, we can't lose him.","I can't believe the Earth Queen is conscripting airbenders.","You can still do that?!","If anything goes wrong, come back immediately.","They're not down there?!","There are just too many places.","There has to be another way to locate them.","What do you mean \"a connection\"?","We have to get into that compound tonight and get those airbenders out.","nan Lin?","What are you doing here?","How is that possible?","No ...","Shortly after we found out you were the Avatar, Zaheer and three others attempted to kidnap you.","Luckily, your father, Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka and I were there to stop them.","We apprehended the criminals and locked them away in prisons designed to impair their abilities.","It was for your own safety.","Bumi and Korra, come with me to find the airbenders.","You three, find Kai.","We'll meet on the surface shortly.","Radio us if anything goes wrong.","Everyone, please!","You must stay calm and quiet if we want this to work.","We're going to get you away from the Earth Queen and out of the city.","We're already taking care of it.","Oogi!","I know that none of you chose to become airbenders.","But now you do have a choice.","We can relocate you somewhere safe, or you can come with me to the Northern Air Temple, to live in peace and train as Air Nomads.","You are no longer anyone's property.","What path you decide is up to you.","Be careful out there.","Stay safe.","But you made some new friends too.","You did well, Korra.","His pupils pleaded with their master to eat something, but he refused, just like he had each day during summer.","Instead he meditated and got his nourishment from the universe.","So when Tang Xu completed the ninety-seventh day of his historic fast on which island?","Anyone besides Otaku, who already studied this in his acolyte training?","And is answering every question.","That is correct.","Again.","Now, on day ninety-eight ... Only after many years of practice and intense training.","Besides, we don't have enough bison here for all of you.","Actually, the plural of bison is bison.","No, that's a wild herd.","It would take many years to tame them.","Now, let's get back to our lessons.","Okay, everyone is dismissed.","We'll pick this up ... tomorrow.","How is everything in the city?","What!","Is everyone all right?","Guru Laghima?","Yes ...","I remember.","Are you all right?","Where are you?","Lin willingly took you to her sister?","Really?","That's wonderful!","Not so well, I'm afraid.","No one seems to be interested in the hard work of becoming part of the Air Nation.","Bumi?!","He's my worst student.","That actually sounds like a good plan.","You're turning into a pretty wise Avatar after all.","Bumi, can I talk to you?","Actually, I need your help.","I don't think I'm doing well with the new airbenders, and everyone knows you're a natural leader.","What would you do if you were in charge?","Help me be more like you.","Thanks for the insight.","Dawn patrol!","Everyone up!","I'm taking your advice.","I'm going to break you down and build you back up!","Now get moving recruit!","Nothing like a ten-mile hike first thing in the morning.","No!","Of course not.","Then, this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique.","Airbenders are able to warm themselves only with their breathing.","Everyone get into the lotus position.","Ah, this is so much more refreshing than sleeping.","Hush!","Meditation time.","Focus.","Now that we're refreshed and loose from our hike and meditation, it's time for a balancing exercise.","The key is to maintain your heaven and earth connection.","Now you try.","Back up your posts!","It's not hard if you concentrate.","Get back up!","What's the matter, you can't handle it, soldier?","Don't worry, they can take it.","You'll see.","Ignore the lemurs digging in your ears.","Concentrate on your breathing and, you won't even know they're there!","When the head is shaved, an airbender is able to feel the wind around him.","It is both humbling and freeing.","All right, who's next?","That's fine, shaving your head is a personal choice.","Anyone else?","Fine!","Then we can get to our next training exercise: obstacle course.","Jinora, I have this under control Concentrate!","Remember, airbenders move like the wind.","Stay light on your feet, and you'll never feel the stinging rash cactus.","Everyone is waiting for you, Bumi.","If you don't make it over the next thirty seconds, they'll ''all'' have to run through the course again!","Get back up the wall, recruit!","You're letting your fellow airbenders down.","Fine, quit!","We don't need your attitude in the new Air Nation.","Go home?","You just got here.","I'm tired of all this complaining!","Jinora, take over!","Yes, just lead them through some basic exercises.","What brought this on?","Kai!","What does he know about when you should get tattoos?","The answer is \"no\"!","You're just a little girl.","Ikki, Meelo, you're up.","Just lead them through the Bagua circle.","Tattoos.","How could she think?","Focus.","Breathe.","Bumi ruins everything.","Inhale.","Focus.","I've failed.","Bumi quit, the rest of the airbenders want to go home.","Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?","Tell me about it.","It's actually better for your back.","Sorry.","Now I know how Korra feels when I'm talking to her.","Thank you, Pema.","Bumi, I want to apologize for losing my patience.","What?","Her boyfriend?","Kai!","What's going on down there?","I'm coming Jinora.","Kai, that's enough!","An airbender never attacks a defenseless opponent.","But that was very good technique.","I'm proud of you.","Your connection with the spirits, natural leadership, you remind me of Dad.","You are now.","The bison are the original airbenders.","They recognize their own kind.","I'm just lucky no one's hurt.","But I also realized that perhaps I was too harsh on you.","It's hard for me to believe that my little girl is grown up enough to have her tattoos.","I'll promise I'll think about it.","Fair enough?","I guess everyone is growing up.","Hello?","This is Tenzin.","Oh no.","It's too late.","He's here.","We need to get everyone out of here.","Stay close to me.","It's Zaheer.","Round everyone up!","We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately!","What is it you want from us?","Then what are you doing here?","You're using us as leverage.","I will never let you get to Korra.","Yes, I do.","Jinora!","Get everyone out of here.","Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off!","And stay out of her line of sight!","Go, ''go''!","As long as I'm breathing, it's not over.","I don't know.","Zaheer moved them out of the temple.","Gone.","All the bison got scared off during the attack.","But, I think I know another way out.","Bolin, can you get us to that wall?","Through there.","Incredible.","Kai.","You're all right.","Did Zaheer get away with Korra?","What?","I've heard the legends about Guru Laghima's ability to fly.","I'd never imagine they were true.","And find the airbenders.","Where are they?","How did you find them?","Oogi!","I'm glad to see you too, old friend.","Find the airbenders, and my family.","Oh, thank goodness you're all right.","I'll be fine.","He's unlocked powers of airbending that haven't existed for thousands of years.","You're looking stronger everyday, Korra.","She'll be fine.","She just needs time to heal.","The poison took a great toll.","Jinora, come forward.","Today, we welcome the first airbending master in a generation.","And I couldn't be more proud of my daughter.","When the existence of our people was threatened, when the Avatar's life hung in the balance, Jinora never gave up hope.","Thanks to her leadership, I see a very bright future for the Air Nation.","Of course, there would be no Air Nation without Avatar Korra: she opened the portals and somehow the world began anew for us.","And she was even willing to lay down her own life in order to protect ours.","There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done.","But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice.","So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the earth.","But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord to restore balance and peace.","Avatar Korra, I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the world.","Now, let us anoint the master who will help lead us in our new path.","After your coronation, the United Forces will escort you to Ba Sing Se.","Well, the roving bandits have ''mostly'' been dispersed.","No, we thought she was coming with you.","I assure you, your daughter is not here.","Now, I don't want you to worry about a thing while you're gone.","Your recovery should be your number one concern.","Jinora, the airbenders, and I have everything under control.","How have you been, Korra?","You look great!","All right!","The sparring match is over!","There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery.","Being the Avatar can wait.","The situation has been stabilizing since Kuvira took charge.","I know you want to help.","But trust me, everyone has this under control.","I just think you need to ... Nooo ...","I was going to say, you need to ... not worry about the future.","Be grateful for where you are now and the progress you've made.","I see the prince is becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership.","Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the world on the lookout for her.","I hope they find her soon.","I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military.","They say she's throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps.","Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here.","This ... is a mission of the utmost importance.","Conflict is coming to the Earth Kingdom and we ''need'' to find the Avatar.","Can I count on you three to bring Korra home?","Raiko asked me to stay here and help figure out a diplomatic solution to this Kuvira problem.","We're you able to get a read on Korra yet?","Good luck!","And be careful!","Remember, Jinora's in charge!","Meelo ... You're the perfect person to take charge.","The world leaders trust you, and, as a Beifong, you have credibility in the Earth Kingdom.","Well done kids!","I'm proud of you all for finding Korra.","No.","Welcome home.","Now, I hate to get right down to business, but I want to hear what happened in Zaofu.","No one expected you to handle Kuvira on your own.","It's up to all of us to find a way to deal with her.","We're just glad to have you back.","You're right, Korra.","It's true, there will always be new conflicts and enemies to face.","But the important thing is to ''learn'' from your enemies and better yourself over time, which you have.","You've changed so much since you first arrived on Air Temple Island.","When you first came here, you were hot-headed and a bit selfish.","But you've matured into a thoughtful young woman who puts the needs of others before herself.","The new Air Nation is a testament to that.","You sacrificed everything to save them.","You're an inspiration to the world.","I don't believe attacking is the right move, since she hasn't done anything aggressive toward the United Republic.","Please, Korra, it's not personal.","We just thought, perhaps we called you back into action a little too soon.","My airbenders ''won't'' be part of an unprovoked attack!","Korra, he's too dangerous.","Even when he's locked up, he can't be trusted.","There ''is'' another way.","I'm calling your father.","He can lead an expedition into the Spirit World from the Southern portal.","It's not that at all.","I'm just so worried for Jinora.","I can't imagine if something happened to you, too.","Zaheer's imprisoned deep in the mountains outside the city.","I'll call Raiko and get the clearance.","I'm so glad you're safe.","What happened?","How did you get out?","Is she going to use it against Republic City?","Rohan's with the Acolytes.","They have the boat ready to leave.","Why aren't you all packed yet?","What is it?","That sounds like a risk we don't need to take.","The evacuation is on schedule and General Iroh is getting his army in place.","But if you get caught ... Korra?","Are you all right?","Why are you back so soon?","No, they can't be!","We're not ready.","Pema!","Find Wu and get the remaining citizens to safety, immediately.","We can't have innocent lives in jeopardy.","Hmm ... Korra, I'm in.","Kuvira is heading our way, with a platoon of mecha suits!","Now!","Jinora!","A new spirit portal.","Keep looking!","Korra!","''Korra!''","The spirits have returned.","I spoke to President Raiko.","Tomorrow, he's announcing a plan to expand the city, rather than rebuild downtown.","Korra, you've transformed the world more in a few years than most Avatars did during their lifetimes.","You don't know how happy I am to hear you so full of hope again.","I've come to realize life is one, big, bumpy ride.","That doesn't seem like a good

You stayed and watched?","What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning?","The morning is ''evil''.","And you are ...?","I got nothing.","I've never really needed money.","I've always had people taking care of me.","Ahem.","Oh.","Hey, Mako.","Nice to see you, too.","And no.","I haven't seen him since practice.","Think something's wrong?","Wait.","I could, uh ... help you look for him.","My best friend.","''And'' a great tracker.","I'll take that as a compliment, city boy.","What's he talking about?","So where're we headed?","Whoa, Naga!","Naga, come!","Amon?","That anti-bending guy with a mask?","What do they want with the Triple Threats?","We've been out all night.","No sign of him.","Huh!","I have an idea!","The first day I got into town, I ran into an Equalist protester over there.","It's our only lead right now.","What?","Wha- Are you some kind of criminal?","I-I ... er ... eheh, humn, hmmehem.","Let's scram.","Why didn't the Equalists put a location on these?","So, it's a puzzle?","We'll attract less attention this way.","Uh ... invitation?","That's impossible.","There's no way.","There's Bolin.","Works for me.","Mako, good luck.","It's not enough.","Thanks.","This should be enough.","Yes, but ...","I was at an Equalist rally.","I saw Amon.","He can take people's bending away.","For good.","It's ... it's all right, Naga.","I just had a bad dream.","Nice to meet you.","Oh, thanks.","I think you're the first authority figure in the city who's happy I'm here.","Really?","Join your task force?","I can't.","I came to Republic City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin.","Right now, I just need to focus on that.","Hey, Bolin.","Yeah, sorry about that.","Wow, thanks.","What's this for?","Oh, that?","It was no big deal.","Mhmm.","Tell him I haven't changed my mind.","Heh, no it's not like that.","He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the council.","Yeah, that guy doesn't know how to take \"no\" for an answer.","Yeah, I'm fine.","I'm just really focused on my airbending right now is all.","To what?","I can't believe this is all for me.","Nice to meet you.","Right, greatness.","Really?","Because he hasn't mentioned you at all.","How did you two meet?","What?","Are you okay?","Yeah, terrific.","But ...","I think he presents a real problem.","Well, I ... What?","No!","I've never backed away from anything in my life!","I am not ''afraid'' of anybody!","If the city needs me then ...","I'll join Tarrlok's task force and help fight Amon.","I'm going after those two.","Nice timing.","Thanks, Tarrlok.","Yeah, we do.","You want to know why?","Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward.","Amon, I challenge you to a duel!","No task force, no chi blockers, just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island.","Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing, ''if'' you're man enough to face me.","Don't try to stop me and don't follow me.","I have to face Amon alone.","Guess you're a no-show, Amon.","Who's scared now?","Aang?","Yeah, he ambushed me.","No, I'm okay.","I was so terrified, I felt so helpless.","You ... you were right ...","I've been scared this whole time.","I've never felt like this before and ... and Tenzin, I don't know what to do!","Ah, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin.","See ya!","What?","Listen to you two, I-I'm not interested in Mako or ''any ''romantic stuff.","Besides he's all into that prissy, beautiful, elegant, rich girl ... but let's just pretend for a second I ''am'' interested in him.","What would I do?","Tell me!","Uhh ...","The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now.","Oh, hey Pema.","Uh, how long were you standing there?","So what did you do?","Yeah!","You know, I feel like the two of us have been connecting really well ''out'' of the ring, too.","So, I was thinking we should spend some time together.","I mean outside of the gym, and not while searching for kidnapped family members or fighting chi blockers.","Look, I really like you and I think we are meant for each other!","Forget I ever said anything ... Oh, that's really sweet, but I don't think so.","I don't feel very ''date''-worthy.","You really feel that way about me?","You know what?","I could use some fun.","Okay, sure!","Hmm, it's delicious and'' totally ''authentic!","I didn't realize how much I missed Water Tribe grub.","They are good noodles!","Hey, who's that creepy guy over there who keeps glaring at us?","You wanna go toe-to-toe with me, pretty boy?","Uh ... Pro-bending?","We've got the quarterfinal match.","I am not, we're just having fun together.","What do you care, anyway?","Wait a second ... you're not worried about him, you're jealous!","You ''do'' have feelings for me!","Admit it!","You like me.","Yeah, but when you're with her you're thinking about me, aren't you?","I'm just being honest.","You're a liar!","I had an opening so I took it!","Save your breath.","You've already made it clear how you feel about me.","So you ''do'' like me?","You're blaming me?","''You'' kissed me back!","Well played, Korra.","I'll unnecessarily rough you up!","Come on!","We still have a chance, even if it is a slim one!","Look, if we don't pull together and work as a team, we'll never forgive ourselves.","You're welcome.","So ...","I know things are confusing right now, but I hope we can still be friends.","I hope we see you in the finals.","Then we'll know who the losers ''really'' are.","Thanks!","But, if it hadn't been for you and your father, we wouldn't have had the chance to play.","So thank you.","Ooh, let me help!","Relax, I'm a healer!","I learned from Katara, the best there is.","Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.","I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand.","I had a great time, honestly!","You are one of a kind, Bolin.","What?","How is it over already?","Man, I got a good feeling about tonight.","I don't care if we are the underdogs.","We can take those pompous Wolfbats.","I'm not waiting to find out.","We need to get to City Hall.","As the Avatar and a pro-bending player, I have a right to be heard.","You can't cancel the finals.","What about the rest of you?","Tarrlok, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right?","I-I don't understand.","I thought you, of all people, would take a stand against Amon.","The reality is if you close the arena, you let Amon win!","Yeah, you do?","Thank you!","Excuse me, Chief Beifong.","I wanted to thank you for your help, it ... really ... means a lot ... What is her deal?","Even when she's on my side, she's against me!","What did your father do to make her hate the Avatar so much?","Wait a second ... it all makes sense now!","You and Beifong, Beifong and you.","You two were a couple!","Ha!","Your wife.","So ... Pema stole you from Beifong.","I'm surprised our \"esteemed Chief of Police\" didn't throw her in jail.","Hm, apparently Beifong hasn't.","See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker!","I'm gonna knock Tahno's ''stupid'' hair off his ''stupid'' head!","What's wrong with these refs?","If the Wolfbats are gonna fight dirty, then so should we.","Argh, that's no fun but ... all right.","Hmph, chump.","What?","I'm going after Amon!","I'm fine, thanks to you.","Guys!","Great news.","You don't have to go back on the streets.","I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements.","You can come live on Air Temple Island with me!","I was just leaving.","So, I guess I'll see you guys around, some time.","I don't know.","I have some ... Avatar stuff to do.","All right, Pabu.","Tahno?","Listen, I know we're not exactly best friends, but I'm sorry Amon took your bending.","Looks like you guys settled right in.","Way cooler than a makeover.","The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog.","Let's do it!","That was amazing!","I didn't think we'd make it.","Smart guy.","Uh, is there another bathroom I can use?","Thanks.","Uh, sorry!","I forgot, I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids.","See you later!","Well, I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard.","Sato's up to something.","A motive?","What is it?","That's terrible.","I overheard him on the phone yesterday.","Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists.","I overheard you on the phone.","You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time, and you're getting ready to strike.","Explain that!","I can't believe we didn't find anything.","No, I'm not!","I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying.","What?","Don't be ridiculous!","That has nothing to do with it!","I'm sorry.","Hiroshi is ''not'' the man you think he is.","I think you guys should hear this.","\"If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight.\"","I knew it!","Where?","Maybe you don't know everything about your father.","I'm sorry.","And I'm guessing ''those'' are the new weapons.","Hiroshi, I ''knew'' you were a lying, no good Equalist!","Come out here and- I know.","I'm sorry this whole thing happened.","Of course it does.","And Asami's welcome, too.","After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako.","Oh, I thought you were only bringing a ''few'' things.","No problem, everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome.","Meelo, why don't you go with the boys too?","Ikki and I will take you to your room this way.","So, here's your room.","I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to.","What is that weasel snake Tarrlok up to now?","Ha!","Forget it!","There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.","Don't hold your breath, bub.","You know, Tenzin's been right about you all along.","You played me, you played Beifong, and now you're playing the new Chief too.","Well, I got news for you.","You need me, but I don't need you.","I'm the Avatar.","I don't understand what's wrong with me.","I've memorized nearly all of the practice forms, but I still can't produce a single measly puff of air!","I'm a failure.","Amazing advice.","I'll get right on that.","No, of course I haven't.","Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus?","I'm a spiritual failure, too.","Maybe.","I had a few weird hallucinations, but I hardly even remember them.","I saw Aang.","It seemed like he was in trouble.","What do you think it means?","I'm fine.","How am I suppose to save this city when I can't even learn airbending?","I'm the worst Avatar ever!","I just feel ... alone.","Yeah, let's do it!","All right, Let's ride.","All right, scratch that.","Any other ideas?","Let's get 'em!","Oh, hey Tarrlok.","Nice of you to show up finally.","Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you.","Hmm, that's funny.","I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time.","If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would've gotten away.","What a gentleman, thanks!","Why is the power out?","Sure doesn't look that way.","Everyone, please stay calm.","I'm gonna put a stop to this.","Tarrlok, you need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone.","We're not going anywhere.","You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals.","Stop!","Tarrlok!","Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin.","He can get you out.","This isn't over, Tarrlok.","Hey!","I don't know!","These knuckleheads won't tell me anything.","Your so called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists.","They should be released, too.","You're officially the worst Chief of Police ever!","Wake up, Naga.","Let's go.","Wait for me here, girl.","Don't worry, I'll be all right.","You and I need to talk.","Don't you see?","You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders.","You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people!","Of- Of course not!","You and I are ''nothing'' alike!","That's why you arrested them?","To get to me?","You need to be stopped!","You're just as bad as Amon!","Still think that I'm a half-baked Avatar?","What are you gonna do now?","You're all out of water, pal.","You're, you're a bloodbender?","It's not a full moon!","How- how are you doing this?!","Where are you taking me?","You can't do this!","Let me out!","Garh!","Somebody!","Help!","Please!","Please.","Whoa.","I finally connected with you, Aang.","But, what are you trying to tell me?","A way out of this box would be nice.","Aang ... this whole time ... you were trying to warn me about Tarrlok.","So your little bloodbending secret's out?","And I know how you bloodbent me without a full moon.","You're Yakone's son.","Tarrlok, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go.","You'll never get away with this!","Naga.","You came looking for me.","Good girl.","I'm fine.","I'm glad you're here.","Mmm.","Mmm.","The food tastes amazing, Pema.","I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.","Well, first off, Tarrlok isn't who he says he is.","He's Yakone's son.","Amon captured him, and took his bending.","Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere.","He almost got me, too.","We heard explosions, what's going on?","It's right around here somewhere.","There it is.","Hey, you guys got arrested and left me alone with the car!","I made it very clear I don't know how to drive.","Everything all right?","Are you all right?","What do you want to do, Tenzin?","I'm not giving up.","What you're saying is, we need to be patient.","You too.","Everyone, climb on!","Let's go, girl!","Nice one, Naga!","I hate this \"being patient\" stuff.","Thanks so much for letting us hide out with you the past few days.","No, I have this awful pit in my stomach.","I think you're pretty incredible too, but ... you already knew that.","I should probably try to get some sleep.","Good night.","Once the United Forces arrive, we need to be ready to help in any way we can.","Wait a second ... where are the Equalist airships?","It's all right, I've got you.","I know.","Every time we think we have an advantage, Amon outsmarts us.","I know just the man for the job.","Tenzin's brother?","Wait, I'm sorry, but I'm not going with you tomorrow.","I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon.","It's time I face him.","I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down.","My guts tell me it's time to end this, on ''my'' terms.","You don't have to do that.","I will.","Good luck.","If you're going into the mountains, you should bring Naga.","Take good care of Bolin for me.","There's Amon.","We ambush him.","We'll be there, sir.","I know another way in.","Let's hide in the attic.","Tarrlok?","We had no idea you were here.","Are there other prisoners on the island?","And what makes you so special?","What?","How did your brother end up becoming Amon?","That's one of the saddest stories I've ever heard.","So, he somehow uses bloodbending to take people's bending.","How in the world do we beat him?","So much for our ambush.","If we stay here, we're toast.","But there's another way to beat him.","This whole time, Amon has been one step ahead of us.","But finally ''we'' have the advantage.","We know the truth about him.","If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters ... ... We could take away his true power!","Thank you, for your help.","We can't just leave him here.","That's a lie, Amon!","Or should I call you Noatak?","Amon has been lying to you.","The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away.","He uses bloodbending to do it.","Amon is a waterbender!","Your family wasn't killed by a firebender.","His father was Yakone, and his brother ... is Councilman Tarrlok.","What?","No ... they got away.","We saw them get away!","Amon, let them go!","I don't care!","We have to save them!","Where are Pema and the baby?","Beifong?","Follow me, kids.","Get them out of here.","We'll create a diversion.","No!","Mako ... my bending.","No!","I - I can airbend?","I can airbend!","No ... you ... ''don't''!","But Amon got away.","No, it's not.","Go away.","No, I mean, go away, back to Republic City.","Get on with your life.","I'm not the Avatar anymore.","You don't need to do me any favors.","I - I can't.","Not now Tenzin, I just want to be left alone.","Aang.","How?","I love you too.","It's the Avatar State and I'm the Avatar.","Who appreciates it more than me?","Great, ''more'' attention.","Before we go on your dad's study trip, we're gonna have some real fun in my home town at the Glacier Spirits Festival.","They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks.","Ooh, I like that one.","That sounds so fun.","All I do is train all day.","It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.","Of course you'd take his side!","I'm gonna take a walk.","You remember Mako.","Knock it off, Dad.","Uh, no.","They came to greet ''them.''","That's Eska and Desna, the chief's children.","Desna is a guy.","Good to see you too.","I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival.","It's fun.","Wait, spirits are attacking ships?","I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits.","Airbending is getting pretty boring.","This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle.","Wow, I've never seen that.","I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?","Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's.","Those two have always creeped me out.","They smell like a grandma's attic.","Unalaq offered to train me.","He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them.","Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids.","I'll never finish training with him in charge.","I mean, you heard what Unalaq said.","The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it, but my dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me.","Well?","What do you think I should do?","Oh thanks.","That's a big help.","Just forget it.","Uh, Naga what are you doing?","Naga, hush!","Quiet, Naga, you'll wake everyone up!","What, is, that?","How are you able to control that spirit when no one else could?","Ugh Hey!","I'm right here!","Anyone want to ask me what I think?","I'm tired of listening to you.","Both of you.","You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best.","But both of you were powerless against the spirit attack.","I think it's time I had a new teacher.","Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn.","I have to go with him.","I'm sorry, Tenzin.","This is as far as we go.","Do you think I did the right thing?","What can I say?","I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting.","You're going to train me at the South Pole?","A dangerous trip to the South Pole?","Count me in!","I thought you said Bolin was coming?","Thanks, Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine.","Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?","What happened in the past?","No, the conversation is over.","Dad, come if you want, just don't interfere with my training.",".","So once we get to the South Pole, then what happens?","I'm sorry, what now?","And that's why the evil spirits are attacking?","What do you mean ... in time?","The winter solstice is tomorrow.","Easy, Naga.","Dark spirits.","Uncle, why do you think the dark spirits are following us?","Told me what!?","You were banished from the North?","Why?","I can't believe you kept this from me.","Why did you keep hiding things from me and then telling me it's for my own protection?","I'm tired of you ''protecting'' me!","Dad, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits and the physical world, and I finally have a chance to live up to my potential.","The Northern Lights.","No, Dad, ''you're'' leaving.","Then what are we waiting for?","So, what exactly were you and my dad talking about?","Y'know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.","Trees frozen in the ice.","So, what do I do?","But I don't have any connection with the spirits.","In fact, it seems like they hate me.","I guess I'm just so used to people telling me how to do things that I forgot what it was like to have someone trust in me.","Wait here, I'll be okay.","The spirit portal.","Amazing.","The light in the dark.","Why isn't it opening?","Come on portal, open!","The spirits, dancing in the sky.","Everything you said was true.","Thanks.","By the way, I'm really sorry for being a total pain.","Things were really stressful and pretty confusing.","It's hard being the Avatar.","What are all your Northern troops doing here?","Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?","''I'' can protect it.","But, the solstice is over.","How am I going to open it?","With both portals open, our tribes will be united again.","Chief Unalaq is here to help the South.","He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.","All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.","You want to start a war?","Are you crazy?","I'll do it for the tribe.","I'm sorry to interrupt.","It's about our conversation this morning.","I understand why you brought your troops here, but I'm afraid it's sending the wrong message.","Not just him.","Varrick too.","There was a meeting at my parents' house.","A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.","I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war.","How do we stop it?","I'm usually the one starting fights.","I don't know how to stop them from happening.","Maybe Tenzin was right.","Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.","Thank you, Uncle.","Stop!","Everyone, calm down.","You're all part of the same tribe, start acting like it.","I'm not taking anyone's side.","Hey!","Oh, fabulous.","My tribe's about to go to war, and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me?","No!","And I didn't ask for my father's help.","Can't he just let me be the Avatar?","Ugh.","I'm sorry.","My dad just gets me all worked up.","Uh, 'cause I thought it was pretty obvious?","Did Dad send you to talk to me?","Ask Dad.","You knew?","And you never said anything.","I never wanted a normal childhood.","All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar.","But everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents!","Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.","No?","Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?","So I should just sit back and let the Water Tribes go to war?","Dad is part of a rebellion?","It's too late, Mom.","I'm already in the middle of it.","Uncle!","Oh, no.","Uncle?","Dad?","Dad, don't do this.","No.","Leave Unalaq and go.","I'll tell him I tried to stop you, but you escaped.","We can still avoid a war.","We're all part of the same tribe.","I don't wanna hurt you.","Dad, stop!","Why did you do this, Dad?","What?","Who are you?","Where's my father?","I'm just glad I got here in time.","Wait, you can't just lock them away.","That will only make the South angrier.","No.","But let them stand trial for what they did.","Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.","Thank you, Uncle.","Is it okay if I come in?","I'm so glad you weren't there.","I don't know what I would've done.","I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels.","And for all the pain I've caused you and Mom.","Mom, Dad, of course I still need you.","You're making a mistake.","I can't believe you're doing this to your own family.","Uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you.","I hope so.","Yes.","Well, yes, but - My parents' house.","My parents are innocent!","You can't do this!","You take their lives, and I'll take yours!","Thank you, Uncle.","Good, let's bust you out of here right now.","Fine.","I promise.","It's okay, Mom.","I know.","It's not about what ''I'' want.","It's about what Naga wants.","And she'd like you to let my father out of prison.","What are you talking about?","Unless you wanna be Naga's afternoon snack, you'd better keep talking.","So Unalaq told you what to say?","Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?","What do you mean, \"he got my father banished\"?","Keep talking.","Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!","I found out the truth about my dad's banishment.","Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe.","Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them.","Just like the whole trial.","I can't believe I trusted him.","I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail.","I need your help.","I know.","Will you help me or not?","I'm pretty sure the ''guy'' is supposed to give the ''girl'' the betrothal necklace.","My dad's in there.","Where is he?","Where's my father?","Bring him back.","Or I'm taking you out and the rest of your army.","You don't want unity.","You want power.","You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you?","You got him banished so you could become chief, and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father.","No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him.","Well, I don't want your help anymore.","I'm done being manipulated by you.","You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North.","Because you still need ''me'' to open the Northern portal.","Let's go.","On a ship headed north.","Think we can catch up to it?","If only we had a plane to get me close to those ships.","I could waterbend them out of the way.","I have an idea.","Now!","There!","My dad's on ''that'' ship!","Jump!","Where are the prisoners?","So once I knew the truth, I couldn't sit by and do nothing.","Mine too.","I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad.","But you said the South doesn't stand a change against Unalaq's forces.","I can help.","For what?","I started a civil war.","I ''didn't'' start a war.","Well, I did, but it's more complicated than you're making it seem.","I'll go too.","The people of the South need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders.","What?","I'm not neutral!","The North invaded my home.","The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South.","I'm going to find out about this peace march.","The Northern Water Tribe is out of control!","Of course, they're responsible.","Who else would it be?","I hope President Raiko listens to us.","Hello, Mr. President.","Sir, the Southern Water Tribe- Unalaq's troops have invaded the South.","We need you to send the United Forces to help.","Unalaq isn't even the rightful ruler of the Water Tribe.","He lied his way onto the Northern throne.","\"The people responsible\"?","Who else would it be but the Northerners?","You're the one who's lost perspective.","I'm trying to save my tribe, and you're taking pictures.","My family is going to be wiped out, and it'll be on ''your'' head for doing ''nothing'' about it.","I can't believe the President is doing nothing!","H-He doesn't even care!","How could you take ''his'' side?","Well, you're not ''helping'' me!","I'm trying to get troops to the South.","What are ''you'' doing?","Well, ''excuse me'', officer.","Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets.","I'm just trying to save the world.","I can't talk to you when you're like this.","Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick.","We can't wait for the President to act.","We need those troops ''now''.","I know General Iroh.","He might be willing to help us.","That's perfect!","You'll be making money for your company ''and'' you'll be helping to defeat Unalaq.","I don't understand why it's so hard to get Republic City to support the South.","Thank you for seeing me, General Iroh.","The South needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely, but the President is refusing to give the order.","So I decided to come to you directly.","I guess you wouldn't.","Thank you!","I ''hate'' that guy!","I understand.","Thanks anyway.","Thank you, General.","Bolin, I need you to watch Naga while I'm gone.","The Fire Nation.","I'm going to try to get them to help the South.","I need a boat.","He was going to help, but then President Raiko showed up.","Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't figure it out.","No one knew about it except for us and Asami.","Mako?","You ratted me out to the President?","Explain why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?","You betrayed me, and my family!","Well, I ''have'' a job to do too, only it seems like ''you're'' always standing in the way of me getting it ''done''!","So, what?","Are you breaking up with me?","Get away from me!","Who's-who's \"Avatar Korra\"?","I ... don't know.","I can't remember anything.","Raava.","Raava.","Raava.","Who are you?","Who am I?","I don't know what that is.","How do I regain my connection?","Are you Raava?","Raava.","I found you.","I remember.","My name is Korra.","I'm the Avatar.","Thank you for all your kindness.","I wonder how long I've been away.","I have to close the spirit portal before that happens.","Tenzin's itinerary.","We went over it like a hundred times before we left Republic City.","It's so great to see you all again.","Wait, you don't know about the Civil War?","So much.","I-I don't know where to start.","Everything?","Okay.","I opened a spirit portal at the South Pole, but then Unalaq turned out to be a bad guy and wanted to take control of the South, so I sort of started a Civil War, but when I went to find some help, I was attacked by my cousins, and then by a giant dark spirit, and then I forgot who I was, and then I met the first Avatar, and then I realized I shouldn't have opened the portal in the first place, and now I need to close it again!","Yes, and now I think my uncle is trying to free him.","This is all my fault.","Thank you.","I thought about that.","My best chance to close the portal is from the inside.","I have to enter the Spirit World.","Wow!","Spirit World, here we come.","I thought your bell ringing was just fine.","We could have tried a little longer.","I am focusing.","Okay, I feel it.","What's going on with you?","First, you're blaming Meelo, then Kya, and now me.","I don't want to rush your feelings, but we're kind of in a hurry.","How did you first get into the Spirit World?","Let's try that.","You've never been into the Spirit World?","Are they here to help?","No offense, but I'm guessing the spirits have actually been to the Spirit World, so I'm gonna follow them.","You have a natural gift.","That's pretty lucky.","It's a him, Avatar Wan.","He was amazing.","I saw how he became the first Avatar by fusing with Raava, the Spirit of Light.","When did this happen?","That's the day I opened the Southern portal.","Look.","There are carvings on them.","Not bats.","Dark spirits.","Unalaq may be a horrible person, but his spirit powers are no joke.","Everything Unalaq taught me was to help himself.","Everything you've done was meant to help me.","I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor.","I need you now more than ever.","Why don't you go first?","Tenzin, we're running out of time.","We'll be all right.","The Spirit World.","Just ... stick close to me, okay?","This seems nice, but you never know when we'll run into some dark spirits.","Huh!","Jinora, be careful!","Hold on!","Uh!","Sorry!","I'm the Avatar.","I'm trying to find the spirit portals?","I opened one- No, I did, but- B-because I was at the South Pole!","Get away from me!","Jinora!","Jinora!","Jinora?","Jinora!","Jinora.","Jinora.","Ahhh!","Get away!","I'm sorry I swatted you.","You just scared me.","I know you.","Iroh!","How can you marry each other?","Aren't you ... How long have you lived here?","I came here with my friend, but I lost her and now I'm all alone.","No!","It's not okay!","Jinora's gone and I need to find her!","She's lost, and we need to go home!","I don't like the Spirit World, I don't want to be here anymore!","I'm sorry.","I can make the sun shine?","I'm looking for my friend.","I want her here now!","Why didn't she come out like the sun?","But what am I supposed to do?","I'll take him home!","Where do I go?","This looks scary.","Will you come with me?","No!","Bye!","Okay, time for you to go home.","Light and peace ... light and peace ...","I'm not afraid of you.","You're not scary!","You just look that way.","I have light inside!","It's okay, you can be my friends.","My name is Korra, and I'm taking this dragon bird home!","Iroh said you could be nice.","Do you wanna help me?","All right, now let's close that portal and go find Jinora.","That's where Vaatu is.","I think you've said that before, Vaatu.","But I'm here to close the portal.","You're not getting out.","Jinora!","I can't believe I trusted you!","You made me think you wanted to restore balance with spirits, but this- this isn't balance, it's madness!","Now let her go!","Stop!","I'll do it.","Now let Jinora go.","Ahhh!","Ahhh!","Tenzin- I'm ...","I'm sorry.","I'm so sorry, Pema.","I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me.","President Raiko!","Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed.","Unalaq doesn't just wanna take over the South anymore.","He wants to destroy the whole world.","He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during Harmonic Convergence, which is only a few days away.","If he succeeds, the world as we know it, is over.","Sir, we desperately need your help.","Thank you.","It's so good to see you guys again.","Wait.","Where's Mako?","Mako, I've missed you so much.","Why would I be mad?","No, not really.","I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while.","Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.","Was it a bad fight?","Zhu Li's in prison with you?","You have a battleship?","It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing.","I hope my dad's all right.","I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock Vaatu in for another ten thousand years, and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born.","Thanks Mako.","Did you want something?","Mom!","Where's Dad?","I'll get him back.","I talked to the rebels.","They said Unalaq's got the southern portal surrounded.","Harmonic Convergence is only a few hours away.","There's no use in talking any more.","We know what our mission is.","What are you thinking?","Let's get moving.","There are spirits everywhere.","I don't see an opening.","Dad ... Don't give up.","Harmonic Convergence isn't here yet.","We still have a chance.","You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq.","Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful, it will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened over the last ten thousand years.","Even if Vaatu escapes, I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did.","Eska, Desna, listen to me.","You've got to help us stop Unalaq.","I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy.","Please.","If you let me out now, I can still stop him from destroying everything.","Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe.","Desna, he won't be your father anymore.","No, you're too hurt, you need a healer.","Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom?","This is my fight now.","I love you too, Dad.","Once we're inside, you go find Jinora.","Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq, while I close the portal so Vaatu can't escape.","If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after Harmonic Convergence.","If not ... Let's go.","Tenzin, go find Jinora!","I'm not going to let you fuse with Unalaq.","You're going right back in that prison.","Don't let Unalaq back in the Spirit World.","No!","I'm locking you away for another ten thousand years, Vaatu!","No!","Well I'm the old Avatar, and my era's not over yet!","Raava.","You cannot win.","Did you find Jinora?","She was right.","No.","They fused, then Vaatu ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her.","Vaatu won.","When Vaatu destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too.","The cycle is over.","I'm the last Avatar.","I'm so sorry, Tenzin.","No one can help me now.","How?","Haven't you heard anything I said?","Raava is gone.","I'm not connected to her spirit anymore.","Why are you showing me Vaatu's prison?","And, you think this tree can help me somehow?","These are my memories.","Avatar Wan.","But, he was brave, and ... smart, and always wanted to defend the helpless.","Everyone in Republic City is in danger.","How?","We're half-way around the world.","You really think I can do this?","Thank you for not giving up on me.","Raava!","Go in peace.","It's over.","I'm sorry about your father.","But he was already fused with Vaatu.","I couldn't save him.","No.","I think that link is gone, forever.","Maybe I shouldn't.","What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds?","What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals?","What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart?","Well, what do you think I should do?","Of course.","I remember.","I did, but being inside the Tree of Time brought it back.","I'm sorry for blowing up at you.","Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?","I think we both know that this.","Us?","Doesn't work.","It's over.","For real this time.","And I'll always love you.","The war of the Water Tribes is over.","Unalaq has been defeated, and the Northern fleet is returning home.","The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent, and the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new chief!","I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path.","So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open.","Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World, and spirits will be free to roam our world.","I will no longer be the bridge.","Humans and spirits must learn to live together.","My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance.","Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy.","I can feel it.","Things will never be the same again.","We're entering a New Age.","How are we ever gonna clear away all these vines?","Ugh, I don't get it.","I can vanquish Vaatu but not a bunch of stupid vines?","I don't think that the people who used to live here are as excited about it as you are.","I gotta go face the press and tell them I ''still'' don't have a way to get rid of the vines.","This should be fun.","Listen, I've been trying everything I can think of to get rid of these vines, but- Look, Harmonic Convergence was just a couple weeks ago.","I just needed a little more time to get everything back to normal.","Oh, I'm sorry.","Did I put you in a difficult position by fighting the giant force of pure evil that was going to destroy the whole world?","Maybe your administration could have handled that.","This is a disaster.","Easy for you to say.","You don't have my poll numbers.","Eight percent approval?","Who are they asking?","I don't blame them.","I should be able to fix this.","I'm the Avatar.","What's up with him?","''Still''?","Do you think being in the Spirit World during Harmonic Convergence could have given him bending?","Wait, we'll help you look for him.","Where should we start?","Okay.","How are you doing?","You know, you're welcome to stay here instead of sleeping at the police station.","This is so exciting!","New airbenders in the city.","I bet we can find that guy before Mako does.","You know I'm not very good at this.","How long do you think talking to Mako is gonna be like pulling teeth?","So, when I was gone, did he tell you that we broke up?","That's pretty embarrassing.","No wonder he's so nervous around us!","No!","I mean, I kissed Mako when he was going out with you, so ...","I'm so sorry!","I thought you knew!","Well, whatever happened with Mako, I'm glad it hasn't come between us.","I've never had a girlfriend to hang out with and talk to before, except for Naga.","This is nice.","What are you doing living in the middle of the road in the first place?!","Look, I don't have anything against spirits, but these vines are causing major problems all over the city!","I think that spirit just gave me an idea how to get rid of these vines ...","But I'm gonna need a lot of water.","I hope this works.","What are you guys doing here?","Go in peace.","Look out!","Let's go, people!","Hurry.","Hang on.","Can't talk.","Meditating.","I thought if I really tried I might be able to contact my past Avatars, someone who knows something to help me, but I can't.","They're gone and I'm all alone.","Did I ruin everything by leaving the spirit portals open?","I know the people's point of view.","It's bad.","Right.","It's scary.","I have all this power and all these people depending on me, but I don't know what I am supposed to be doing half the time.","It seems like I should be ... wiser.","Avatar wisdom is the thing of the past, Bolin.","Come on.","Depends who you ask.","Don't panic, I'm just here to talk.","Tell me about it.","Rough day, huh?","I'm having kind of a rough day myself.","You mind if I sit down here?","Look, I know you're scared.","You've gone through a big change and its kind of my fault.","But you're not alone, there are other airbenders and they want to help you.","Actually, they are really excited to meet you.","I'm sorry, I can't, but I promise you things will get better if you just give it a chance.","Let me take you over to Air Temple Island and we can talk this through.","Okay?","Daw, this is Tenzin.","He is going to help you.","Listen, I know you're having a tough time getting used to these changes and I'm sorry for that, but ''you'' and everyone else are going to have to learn live with it.","The vines and the spirits are here to stay.","Don't worry, I was already leaving.","I can see my path now.","There are new airbenders out there and I'm going to find them and rebuild the Air Nation.","It's perfect!","Thanks Asami.","Mako, I'm so glad you're here.","Right, the Avatar thanks you for your loyal service.","Did you find any more leads?","Actually, I was kind of hoping you could come, too.","I know things have been weird between us since we broke up, but you're a part of Team Avatar, and we can't do this without you.","We're going to bring the Air Nation back from the brink of extinction after nearly two hundred years.","Thanks.","Actually, this bald man does want to take him, but it's for an important cause.","Your dad is an airbender, and he should learn about his culture.","In my head, I saw that playing out very differently.","Okay, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding.","It's time for a little tough love.","How old is he?","Well, I have a great opportunity for him.","We're looking for airbenders to join us at the Northern Air Temple.","Hi, I'm Korra.","Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity.","Well, you're gonna be interested.","You're an airbender now and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world.","Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties.","Yes, I do have to.","Yes, I do!","Well, if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos.","Think about that!","Is that what you want?","No, it's not!","Everyone cares!","Yes, you do!","Well, you're about to care, you little slacker, because you're coming with me!","That's it!","I don't know what to do.","I just thought more people would be excited about coming with us.","It sounds ridiculous, but it might work.","I will.","With my airbending skills!","We got our first recruit.","Just to be totally clear, we're going to be heading to Ba Sing Se, then the Northern Air Temple to live as nomads and rebuild the Air Nation.","All that sound good to you?","We'll keep you safe, come on.","We are not running away from anyone.","If you want Kai, you'll have to go through me!","Your days of harassing an innocent boy is over.","You outlaws are going to prison.","Where's Kai?","Is that true?","Wait!","You've got the family's life savings, now let us take Kai.","He just needs some guidance, Tenzin.","Who better to give it to him than us?","Don't make me regret it.","It's so exciting to be on a diplomatic mission to Ba Sing Se.","What's the Earth Queen like?","I wonder how many airbenders are down there.","Uhh, the Lower Ring looks terrible.","Thank you.","Seems like an awful lot of rules.","Well, actually Your Majesty, I was hoping you could ... Well, I uh, I'm not sure what I can do about that.","I'm very sorry for your troubles, but actually ...","I don't really have servants.","But, Your Majesty, the reason for our visit is that we're trying to gather all of the new airbenders who are popping up in the Earth Kingdom, and we'd like your help finding the ones in Ba Sing Se.","Before we left Republic City we got some reports.","Oh, of course.","What is it?","Yes, Your Majesty.","There are royal guards waiting at the vault.","I doubt anything will happen.","I think Her Majesty likes ordering me around.","I don't like the looks of this.","Let's hurry up and get out of here.","Go ahead and load it on the airship.","Maybe we should have brought everybody else.","Sorry to disappoint you, but we're taking this gold back to Ba Sing Se.","Why do I get the feeling he's right?","So now, Your Majesty, if I could start meeting some of the airbenders here in the city.","You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens for your stupid palaces and topiaries and then you just want to send me away?","We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders!","We know there are some here!","This isn't over!","I'm going to find the airbenders!","I know that Earth Queen is lying to me!","I can tell by that stupid little queenly smirk of hers!","I can't believe I helped her.","I should have known she was using me!","Sorry.","She ''was'' lying.","I knew it!","I swear, the next time I see her- Thank you!","That is just the most wonderful news.","Ever.","Yay.","Uhh, this evening?","I'm not sure about leaving so soon- Thanks for buying us some time.","Those people should not be forced to join an army!","Don't worry, Jinora.","We'll find him.","We just need to figure out where to look.","Let's go get Kai out.","Let's get all the airbenders out.","What happened?","What did you see?","Jinora, you've read all about Ba Sing Se.","Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be?","Maybe there is.","How did you find me during Harmonic Convergence?","Maybe you can find Kai the same way.","I know you two have a connection.","I can't believe Miss Queeny Smug Face had them right under our noses the whole time!","Everyone, act natural.","And Bolin - What?!","What's going on?","Why is Lord Zuko with my dad?","All right, hold on!","Will you quit ignoring me and tell me what's going on?","Who's Zaheer?","Why is my life in danger?","So ''that's'' why you and my dad sheltered me away.","No ...","I'm not running.","Look, I'm not a little kid anymore.","You don't need to protect me.","I came here for one thing: to find airbenders.","And I'm not leaving without them.","In a military compound, and we're busting them out.","I'm the Avatar, and I'm getting you all out of here.","Yes, and we must leave now.","Come on!","It's clear.","These airbenders shouldn't be used as weapons!","They have a right to choose their own paths.","They're leaving with me!","Where are the others?","Good luck at the Northern Air Temple.","I'll send more airbenders your way when I find them.","I'll try.","Seems like wherever I go, I make a new enemy.","This is only the beginning.","Relax, we just got here.","Besides, no one knows where I am except us.","I think she wants you to throw it for her.","Finally!","Where are they?","You know the place?","Sorry, if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we are going next.","Why not?","Fine.","You got it, Chief Crankypants.","Thanks for having us.","Yup.","Just us.","So, can I meet the new airbender?","Wow.","Is this where the airbender lives?","Is this some kind of combat training?","So, you're a dancer.","What?","I, uh, I didn't.","I mean ... How did you know I was lying?","We came with Republic City's Chief of Police.","She didn't want anyone to know she was here.","I'm sorry I didn't tell you.","Wait, you two know each other?","No.","Why would she?","I found out why you're so against coming here.","Why didn't you ever tell me you had a sister?","You two haven't spoken in ''thirty'' years?","How come?","Lin, your niece is the new airbender!","Isn't that amazing?","Nice to meet you.","It's great to meet you, Opal.","Oh, I'm sorry.","But I was hoping she could train with the rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple.","I guess I could help her get started.","She's just a little worried because there's a bunch of crazy criminals after me.","Why do you have such a problem with your sister?","She seems nice.","Come on, we can stay a little while.","Okay.","Let's see what you've got.","That's okay.","I've never been a teacher before, so we're in the same boat.","You'd want to keep your elbows in, torso straight, feet just skimming the ground.","Why don't you try it with me?","Woah.","You're a natural.","Honestly, not great.","We had to rescue a whole group of them from the Earth Queen.","I ...","I haven't really thought about it too much.","Lin!","It's amazing.","Thank you for being so welcoming.","And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting.","Can I ask what happened with you two?","That sounds like a good thing.","It sounds like you've created the perfect life here.","Can I steal you away from Bolin for a minute?","I need you help with something.","Hey, it's me.","I brought someone who wants to talk to you.","What's your problem?","Don't get mad at Opal.","I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in.","But I guess I was wrong.","Su's right.","You're never going to change.","You're always gonna be a bitter, lonely woman.","I think she's still sulking in her room.","Um.","I don't think I'd be much competition, since I can't metalbend.","Nope.","And I guessed I never thought to bring it up because I was learning to airbend, then there was the pro-bending, then I got tied up fighting Equalists.","It was a busy few months.","Really?","That would be great!","That's amazing!","Okay.","Bolin?","Is that you?","What are you doing?","He's on your shoulder.","I can't believe it!","I'm metalbending!","Are you going to stay in your room feeling sorry for yourself all day?","You owe Opal an apology for the way you treated her last night.","Are you okay?","You don't look good.","Should I stop them?","Uhh, Whose going to knock?","Uhh, I can.","But I just thought that ... With Beifong's sister in Zaofu.","We're totally safe, unless we get caught in another fight between Su and Lin.","Not exactly.","We got a call about an airbender and it turned out to be Su's daughter Opal.","She'll be headed your way soon.","How's the training going?","You need to give yourself a break.","Let Jinora and the kids help you out, and what about Bumi?","He was a naval commander, maybe he has some ideas about how you get people motivated.","Yeah, but he loves to organize people.","If you ask him for help, you can trick him into taking more responsibility by making him think the whole thing with his idea.","Conflict resolution, that's what I do.","Woo-hoo!","Metalbending champion!","Wait, that can find airbenders?","The- the guards.","It had to be one of them.","Lin, stop!","Your sister was not involved!","This is a waste of time!","Just bring in the next guard!","That guard knows everything.","We have to get him to talk.","I don't know, but we all saw the evidence.","It's pretty overwhelming.","What do you think is down there?","We came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers.","We're just looking for answers.","I'm still a little new at this, so back off!","Ugh!","Look, he must've escaped through there!","Help me clear it out.","Your trusted adviser is the one who betrayed us.","He was lying about the guard.","We confronted him and he bolted through here.","This is where Zaheer got in and out.","Aiwei was the traitor.","That's why we have to find them.","We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei.","Naga can track his scent.","If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere.","I have to stop them!","Stop trying to protect me!","I'm the Avatar.","This is my job!","But ... they ... Fine, if you really think it's best.","Su.","Definitely.","What?","Why?","Let's get this guy!","Thanks.","Aiwei has definitely been through here.","Nice tracking, girl.","They weren't hers to keep!","I swear, if I see her pinchy little queen face again, I am going to ... Naga found something.","Oh ...","Sorry, I forgot to bring treats but, good girl.","I'm coming too.","All right.","I'm just frustrated.","What does Zaheer want with me?","What's his plan?","Xai Bau's Grove, sundown.","This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer!","That's great!","And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer.","There he is.","Okay, I'll put that on my to-do list, right after bringing back the Air Nation and taking down the group that tried to kidnap me.","Then I make him talk.","You have a better idea?","It's almost sundown.","Why hasn't Aiwei left yet?","I'm going over there.","It's over, Aiwei!","Where's ...?","What?","He's not sleeping.","He's meditating.","Wait!","Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier.","Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the physical world!","It's in the Spirit World!","I'm going in after him.","Zaheer!","That's right.","We knew he'd lead us straight to you.","Now, what did you do with him?","Don't move, Zaheer.","You're going to give me some answers.","First off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?","''Red'' Lotus?","Are you related to the White Lotus?","That's a great story, but it doesn't explain why you tried to take me when I was a kid.","What?","My uncle was part of the Red Lotus?","Avatar Wan wasn't foolish!","He was trying to restore balance.","So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu?","That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?","It sounds like you were just trying to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted.","If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when I was a kid, why wasn't he caught?","So he betrayed you, just like he betrayed me.","And what is your mission, exactly?","I don't think our ideas of balance are the same.","What do you mean?","No.","I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out world leaders isn't the answer.","But that won't bring balance.","It will throw the world into ''chaos''.","No.","Zaheer, please, as an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world, instead of destroying it.","Enough with your philosophical mumbo-jumbo!","I want to know one thing.","If you do capture me, what are you going to do with me?","Zaheer!","Zaheer, you tricked me!","Let me go!","Asami, are you okay?","Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?","Where are we?","You have to let me out!","The Earth Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus.","I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday.","He's insane!","Can I have ... some water?","I hoped Mako or Bolin would have shown up to save us by now.","I wonder if they're okay.","We have to find a way to get out of this prison before we get to the Earth Queen.","Guards!","Get in here!","Something happened to my friend.","She needs help.","Nice work.","Now let's take control of the ship.","Sorry, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk.","You're the engineer.","What do you think?","Can we get flying again?","Is everyone all right?","I'm sorry.","But I couldn't let you take me to the Earth Queen as a captive.","There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about.","I'm not waiting around for that.","We need to get out of here ''now''.","You realize that I'm the Avatar, right?","You don't want to fight me.","Oh right, so I guess that's my fault too.","Do you want to help us get this ship up and running, or do you want to wait around and meet ''that'' thing?","Everybody stand back.","I just airbent all the sand out of the engine room.","I think it's clean.","How's it going out here?","That's no spirit!","I think it's gone now.","How far are we from the edge of the desert?","It's worth a try.","No time for a test run.","Let's move!","I'm sorry for getting us stranded out there.","I didn't mean for that to happen.","Dhaaah!","Easy, girl.","Did you think we weren't coming back to you?","What are you all doing here?","Yeah, we made it out of the desert.","Thanks to Asami.","It's good to see you, Lord Zuko.","Yeah, sorry about that.","But, how did you all find us?","What about her?","The Red Lotus.","The name of the group that's been trying to capture me and just took out the Earth Queen.","I'm afraid this is only the beginning, Dad.","It's really good to see you, too.","Both of you.","Uhm, thanks.","You too?","What?","How did you escape?","What?","Why would he do that?","Zaheer's threatening innocent lives just to get to me.","We need to radio Tenzin and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming.","Let's go.","We'll radio Su on the way.","Hopefully she can get a hold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu.","Did you have any luck getting through to Tenzin?","I can't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the Northern Air Temple.","We have to do something.","There might be another way to stop him.","It's a long shot, but Zaheer is always meditating into the Spirit World.","And I know exactly where he goes: Xai Bau's Grove.","If I can find him there, maybe I could somehow trap him.","I'll be fine.","I have to try.","Zaheer!","Come out!","Face me!","Leave the airbenders out of this!","There you are.","Iroh?","What are you doing here?","I am.","There's a maniac on the loose and he's threatening to destroy the new Air Nation.","I don't know what to do.","I know many Avatars have needed guidance.","But I'm the only one since Avatar Wan that can't get help from my past lives.","I wish I could talk to Aang.","Lord Zuko, of course.","Thank you!","Thank you so much.","You're right about the Spirit World.","I came here looking for someone else, but I'm glad I found you.","No, he wasn't there.","But there's someone I need to talk to.","You're leaving?","Aren't you coming to the air temple with us?","I understand.","You have to keep the Fire Lord safe.","But before you leave, I was wondering if you could help me with something.","That just it.","You knew Aang better than anyone.","I was wondering if you knew what he might do if he were in my situation.","So he would give himself up to save the Air Nation?","Thanks.","Your uncle was right.","It was helpful talking to you.","Yes.","In the Spirit World.","A couple of times actually.","Meelo, this is your commanding officer.","Go get your dad, now!","Come on, come on!","Tenzin!","Listen to me carefully.","Zaheer is on his way to the temple.","He's coming for the airbenders.","You have to get everyone out of there immediately.","Drop everything.","Leave!","Now!","What?","What is it?","Tenzin!","Tenzin, what's happening?!","It doesn't matter.","None of these ideas will work.","The second Zaheer realizes we're up to something, he'll wipe out the airbenders.","Then I'll think you agree that the only plan that will work is for me to give myself up.","I talked it over with Lord Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought.","I have to do this.","The world has been out of balance for far too long: it needs the Air Nation back again.","I can't let Zaheer destroy it and everyone we love.","Help me save the airbenders, then you can worry about saving me.","I'll go radio Zaheer.","Zaheer, are you there?","It's me.","Yes.","You release the airbenders, and then I'll turn myself over.","Yes.","He told me to come to the top of Laghima's Peak at noon, alone.","Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple.","You too.","Don't worry, Dad.","I'll be all right.","I love you, Dad.","And Dad, watch out for Zaheer.","He's not very fond of world leaders.","Mako, did you see the airbenders?","Mako, what's going on?","Tell Ghazan to let the airbenders go.","No!","Wait.","I'm coming.","We had a deal!","Dad!","You.","You killed my father!","No!","The Avatar Cycle.","Dad.","You're alive.","It's great.","Thanks.","You're right.","Okay, let's go.","Is that all you got?","Thanks.","I get that a lot.","I wouldn't know.","Knock yourself out.","Huh?","You again.","No, I-I don't need any help.","Thanks.","That's sweet.","No ...","I appreciate it, but I'll only be gone a couple of weeks.","A little time alone will be good for me.","All right ...","I'll go.","Can you fix it?","That's what I want.","More than anything!","Did you see that?","It worked!","What's the point?","We've been at this for almost six months and I can still ''barely'' take a couple of steps without collapsing!","''Of course'' I'm frustrated!","A crazy man poisoned me and now I can't dress myself, or cook for myself, o-or do ''anything'' for myself!","And this whole time, my friends have been off ''helping'' the world while I'm stuck with you ''and you can't even heal me''!","That came out wrong.","I am trying to understand ''why'' this happened to me, but nothing makes any sense!","I'm tired, Katara.","I'm ''so'' tired.","And ... what am I going to find if I ... get through this?","Yes.","Where'd you come from, little cutie?","How'd you do that?","You want me to follow you?","All right.","Let's see what I find.","It's ''so'' good to see you!","I ''feel'' great!","Come on, I want to show you how much better I'm doing.","Attack!","I can take it!","I thought I was ready.","But that should be ''me ''out there fixing things, not ''her''.","If you say, \"be patient\", I swear I'm gonna water-smack you in the mouth!","Dear Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written to you sooner, but every time I've tried, I never know what to say.","The past two years have been the hardest of my life.","Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State.","I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day.","Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head, so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover.","Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them.","I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff.","I don't think they'd understand.","There's something I need to tell you both.","I want to go back to Republic City.","I know I'm not a hundred percent yet, but I feel like I've hit a wall.","I need to be where the action is, where my friends are.","No, I want to go alone and have some time to clear my head.","It'll be good for me.","Two lobster crabs, please.","Yup, that's me.","Well, uhm, I'm kind of in a hurry.","Hand over the bags or else.","I was hurt pretty bad a while ago and lost touch with my Avatar Spirit.","I came to the Tree of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again.","But it's not working.","The last time I was here, I saw ''all sorts'' of visions.","Now I don't see anything.","I'm sorry, but for years, people have been saying they can help me get better.","Nothing's worked.","I need to figure this out on my own.","I am ending this.","Excuse me.","Who do I talk to about getting in the ring?","Is that all you got?","Why did you bring me to the swamp?","Wait, I met you at the Tree of Time.","You should have told me who you were.","I get your point.","But why did you bring me here?","What am I gonna find in the swamp?","No, wait!","Come back!","You're just in my mind.","You're ''not'' real.","''Help''!","Where am I?","Wha-what happened?","How'd you know I was out there?","A spirit led me here and told me I was supposed to find someone.","Is that you?","Wait, you recognize me?","You got to help me get back into Avatar fighting shape.","I'm getting my butt kicked by losers all over the Earth Kingdom.","The world needs me.","But, while I've been the Avatar, I've stopped some ''really'' bad people from doing some ''really'' bad things.","So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless.","And I thought Beifong was grumpy.","So ... you're not going to train me?","Thank you!","Well, I was thinking that you were ... Gah!","Hey!","It seems like you're enjoying having someone around to beat up an awful lot.","So ... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the world?","That was terrible.","You were tossing me around like a ragdoll all day long.","I just don't understand why I can't get back to my former self.","It's like ...","I'm a step slower.","I'm tentative, I'm out of sync, I just can't get back in the groove.","What metal?","I thought Su got it all out.","That's been my problem this entire time!","I gotta get it out!","You can get it out for me, right?","I am relaxed.","Just do it!","I'm ready.","I'm not fighting!","What do you mean?","Why would I want poison inside me?","Wait!","What am I supposed to do now?","So ... what's the plan for today?","We didn't do anything yesterday, or the day before that.","I know!","Tell me the story of how you taught Aang how to earthbend.","I thought there'd be more to it than that.","What about the time you took down the Fire Lord?","That must have been ''epic''!","Okay, you're terrible at telling stories.","You got it.","No ... this swamp ... it did crazy things to my mind.","I had visions, of all the times my enemies hurt me.","''What''?","You wanted me to see those visions?","You are one ''twisted'' old lady, you know that?","Okay, swamp.","I'm all ears.","I don't know.","Because they made ''me'' and a lot of other people suffer.","Sounds like the swamp is messing with your mind too.","I guess ...","Okay, fine.","But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me.","Maybe you're right, but how am I supposed to move on?","It's beautiful.","I can't believe it!","I saw Jinora, Ikki and Meelo, they're here!","I missed you so much, too.","How did you find me all the way out here?","I'm so sorry.","This is Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki.","Aang and Katara's grandchildren.","I don't know ...","I'm not the Avatar I used to be.","I can't even go into the Avatar State.","All right.","I'm ready.","I feel so much lighter.","Thank you ''so'' much for helping me.","I'd like to give you a hug now, if that's okay with you.","If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I.","She needs to know that the Avatar is back.","The ''world'' needs to know.","Oh, no.","I hope we're not too late.","I'll tell you the whole story later.","Right now, I want to help you stop Kuvira.","What can I do?","How did things get so bad between you and Kuvira?","I thought she was your prot\u00e9g\u00e9.","What happened?","I want to fix this.","Fighting is something the ''old'' me would do.","That always made things worse.","Let me talk with Kuvira.","Maybe I can reason with her.","Well, I'm feeling much better now.","I'm here to ask you to back down.","Please.","Take your army and leave.","I can't let you take Zaofu.","What you're doing isn't right!","I know what that's like.","I've had plenty of people mad at me about decisions I've made.","Maybe that ''will'' be for the best.","Where's Su?","I have to talk to her.","''No!''","We have no idea where your mom is, or what her plan is.","If we go charging into Kuvira's camp, we could get them all captured, or worse.","All we can do now is wait.","No, Jinora is right.","Your mom attacked the camp.","Kuvira was just defending herself.","Jinora and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and, maybe, we can work something out.","I promise, I'll do everything I can to keep the peace.","I can't risk anyone else being captured.","You can stay with Baatar and Huan while I work things out with Kuvira.","Make sure they get back to Tenzin if anything goes wrong.","There must be some way for us to resolve this!","I can't just let you take the city!","It looks like you're not giving me a choice.","Fine.","You wanna fight the Avatar?","Then let's finish this, ''right here, right now.''","Just stay back and let me handle this.","It's been a while, but I got a lot of pent-up rage.","No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort.","Enough talk!","No!","Stay back!","I can handle this.","Naga!","I missed you so much, girl!","It's so great to see you again, Bumi.","And you too, Bum-Ju.","I missed you, Tenzin.","I thought I was strong enough to stop her.","I feel like such a failure.","I hope you haven't been waiting long.","You too.","Thanks.","You're looking snazzy as always.","Hi, Mako.","Nope.","Not a thing.","What?","No!","I wrote to Asami while I was away.","I asked her not to tell you.","I'm sorry.","I don't know.","I guess ...","I didn't know what to say.","I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch, but I'm back now.","And I wanna know everything about what's been going on with you two.","You sure you can trust him?","He might just be manipulating you again.","No, I didn't mean ...","It's not like I planned to be gone for that long, I wanted to come back, but I never felt ready until now.","Do you always go to the bathroom with him?","I'll be right back.","Excuse me, did you happen to see if Prince Wu came out this way?","They've got Wu!","Get the car, I'm going after them!","We're losing them!","Where is he?","Wu's not here.","This guy was the only one in the truck.","They're taking Wu to the train station!","I'll explain on the way, just drive!","We're running out of time!","I learned how to connect to people's energies through them.","Lin's mom.","I found her in the swamp, that place is like one giant spirit wild.","A cranky, more miserable version of Lin.","You'd be surprised.","I don't know!","He's on that train!","I don't.","But I had a feeling, okay?","It's certainly not mine!","Everyone out.","Jump!","Really?","You're asking me out right now?","How about a never?","Not exactly what I imagined for our first day back together.","I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.","There's no place else I'd rather be.","So, what are we gonna do with him?","It's too dangerous to take him back to the hotel.","Mako?","Wow, I-I heard you play on the radio!","So, I was thinking we should spend some time together.","Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other.","Save your breath.","You've already made it clear how you feel about me.","I'm fine.","I'm glad you're here.","I love you, too.","Of course you take his side.","You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.","How could you take his side?","Well, excuse ''me'', officer!","Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets!","I'm just trying to save the world!","So, what?","Are you ... breaking up with me?","Mako, I missed you so much!","Not really.","I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while.","Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.","Was it a bad fight?","Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?","I think we both know that this ... us ... doesn't work.","It's ... over.","For real this time.","You're so sweet.","Thanks.","Sorry.","I've just been thinking about something Toph said.","She told me that the world doesn't need me and it's basically ''pointless'' to try and stop Kuvira.","At the time, I thought so, too.","I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self.","But I'm beginning to think she had a point.","But no matter what I do, the world seems to always be out of balance!","Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar.","I thought I was ''really'' gonna change things.","I was ''so'' naive.","The first time I saw Amon take someone's bending away, I was terrified.","Then my worst nightmare came true.","No!","Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the Spirit and human worlds into chaos.","It was my fault he fused with Vaatu and became a Dark Avatar.","And I was helpless to stop him from destroying Raava and cutting off my connection to my past lives.","With Raava gone, Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever.","Yeah ... that ''was'' pretty awesome.","Yes, ''but'' Zaheer got airbending too and nearly killed me.","If it weren't for Zaheer, the Earth Queen would still be alive.","There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom and Kuvira wouldn't be in power.","Things are more out of balance than ''ever'' now.","Nothing's changed!","I am?","Thank you both.","I know this Kuvira problem is only going to get worse.","But no matter what happens, no matter how ''crazy'' things get, I'll ''always'' try to restore balance.","This place is even more amazing than I imagined!","Korra.","Everything okay?","We ''all'' care.","Don't worry, we'll get them back safely.","Yeah, but it's Ryu.","They might be at the mall, for all we know.","No ... but maybe I can get a reading.","It was Kuvira.","I saw her taking vines from the swamp.","It must be affecting our Spirit Wilds.","I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora.","Whatever the reason, I'm sure it's not good.","You invited ''him'', but not me?","Again, ''him'', not me?!","And let me guess: it has something to do with spirit vines.","I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from the swamp.","We all were.","If ''anyone'' has lost people's trust, it's me.","Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt, no one even wants me around.","We gotta get in there and find Jinora.","I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be, but I can ''do'' this.","Jinora!","Come on!","It's Jinora and the rest of them.","Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World.","Wait ... this isn't the Spirit World.","Zaheer!","No!","No ...","I got it out!","It's Zaheer.","He's been haunting me ever since I fought him.","I can't get any peace.","It's like he's blocking me from meditating into the Spirit World.","I want to face Zaheer.","I ''need'' to if I wanna save Jinora and the others.","There's no other way.","You've lost faith in me, too, haven't you?","No one thinks I'm capable of anything anymore.","I know I can do this.","Tenzin, please.","I'll be okay.","Thank you.","Yes.","I think if I see Zaheer chained up, I'll finally realize that he's not a threat anymore.","No.","I need to do this alone.","I came here to look you in the eye and tell you that you have ''no'' power over me.","I will no longer be scared of you.","This was a mistake.","You don't know anything about me!","''You'' can meditate into the Spirit World from ''here''?","Doesn't feel very spiritually charged.","No, my problem is you!","You poisoned me!","You've ''ruined'' me!","People used to think I was unstoppable, but now they don't think I'm capable of anything!","I thought seeing you face-to-face would put an end to all of this.","But maybe it's time I realize I'll never be the same.","I'm not holding myself down, but my powers have limits!","Whatever.","''Before'', you were always talking about chaos and freedom.","Then you took out the Earth Queen and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen.","''Thanks'' for that!","Well, I ''can't'' stop her unless I get over this block.","No way.","I can't trust you.","I've come this far.","What have I got to lose?","I can't!","I have no control!","I made it ... and ''you'' led me here.","Do you know where Jinora and the others are?","Raava, I missed you.","Where have you been?","Can you help me find Jinora?","How do I release their spirits?","But I'm ''powerless'' in the Spirit World.","I feel ... ''whole'' again.","I feel good.","No.","But I ''am'' finally able to accept what happened and I think that's gonna make me stronger.","''No.''","It was Kuvira's harvesting of the vines in the swamp that caused the Republic City vines to go crazy and grab all those people.","I won't do that.","But maybe since the spirits love Republic City so much, I can convince them to help us defend it somehow.","Excuse me, spirit?","Can I talk to ... and you're gone.","Just like all the other spirits.","They're abandoning the city.","Spirits, this is the Avatar.","Please listen to me.","Since I opened the portals, spirits and humans have lived happily together in Republic City.","It's all I could have hoped for.","I know you felt the effects of Kuvira cutting down spirit vines.","But now isn't the time for you to flee the city.","It's time for you to help me save it from Kuvira, who was perverting spirit power to use as a weapon against other humans.","Spirits worked with Unalaq.","No, but as the Avatar, I'm hoping that you will come to my aid to save the new world we all share.","Wait!","Please, listen.","If spirits and humans are gonna live together, we have to work with each other!","How's the evacuation coming?","Only ''eighteen''?","There are ''millions'' of people in this city!","Su ... what are you ... you're okay!","I'm so sorry about Zaofu.","How did you escape?","Then we'll cut the rail lines.","Don't worry Mr. President.","I won't let Kuvira take our city.","There's something we need to discuss with you.","The four of us have been talking and ... we wanna take out Kuvira's spirit weapon before it gets ''too'' close to the city.","I know Iroh can go toe-to-toe with Kuvira's army, but that weapon ... We'll sneak behind enemy lines and disable the weapon.","It's worth the risk.","We'll head out tonight.","Kuvira.","She's already crossed into United Republic territory.","She's a week early.","It's Kuvira.","Our intel was wrong.","She must have known Zhu Li had the information.","Kuvira's army is only a few hours away.","And that spirit weapon of hers is attached to a giant mecha suit.","It's over twenty-five stories tall!","I'll head to the front lines and help General Iroh.","I'm not surrendering!","I will.","Raiko surrendered.","It's down to us now.","That's it!","Baatar Jr. built it, he'll know how to take it down!","I say we capture him, and get him to talk.","I know it's a long shot, but it's the only chance we have, and if we don't ... We'll need a stealth team of airbenders to get in and out of Baatar's airship unnoticed.","Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai, let's get moving.","Sorry, buddy.","This mission counts on everyone being as silent as possible - - and your farts are just too much of a wild card.","Is everyone ready?","That's why, before she finds out, you're going to tell us how to stop that mecha giant, or else.","We've been going about his all wrong.","You're right.","I'm not gonna physically hurt you if you don't talk.","But there is something I could do that will be even more painful.","I will take away the one thing you care for the most ...","''Kuvira.''","Kuvira might win.","She might chase us out of the city.","But you won't be around to enjoy the victory.","Because wherever I run, I'll take you.","I am going to make it my life's mission to never let you see the one you love again.","Is taking the city worth losing Kuvira forever?","''I will'' ... unless you convince Kuvira to back off.","You two will still have the Earth Empire.","Just leave the United Republic alone.","As soon as we work out terms with Kuvira, we'll let you out of here.","Everyone out!","Now!","''Now!''","I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu.","I'm not letting her conquer Republic City.","The world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.","Lin!","Su, you take Baatar Jr. and the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office.","Get those suits working as soon as you can.","The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own.","Everyone retreat!","Take the wounded back to Asami's office!","You think you know how to defeat this thing?","But how are we supposed to get inside?","We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits.","It looks like they're our only hope.","How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?","Get out there as soon as you can.","Thanks.","We may not be able to beat that thing, but we ''can'' slow it down.","Let's go!","Hiroshi's plan worked.","There's our opening.","We need to move fast.","Su, Lin, climb up to the arm and try to disable that weapon.","Mako, Bolin, get to the engine and see if you can power this thing down.","I'm going after Kuvira.","I know.","She almost destroyed me.","Not this time.","Stop!","Kuvira!","Give up!","Please, stop this madness!","It has to end now!","''Don't!''","Shut it down!","No, we're okay, but we're in the Spirit World.","All the energy from your weapon tore open a new portal and blasted us in here.","I guess ...","I see a lot of myself in you.","You brought this on yourself.","Messing with the spirit vines, acting like a dictator over your people ... you ''had'' to know what you were doing wasn't right.","I think I get it now.","I do.","Su told me how she took

happened?","We heard an explosion.","He must have collapsed the tunnel behind him.","Aiwei is a fugitive.","Get all available guards to search the mountainside, and find out where this tunnel exits

one.","Yeah.","We come up from the valley, scale the side of the mountain and take them off guard.","Korra, no.","How?","Radio the second you see those airbenders.","Go!","Go!","I'm gonna draw her fire.","You take her out.","I love you.","Come and get me, you Third-Eyed Freak!","Release the Avatar.","No!","Stop!","Did he just, fly?","How did you guys make it out of the temple alive?","I'm afraid so.","I wouldn't believe it either if I hadn't seen it for myself.","Not right now, kid!","We need to figure out where Zaheer took Korra.","Was it Ghazan and Ming-Hua?","We need to get to those

chances of you being assassinated are almost zero.","Right ... umm ... yeah, about that ...","I don't know how to tell you this ... you're going to Ba Sing Se ... with the prince.","I tried to get you out of it, but it's over my head.","Wu personally asked Raiko.","He says he doesn't know what he'd do without you.","Not anymore.","You're just a pawn in Raiko's diplomatic game.","You can try talking

closer look.","Uh ... hey, Chief.","He's an actor.","So, you already checked the city for Su?","How did you know she was captured?","It's not his silver tongue, I can tell you that.","Try twenty.","Su

use their earthbending.","Yeah, you're a real sensitive instructor.","Yeah, she's real encouraging.","Just get it over with?","Yeah, let's not linger on the fact that I grew up without a dad.","No need to get all touchy-feely about it.","Just one of those things, right?","Forgave me for what?!","And not knowing my dad is nonsense to you?","It was pretty important to me.","And until now, you

Unalaq.","But unbeknownst to her friends, a dark spirit attacked Korra and dragged her into the ocean.","She has washed up on a desolate island with no memory of who she is.","Avatar Korra has lost her memory!","In order to restore it, she has connected with Wan, who would become the very first Avatar.","Banished from his home, Wan survived for two years in the Spirit Wilds and learned to master fire.","But then, Wan split the spirits of light and dark, Raava and Vaatu, unwittingly plunging the world toward annihilation.","Will he be able to stop him?","Korra has regained her memory.","By connecting with the original Avatar, Korra learned that to stop Unalaq she must close the spirit portal before Harmonic Convergence, which is only weeks away!","Meanwhile, Varrick has made Bolin into a mover star and saved Asami's company.","Mako is the only one who suspects that Varrick is up to no good, but can he prove it?","Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the Northern portal and trapped Jinora in the Spirit World.","Back in Republic City, everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers.","Everybody, that is, except Mako, whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer.","And in the Southern Water Tribe, Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the Civil War, but Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight.","This is unbelievable!","Bolin is bending two full stacks of earth disks at once, which would normally be illegal, but then again, he's fighting three waterbenders, so all rules are out the window!","It's a knockout!","Bolin's a hero.","The mover's star stopped Varrick's kidnapping attempt on President Raiko, proving his brother's innocence.","Mako and Korra were reunited, but Korra has no memory of their break-up.","Meanwhile, Jinora's spirit is still trapped in the Spirit World, and Tonraq and his southern forces have been defeated.","Now it's up to Team Avatar to stop Unalaq before Harmonic Convergence.","After ten thousand years, Harmonic Convergence is here again, and the dark spirit Vaatu is free.","Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya have entered the portal to rescue Jinora's spirit.","Asami split from the group and took the injured Tonraq to safety.","So it's up to Korra, Mako, and Bolin to stop Unalaq before he fuses with Vaatu and becomes a Dark Avatar.","After fusing with Vaatu, Unalaq became a Dark Avatar and ripped Korra and Raava apart!","By destroying Raava, Unalaq and Vaatu transformed into the most powerful dark spirit that's ever lived.","Tenzin managed to free Jinora from the Fog of Lost Souls, but her spiritual quest isn't over yet.","Can anyone save the world from eternal darkness?","It's pandemonium in the streets!","Giant vines are destroying everything.","This is Shiro Shinobi, signing off!","The world has entered a new age.","Harmonic Convergence created an energy shift the likes of which has never been felt before.","And after two weeks, Republic City continues to recover from Korra's epic battle with UnaVaatu.","Vines have sprouted up all over, creating pockets of wilds the spirits have come to call home.","What other changes are in store for our city?","After a hundred and seventy years, there

are after her.","With Tenzin busy with bringing the new recruits to the Northern Air Temple, Korra's protection rests in Beifong's hands.","Lin Beifong has a sister.","After arriving in Zaofu, Korra met Opal, a new airbender whose mother is Lin's estranged half-sister.","Suyin and her daughter welcomed Lin with open arms, but she wanted nothing to do with them.","Meanwhile, Zaheer infiltrated Air Temple Island, looking for the Avatar.","After battling with Kya, he escaped and is now a wanted man in Republic City.","The Air Nation is reborn.","Thanks to the energy shift from Harmonic Convergence, certain people have acquired airbending abilities including Bumi, Kai, and Opal.","Although the new recruits show a lot of promise, they still have a lot to learn.","While Korra remains

up the new skill, and Bolin is hoping to follow in her footsteps.","Meanwhile, the airbender Zaheer is closing in on Zaofu.","By his side are the lavabender Ghazan, the waterbender Ming-Hua, and the combustionbender P'Li.","But what do these mysterious criminals want with the Avatar?","Zaheer infiltrated Zaofu and attempted to kidnap the Avatar.","After a harrowing battle, she was saved and discovered a shocking truth: Aiwei, Su's trusted adviser, has been working with Zaheer.","This truth seer turned traitor managed to escape but Su tasks Team Avatar of tracking him down.","Now the hunted becomes the hunter as Korra searches for answers.","The Red Lotus is the world's newest threat.","After confronting Zaheer, Korra learned that he is part of a secret society whose mission is to

drops out of the sky by tomorrow.","Anyways, the reason I came by was to give you this.","Ta-da!","Uh, oh I can't remember now.","Oh yeah, now I remember.","You saved me from Amon!","Who's this Tarrlok guy?","Is he bothering you?","Huh, 'cause I could have a word with him.","Oh, good.","Good, that sounds better.","I like that better.","Asami crashed into him on her moped.","Hehe, isn't that great?","No Korra for practice again?","Hey, you joined the Fire Ferrets ''before'' you joined his task force.","Okay, we'll check you guys later, you know, we'll see you when we see ya.","So, Korra.","There they go, here we are, all alone in the gym, just you and me, two ''alone'' people.","Together.","Alone.","Work with me here, Pabu!","You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you?","So, what do you think of Korra, in a \"girlfriend\" sort of way?","I was talking about a girlfriend for me!","Leave some ladies for the rest of us!","Well ...?","You just said she was great two seconds ago.","Yeah, yeah, I know, gah.","You know what I'm talking about, Pabu, I'm talking about ''real love''.","That's what I'm talking about!","Thank you, thank you very much!","Thank you all you fans!","So, Korra, I was thinking, you and me, we could get some dinner together, sort of a ''date'' situation.","Are you kidding me?","You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!","I felt that way since the moment I saw you!","Trust me, I know we're gonna have so much fun together.","Yes!","Who's the luckiest guy in the world?","Right here, Bolin!","So, how do you like it?","That's great, 'cause this is my favorite joint.","See?","You love Water Tribe food, I love Water Tribe food, just another reason we are so great together.","That's Tahno and the Wolfbats, the reigning champs, three years running.","Don't make eye contact.","Uh-oh, here he comes.","Now don't mess with this guy, he's a nasty dude.","Korra, don't.","He's just trying to bait you.","If you hit him, we're out of the tournament.","Whoa, ho, ho, I've never seen someone harass Tahno like that.","''You'' are one of a kind, Korra.","What is up with you two?","All right, whatever, just pull together, guys.","I know you usually handle these, but frankly, your head's not in the game.","I'm gonna take this one.","We choose earth.","Don't call me that.","You're not my brother!","You're a brother betrayer!","The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu!","Pabu loves me.","No!","I'm not going anywhere with you, you traitor!","Why?","''You're'' a bad idea!","Put me down!","Put me down!","Hey!","Watch it!","The way we're playing, we don't even deserve to be in the finals.","The sooner, the better.","Owww!","Ahh, it's messed up pretty bad.","But I think I'll be all right.","Are ''we'' gonna be all right?","Me too!","Girls ...","Yes!","She did it!","Ha, ha!","Shoulder!","Shoulder!","That, was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen.","Uh, if everyone's done with the little \"thank you\" party, need some medical attention over here.","Owww!","Gah!","Haven't you hurt me enough, woman?","No, no, oh- ooh!","That's the stuff!","Ahh, I'll be all right.","But we had fun together, didn't we?","Please, go on.","I enjoy praise.","Introducing your new champs, the fantastic Fire Ferrets!","That guy's got some nerve.","You can't!","Beat each other up!","In peace!","It's an inspiration to everyone!","Yes, exactly what she said!","Yes!","All right!","Now I know there's a big crowd but don't be nervous.","You're gonna do great, I believe in you.","You're on, Pabu.","Yes!","Nailed it!","He's so talented!","Pfft, they got nothing on us, buddy.","Anybody can howl.","Hm, whatever.","That's the stuff.","You are my herooo-ah!","Pabu!","Listen up, buddy.","I'm not!","I'm trying to save us!","See?","Pabu's not just a one trick poodle pony.","It's okay, Pabu.","Just a little explosion.","Keep chewing, you're almost through it!","Yes!","Great job, buddy!","Me too!","Yeah.","We had some good memories here, didn't we?","Earthbending bomb!","Welcome to paradise!","''This'' is the greatest place in the world!","Watch this, watch this.","Fetch me my towel, good sir.","Master Bolin!","Ha, I love this guy.","Now pat me dry.","Don't forget Master Pabu.","Emergency, emergency coming through, beep beep!","Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?","What was that?","Yeah, just stay put until the chief comes back.","That's sounds very familiar doesn't it, why?","Because you said it.","Oh no.","Hello, Mr. Sato.","Wow!","What a really swell, scary factory you have here under your giant mansion.","I have a couple of questions.","Is this an all vegetarian island?","Is that where you train airbending?","Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes?","Do we each get our own sky bison?","And final question, how many trees are on this island?","I'm a boy!","Korraaa!","And he wasn't alone.","He had his friends to help him.","Look, the arena might be shut down but we're still a team.","The ''new'' Team Avatar!","Get ready, Republic City.","You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar.","Naga away!","Chi blockers!","I call front!","We'll be all right.","Cover your ears!","I can't go with you listening.","Ahh!","A little privacy, please!","Thanks for catching that.","Then where do we start?","Yeah!","Yeah, that makes sense!","When those chi blockers had me in their truck, it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!","Hmm.","This way kinda ... smells familiar.","Yeah, we all are!","W-What?","No!","That's, just gossip, where'd you hear that?","Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now.","Heh ...","Nothing!","I mean, there was this one time during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but- Believe me, I was upset too, but, I'm over it.","I don't think it meant anything.","Let's go, people!","Try to chi block that, fools!","Ughh!","Man!","I had this awful dream that Korra was taken by this evil bloodbender.","So weird.","Are you serious?","Where is he?","Is he here right now?","All things considered you did a great job!","But how are we going to pay for all these parking tickets?","Car!","Oh, we're good.","Mustache guy!","You are a wise and noble hobo.","''Mmmm.''","This is the best-tasting street gruel I've ever had.","Seriously!","Whoops!","Where does Hiroshi find the time to keep inventing new evil machines?!","No matter what our plan is, he always has a better one.","I like this man's confidence!","So, how are we not out of the fight?","Love you back, big bro.","Korra, Amon is a nasty dude.","Be careful.","Aye aye, captain!","Ooh, general, general.","All right, you guys wait here until we get back, okay?","Uh-uh, stay.","That is a negative, Sir.","Naga!","Over here!","Who needs a metalbender?","We got Naga!","Yeah!","Ahh!","No, Naga!","Whoa!","Thanks Naga.","Mr. Sato, you are a horrible father!","Hey, at least you unlocked your airbending!","Right, right, I'll just stand over here quietly, in silence.","Where's Mako when I need him?","Wow!","Look at all these people that came out to greet us.","Whoa!","Who are the lovely ladies?","What?","Oh, it's so good.","You looked like you were just sitting on a pillow.","Uh ... no?","Yeah.","Is that how business usually goes?","Wish me luck.","I'm making my move!","Whee!","Hey, I'm Bolin.","I'm a friend of Korra's!","You're, uh, Eska right?","Wow, I'm just, I am loving these robes.","So, you are from the north right?","Cool, that's, like you know, that's my favorite direction.","You mean like a boyfriend, or like a slave ...?","Uh, What's going on?","Got it!","Don't got it!","Guys!","Hey, wait for me!","Check it out, I'm traveling in style!","Okay, uh, sorry, still getting used to that throttle.","Sure does.","But, uh ... who's gonna drive?","Go away, Mako.","What are those?","Can we not talk about dark spirits, please?","Thank you.","Whoa, so ''you'' were supposed to be chief, then ''he'' became chief.","No wonder you guys don't like each other.","Ow!","What?","Isn't that what happened?","Is that what I think it is?","Oh man, I really don't like this.","Oh, it's in the engine!","Aaaahhhhh!","Aaaahhhhh!","I can't stop it!","I'm a raft!","Uhhh, can someone please deflate me?","Thank you.","Yeah!","If she goes, we go, too!","It's beautiful.","Hey, Korra, you're back.","Hey, Korra's back!","Yes, dear.","So-so funny.","You know, I'll be ''really'' sad when you have to leave.","It's been ''really'' great getting to know you.","''Really.''","Mako!","I'm so happy to see you!","No!","No, I'm not all right.","I can't take anymore.","Listen, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska!","Don't make me.","Oh, please, please don't make me.","Break up with her?","You can do that?","How?","Oh, no, no, I don't think she'd like that.","Thanks, Mako.","Whew.","I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts.","Ha, Korra better watch out.","Oooh, no, it's just a-, uh, you kn-, uh, never mind.","Isn't this fun, huh?","We never get to spend enough time together, just the ... five of us.","So fun.","You guys gotta save me.","I tried!","But anytime I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin piranhas!","Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off.","Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands.","No, no, not to me it wasn't.","I'm very bad at reading people.","You should know that by now.","Oh, man.","Oh!","Do something, Avatar!","Would you relax?","This place is great.","And the best part about it, Eska doesn't know I'm here.","Ee-yah.","I wasn't hiding.","Hey, hey-hey, hey.","Yeah, he's a cop.","Yes, yes, my sweet koala otter.","I tried to break up with her, but ''Mako'' gave me terrible advice.","Thank you, Mako.","Varrick?","Wow!","What's the money for?","I think I catch your drift, Varrick-bear.","We're good to go.","I gave all the money to some guys over there.","I told them to \"take care of it\", and then I winked.","Pretty sure they got the message.","Man!","I should have paid him!","Objection!","Your honor, if I may?","May I ... declare a mistrial?","Hey there, Eska, I was wondering if we could talk.","Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you.","You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark.","But I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading.","Oh!","Oh, yes!","I'm so glad you understand!","Oh, no, I can't - This is really tight.","No, no, the honesty thing worked out great.","So great she decided we should get married!","I guess ''Eska'' didn't get the memo.","Uh, you fellas seen a traveling circus come through here?","Where's your dad?","I really need to thank you, Korra.","Exactly!","Now Eska and I are officially broken up.","''That'' would be my darling Eska.","Quick question: is this thing fast enough to get away from my crazy waterbending ex-girlfriend?","So, um, what should I be doing?","Sure, I live here.","Y- no?","Wow.","Usually, when I see flashing lights like this, it's because I got hit in the head with a rock.","Well, I took a trip South for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war ...","But there's nowhere I'd rather be than pro-bending night in Republic City!","Am I right, people?","Republic City!","The trick is, whenever I get confused, I just say \"Republic City\" or \"fans\", and then everyone cheers.","Sorry I ever doubted you.","Don't freak out.","It's not real.","Ahhh!","Sorry.","I keep doing that.","I'm Nuktuk!","What do you think?","Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today.","That guy is a genius.","He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing.","And he's gonna put me in the movers as this hero, Nuktuk!","He's a man of action, but he's got a heart of gold.","He was born in the tundra.","Oh.","Oh, sorry.","Uh, sure.","What is it?","Glad I could help.","Nuktuk saves the day again!","Wouldn't I be ''cold'' wearing this outfit in the snow?","Ohhh.","Hey, Ginger.","Where are you going?","And Mako.","What?","There's no way Mako would have told.","Right?","I- is this a trick question?","Uh ... not that I can recall.","Right ... Wow.","We got some major chemistry on-screen.","Am I right?","What's wrong?","Are you mad because I left you in the clutches of the evil Unalaq?","I'm gonna save you in the next episode.","Ginger, let's work through this.","Hey, Mako, what do you think?","I did a little redecorating.","It turns out that one of the perks of being a star, you get lots of cash.","It's also a hat rack.","That's because we never ''had'' a hat rack.","And now we do.","Mako, you seem stressed.","I think ''you'' need to take a little dipity dip.","You need my help?","I don't know.","I'm kinda busy.","I'm maintaining my instrument.","As an actor, my ''body'' is my instrument.","You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life.","I don't know, Mako.","Figure it out.","Remember?","That's what you said to me.","Hurts, doesn't it?","Ow!","My instrument!","Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment.","It just felts so right.","So ... that kiss.","I liked it.","And it seemed like you liked it too.","Okay, okay, I'm sorry.","I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now.","It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not.","But Nuktuk ''is'' Bolin.","I'm a hero.","Yes?","Oh, hello, Mako.","Didn't notice you there.","Hmm.","Can't say that I've seen him.","But I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene.","There's gonna be some crazy \"pyrotechnics\".","That's mover speak for explosions.","Or sometimes we just call them explosions.","Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene.","Hello?","Anyone?","Nuktuk's still up here, all alone.","Asami!","Hey, what are you doing here?","Right now?","Nope.","We're uh ... we're at lunch.","Up here.","Ahh!","Ow, aww.","Oh, I got to stop doing my own ''stunts''.","What?","No.","See, this is why I had to move out.","Nope.","It was time for this eagle hawk to spread his wings and fly.","Korra just left a week ago!","Hey, Mako.","I'm on my way to the big finale for \"Nuktuk: Hero of the South.\"","Yeah, everyone's gonna be there except for, you know, you ... because you're in jail and stuff.","Hey, I brought you something.","I thought this would brighten up your new place.","Read the inscription.","No, I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement.","I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you.","We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal.","Of course ''I'' know that, but you do kinda look like one, cause you're in a jail and that's where criminals live.","Ah, I see what you're doing.","You're going for the insanity defense.","Smart.","That's not what Shiro said!","I just wish Mako was here to see it.","Of course I know.","Juji's fine.","He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth.","Oops.","Spoiler.","Sorry.","I guess I just miss my friends.","Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around.","Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing ... business-lady stuff.","Team Avatar's fallen apart.","You go ahead.","I need another another minute.","That's weird.","I don't think so.","Mister President, get back, I'm here to help.","Looks like there's no where to go.","Tell me who sent you!","Boyfriend?","Wait, stop.","I thought you said we ''weren't'' a couple.","Yeah!","Oh, you meant right now.","Unalaq is going to destroy the world?","He really does have a doomsday device?","Sir, Nuktuk needs your help.","I know you love helping people.","Never should have saved that guy.","Yeah, me too.","I saved the president, in real life!","You were right about Varrick.","He tried to kidnap Raiko!","But it didn't work, because of you, and because of me.","Let's just say we both did good.","Beifong says you're free to go.","Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako.","Oh yeah, did I forget to tell you?","Korra's back.","I think I know just the man to talk to.","Well we're gonna end it.","Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?","You named your battleship after your assistant?","All right!","Team Avatar is back in business.","Haha!","It's a Varrick ship, you never know what you're gonna find.","There's a whole level filled with fun-house mirrors.","Of course, there's also the catgator deck.","I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting.","So, have you told Korra yet about how you guys broke up, and you kinda started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?","Oh Mako, you know a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech: you just have to do it fast and get it over with.","Are we almost there?","A suicide mission ...","I'm an earthbender, strapped to the wing of a plane, hundreds of feet in the air, so, no?","I think they were expecting it!","Asami!","I wish Varrick was filming this!","We could call it \"Nuktuk: Sky Warrior\"!","Wait a second.","Worst-case scenario: so we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals and let's just say ''something'' happens to you.","Are we going to be trapped in there for eternity?","We're on it.","I don't know if we can win this fight.","Unalaq?","Are you out there?","He must've gone home?","I'm sorry, I can't help it.","It's just so sad that I'll never be with you again.","Eska, I've always loved you.","And I always wanted to be with you.","But now that the world is ending, I'm never gonna get that chance.","No, I was scared.","I was scared of my true feelings for you.","Gah, I should have never left you.","I'm sorry.","And I'm sorry that we'll never have the chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a ''big'' fire of love flames.","Yeah right, huh.","That was acting.","He's got the Light Spirit!","No.","I am too young to live through ten thousand years of darkness.","Korra, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?","Eska!","I love you!","Let's face the end of the world together!","And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow!","I just wished Varrick was here to film it!","It would be the greatest mover ever.","After the Nuktuk chronicles of course.","So, I was thinking.","I'm not really a fan of a long-distance relationship thing, so how about you move to Republic City with me.","Okay.","Desna can come too.","But you said- Yeah.","I guess I did too.","You want a hug?","Bumi says he airbended earlier, but he can't now.","Oh, and I guess he's not very good at knitting either.","I gotta say, I ''love'' being a part of this family.","You got the grumpy dad, the wacky uncle, the put-upon mom, ''crazy'' kids.","Well, that's just great.","Oh, you mean the brooding teenager?","He's staying in the police station.","I told him Tenzin invited us to stay here since our apartment is a vine habitat now, but, he said he had to focus on work.","Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.","I think that could've gone better.","Mako called!","The cops found a new airbender guy, but when they tried to bring him in, he ran away and climbed to the top of Kyoshi Bridge and won't come down.","Ooh sorry, did I interrupt an Avatar wisdom session?","Oh okay.","Is that a good thing?","Mako, wait a sec.","A life?","You sleep under your desk.","And what's a more important job than helping the Avatar rebuild an entire civilization?","Well, drift back, we need you!","C'mon Mako, we're going to Ba Sing Se, where Dad grew up.","What if I meet our grandma for the very first time, and she asks me \"Where's your sweet brother?\"","and I have to say \"I'm sorry, Grandma, he had some really important police paperwork to file\" and she starts to cry those grandma tears, and is like \"Mako!","Why?","Why?","I can't go on, I ca--\" and then she dies.","No worries!","I love pie.","And so does Pabu.","Or we could have thrown him in a potato sack and forced him into the ship.","So nice to meet you!","Good luck with your son!","Yeah, razzle-dazzle!","We could put on some sort of airbending street performance!","Yes!","That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear!","Come one, come all to witness The Amazing Airbenders!","The airbending show that will leave you breathless ... with wind!","First up, the tattooed master himself, you know him as the son of Avatar Aang, he shaves every hair on his head, every single day!","It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose, Tenzin!","Now, now, ladies and gentleman, ladies and gentleman, please be quiet.","I have some serious news.","We've heard that an escaped firebending convict has been spotted near here.","Now, I don't want to panic anyone, but if you see a firebender with a red scarf- Oh no!","Who will help us?","With the power of airbending, even this beast can float!","Like a feather.","Look what can be done in only a few short weeks of practice!","No no, don't worry folks.","She might be young, but she is in full control!","Ladies and gentlemen, if you, or anyone you know is an airbender, please, send them our way!","Master Tenzin and Avatar Korra would love to teach them all they know!","Get outta town!","This is going to be so great!","You going to love it, er ... ah ... real quick, what's your name?","You're an orphan?","Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore, right guys?","Tell him.","When you board this airship, you're going to leave your old life behind and start a new path.","That's big brother advice.","Just think of me as your big brother.","Are, are you taking him back to the orphanage?","Welcome to the family, little bro.","This is it, Mako!","We made it!","This is where Dad grew up!","Come here!","Look, look!","Yeah, I can smell it from here.","No wonder Dad left.","Hello, Middle Ring!","Aah, it's got that Upper Ring smell.","Well, I can just stash Pabu in my shirt, these two are going to be a little tougher.","Ooh, very swanky.","But he's my new little brother.","He's probably lost, and scared.","Kai, did you go fishing?","You under the bridge?","Kai, it's us.","Mako and Bolin, your new family.","Excuse me, coming through Pardon me.","Carry on.","Yeah ... just a lovable little scamp, isn't he?","We can pay, hold on.","Where's my money?","No, Kai wouldn't-- Aww, man.","The bad news is we're stuck here.","The good news is we can go the bathroom wherever we want.","Ohh man, aww I slipped a disc sleeping here.","It's been awhile since we spent the night in a trash pile.","It's about how I remembered.","Fwoo, I'm getting really hungry.","Haah, we might have to hustle up a little breakfast with the old, fruit stand scam.","Come on.","You remember how it goes, I push you into the stand, you scream.","I pretend to faint.","I'm confused.","Are we stealing the fruit or not?","Yeah, I mean I'm famous so I get that, but how do you know his name?","Yeah, they're not really comedies, but uh ... Oh, Mako and I grew up on the streets.","We were homeless, then we were kinda in a gang, then we lived in a gym ...","Wait, you mean you don't know?","This is so great!","We never had a family before.","Now we've got one, two, five ... eleven ... ... a big family!","Yeah!","Look, Mako!","Dad's wearing your scarf!","What?","What happened?","I hope Kai is okay.","Awesome!","Tu, you're the best cousin that I can have.","And my other cousins as well.","Yeah.","Yeah, you're all the best.","I love you too, Grandma.","And Chow, and Tu, and Meng-Meng, and Chow Jr., there is Big Tee and Little Tee, and Medium Yu, and ... and ... and what was your name again?","We chased Kai.","Train.","Slipped away.","Lower Ring.","Slept in trash pile.","Met our family.","Grandma tears.","Mako scarf.","Earth Queen.","Lying.","Quick!","Pabu.","Shirt.","I know.","Sorry.","Kinda sweaty.","I'm on it!","What?","Hey, I'm not sweaty this time!","Whoa!","Tenzin's not gonna be happy about this!","How can I not?","This is too juicy!","We can't stay mad at you.","We need help!","Everybody, hang on.","Wow!","Wow!","Wow!","An entire city made of metal!","Wohoho, you should feel right at home, Beifong.","Yeah!","Does Toph live here?","Are we going to get to meet her?","Oh ... Wow, that's a really nice ... banana?","Yes, very, very lifelike.","Oh, yeah, no, uh, I can, I can totally see that.","I can, oh, let me stand here.","Yes, I can see that now.","Yes.","Thank you.","Banana.","I mean, that's a banana right?","Opal.","That's a beautiful name.","I'm Bolin.","Mmmm.","I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical when he said \"pea tendrils\", but this is delicious.","Oh.","I had plenty when Mako and I were living in the streets.","I mean, you'd be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be.","No, no, it's okay, that's all in the past.","Things are great now.","I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, became ''a mover star'', and now, I'm helping the Avatar rebuild a whole nation.","Varrick!","Yeah, I know.","She's sweet and pretty and super nice.","Too bad she's not my type.","You know, that really hurts a little bit.","Right ... here.","Maybe you're right, bro.","Maybe Opal is Bolin material.","Thanks.","Yeah!","Hey, lady.","Wow, you really blowin' me away with your ''airbending''.","Ahhh, woo-woosh, psst.","Why are ''you'' acting weird?","Look, I'm sorry.","I just get really self-conscious when I know when a girl likes me, and I-I end up looking stupid.","Oh no.","But I though ...

Opal ... What?","What's going on?","Pabu, sleep!","Huh?","What?","Oh, Pabu.","It's not play time right now.","Okay, we are seriously going to have to have a talk- What the heck?!","They've got Korra.","They've got Korra!","No way!","That guy is lavabending!","That's awesome ... ly not good for us.","I can?","I do?","All right.","Bolin time.","Bolin time!","I can't get a clean shot!","What?","Hey, Varrick.","What are you doing here?","But for who?","He's not home.","Or he's hiding in there.","Or he's invisible.","Probably just not home.","Hmm, it's like a desert on a jar.","Could be a storage cellar.","We do.","We do.","We actually knocked on your front door and we thought we heard you say, 'Come in, I'm in the bathroom!'","I don't even know why I'm saying that.","You know I'm lying, and you don't even sound like that.","But you said - Ohh look, they have a mover poster of me.","Must be big Nuktuk fans, yeah, I should go out and say hello ...","Yes!","I love it when you talk like a cop.","Ooh, Mako, Mako, Mako!","We should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover!","That way, no one will recognize us.","Haha, police work is so exciting!","All right, now we need our undercover identities!","I'm an ex-United Forces operative named Ting-Ting.","War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is.","Tragically, she was taken from me by my archenemy Dr. Razor and - But I haven't even told your backstory.","Uh!","You're good at this.","And he's got this weird piercing that goes from his nose to his ear.","Freaks me out.","Well, aren't you a cute little spir- Ow!","Hey!","I think there might be a couple bounty hunters over there who recognize me!","We could, or ... we could follow Aiwei instead.","Look!","Ting-Ting always finds his man.","Uh, I'd be happy to.","Always love meeting my fans.","Uh, it's ... cute.","I'd just like to say, for the record, this room is definitely not perfect.","Naga!","I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting.","This isn't.","At all!","Ooh, I wonder if there's any snacks in here.","Hey, look!","A Pai Sho board!","Mako, you want to play?","Oh, well, ugh, no offense but I learned street Pai Sho from Shady Shin, and I'm pretty good.","So, wouldn't really be a fair game.","Well, looks we've got ourselves a Pai-Shodown.","Ladies first.","Uh, I don't mean to rush you, but let's speed things up a bit.","No, it's not.","This is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, game of chance!","Don't think.","Just go.","Oh really?","I think Mr. Rulebook might disagree with you.","The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years.","It is a game of both strategy and chance.","Wait, how can it be both?","That's no help at all.","Korra, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules.","That's cool.","Whenever you get to it.","That's just like Pai Sho!","In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to ''know'' your opponent.","What?","Ugh.","All right, you know what that was just a fluke.","Best two out of three.","Oh, come on!","Best four out of seven.","Eight out of fifteen.","Seventeen out of thirty-three?","Ha, ha!","Looks like you're on the ropes this time.","No, Pabu?","Why?","That's a weird way to nap.","Korra, come on!","Wake up!","I can't beat this guy!","It's like I'm giving him ammo!","Want to trade?","So you guys were like locked up for fifteen years, ''huh''?","It must've been like crazy boring.","I mean, what did you do with all that time?","Did you sing songs, work on crafts?","Ooh okay, that sounds like fun.","Let me try that on you guys.","''You'' were raised by an older sister, your mustache grew in when you were ten and I'm sensing - just sensing - an unspoken attraction between you two.","Sorry!","Four years?","No.","I appreciate that, Mako, and fellow ... prisoner man.","But I've been trying and trying and trying and I've never been able to do it.","Not even a little.","You're right.","Okay, here I go.","Metalbending.","I can't metalbend.","You said before \"was my time\".","Did you see that?","I did it!","I mean, not for us, but I metalbent all the other cells open!","Should we do something?","Right.","Okay, find Korra, deliver message.","Yeah, this should be easy.","We just got to get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast expansive wasteland that goes on for thousands, and thousands, of miles.","This isn't gonna be easy.","Some folks just do not have respect for other people's property.","Now let's steal this airship!","Technically speaking, no.","But, c'mon, how hard could it be?","I don't see any up button.","I see levers and switches, oh, there it is.","Mako, our family's down there.","Oh, you think just because you dated Asami, you know how to fly this better than me?","I came to get you guys out.","This whole block is about to go up in flames.","Come on, Mako and I have an airship on the roof.","Grandma, we don't have time for tea.","Grandma, there's one thing Mako and I've learned from all our years on the street.","It doesn't matter where you go.","If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home.","Fine!","You leave me no choice.","We're rolling out!","I don't know.","But there's some tracks.","See, I told you.","Landing is hard.","Okay, guys.","We think Korra found her way back here.","Now let's split off into teams and scour the town.","Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu, now just give me a second while I- wait, Pabu?","Pabu!","I'm never gonna let you go again!","Asami!","Korra!","Oh my gosh, it's Lord Zuko!","I can't believe it.","Because he wanted us to find you and deliver a message.","I guess, in the meantime, Mako and I will stay here and try to get through to the temple.","I told you, it's Bolin!","No!","I'm not looking for Bolin, I ''am'' Bolin!","Gah, look, I need you to find your dad.","No, a whole herd?","Really?","Wait, I've got it.","I'll disguise myself as a lost hiker, and once I'm in the temple, I'll distract the Red Lotus with my bird calls.","That's when you all strike.","Well I haven't noticed you offering any suggestions.","I'm just worried about Opal, and Pabu's not here to comfort me.","I hope he and Naga are doing okay back in Zaofu.","Oh, man.","Not gonna happen.","The exit's blocked.","On it!","Is it just me, or is it uh, getting really warm in here?","Oh, this is not good.","Let's move it, people!","We can't outrun it!","This way.","I know.","I just found out.","You're right.","Being moments from death was a pretty good motivator too.","Of course, we would have never made it back with Kai.","Are you sure?","Me too.","Look out!","What are you smiling about?","Well, a lot has changed since then.","Give up, Ghazan!","You can't win.","Mako, hang on!","See what I did there?","I put a sock in him, literally.","I do what I do.","We just got some good news.","Two more Earth Kingdom states have agreed to join us.","Kai!","''Wow'', you are a lot heavier than you used to be.","You're really growing up.","Hey, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent and professional.","Opal, I can't believe you're here too!","I missed you so much.","Isn't that great, sweetie?","What happened?","I guess ...","I got to go.","I'm not!","I wanna help, but if the Governor wants us gone, there's ... there's nothing I can do.","I'm sorry.","Hey ... Opal, please.","Now don't take this the wrong way, but, I can't wait for you to leave!","Don't forget to write!","You will be most pleased to learn that I found gainful employment with Sir Varrick and the Lady Kuvira.","I set off on the morrow with some trepidation, but I am eager to offer any aid I can in stabilizing the Earth Kingdom!","Hello Republic Cit-ay!","Bolin ... is back!","And ... Eska is also here.","Oh no no, that's Kuvira, she's kind of my boss.","I know, right?","I see myself in the mirror sometimes and I think I'm in trouble before I realize: it's only me.","So, have you seen Korra yet?","Were you surprised?","Because I was ''really'' surprised.","Won't this turn all the world leaders against us?","Yeah, well, I just have some misgivings about how you kind of ambushed Tenzin and the other leaders.","I do, but ...","I'm just not sure about this whole \"Empire\" thing.","It seems pretty aggressive.","And what was that part about the crushing?","I'll stand by you.","Interesting ceremony, huh?","You don't understand.","Kuvira is helping out all the poor people of the Earth Empire.","People like our family.","This is for the best.","Okay, why don't you come with me, and you'll see for yourself?","We've done a lot of good, and Varrick is working on some new innovations.","We're making ''history''.","''That'' was just some tough rhetoric to let the people know that we mean business.","I mean, Kuvira is basically just like Korra.","She might seem hard to deal with, but just because she's so passionate and believes in what she's doing.","Oh, okay, you think your new best friend in there would be a better leader than Kuvira?","Still what?","Come on, Mako!","I'm making a difference out there, what are you doing, huh?","You're just some glorified butler for some snotty rich bozo!","'''Fine'''!","I'm going to go back to my awesome train, where we bring ''freedom'' where ever we go!","Enjoy licking the king's boots in your ''junior suite!''","Am ...","I in trouble?","I can do that!","By the time I'm finished telling her all the great things we've done, she'll be begging to join!","Aren't all these troops gonna send the wrong message?","Opal!","You're here, too!","''Sides?''","There shouldn't be sides!","I know, why don't we all stand in a circle, huh?","Maybe hold hands?","Okay, guys, obviously, there's a lot of personal, painful history here, so what do you say we just all forget about that stuff, huh?","I mean, that's the past!","Right Wing?","Right Wei?","You guys know what I'm talkin' 'bout, right?","High five!","All right.","No, that's cool.","You know what I think we need to do?","Focus on the future!","And the future is bright, let me tell you!","I've seen it!","Yeah!","Saw it last month!","We went to this town that had ''nothing.''","Most of the people there had never seen a Satomobile before.","Now, they have ''two'' Satomobiles, running water, and a magnet train that goes right through their town!","I mean, how awesome is ''that''?","You're wrong, Opal!","Now, I don't know what you think you've seen, but I am giving you the one-hundred-percent Bolin guarantee that we're making the Earth Empire a better place to live!","You were just bluffing, right?","I mean, you're not really gonna attack Zaofu ... are you?","''Other'' ... ways?","How many ... times have we used these \"other ways\" in the past?","So, uh ... what ''does'' happen to all those towns and villages after we leave?","I just realized I'd never really ... gone back and ... checked on them.","Maybe ...","I'm not really an \"inner circle\" kind of guy.","Or--or maybe, we don't take over Zaofu!","Maybe we can just--let them be on their own, and then, \"Yay!","The Empire's united!","Congratulations to us!\"","I ... thought that's where we sent people to learn new trade skills.","No--no, I'm totally on your side, completely, one-hundred-percent loyal.","Varrick?","Varrick?!","Well, there's something important I gotta tell you, too!","How'd you find out?","She threatened me, too!","And she's threatening Zaofu and it turns out, she's been threatening villages this whole time!","We gotta get outta here.","Okay, I say we go up and around the mountains-- --and sneak into Zaofu from the rear.","What?","No, nonono, we gotta help ''here''.","Well, that's helping, but it's a completely different type of helping.","''Hmm''.","Let me think about this.","Don't ... torture us.","What's goin' on?","Wait, what?","I need my hands!","Uh, hold on!","Can we have breakfast first?","While we still have hands?","What thing?","I'm not Zhu Li, okay?","Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here, also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands ''blown off!''","Clean energy!","Sounds ''great''!","Who doesn't like that stuff?","Let's do ''that'' instead!","Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them, you know this isn't right.","What?!","What bomb?","Nononono!","I'm not ready to go down with the ship, ''or the train''!","That's everyone, our half of the train is clear.","Man, that was great!","I gotta admit, you had me going there for a while, I really thought you were gonna blow us up!","Now, how do we turn this thing off?","What are you talking about, \"a good run\"?","I'm still running!","I like running!","I want you to know, ''I hate you''.","I can't ''believe'' Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did.","How about you use your own legs for a while?","Well, Zhu Li's not here, okay?","No way mister!","You're not getting off that easily.","You're responsible for that weapon Kuvira is trying to make.","Which, may I remind you, could hurt a lot of people.","Okay, look.","Kuvira fooled us both into doing her dirty work and I'm not happy about it either.","''But'', you know how we're gonna make it up to the world?","By getting back to Republic City and warning everyone what she's up to!","So, I want you to take my hand and march with me out of this forest!","Oh, great, my feet could use a break.","Are you ''kidding'' me?!","I wish Pabu were here.","He could just chew us out of this.","Hello fellow travelers!","I don't suppose you can help us out of this net?","Were, not anymore!","Please, just, let us out!","So how did a bunch of water and firebenders end up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps?","Purging?!","No, I swear!","And the inner circle thing lasted like, less than a day!","Look, I'm sorry for what happened to all of you, but as I've been trying to explain, we don't work for Kuvira anymore.","All right, where is this checkpoint?","Follow my lead.","You sure can.","We captured these escaped prisoners.","We need to get them to a secure facility.","Camp fourteen.","You think we don't know where Camp fourteen is?","''Kuvira'' wants them transferred.","Varrick, wait, we can't leave them!","Yeah.","I kind of did.","Let's go!","I know it might not mean much coming from a guy wearing this uniform, but I'd like to apologize for what Kuvira's put you through.","Guess this is where we part ways.","Come on, I want you to meet my brother, Mako.","Ooh!","Giant pillow!","Oh, come on!","I wasn't singing, ''you'' were not levitating, and Asami is just a friend, thank you very much.","If you want to tell my true story, you should start from when I met Korra.","She came to the bending arena, one fateful night ... Name's Bolin, by the way.","There wasn't any singing!","Wait!","Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu.","How would that even happen?","Oooh, ''now'' the story's getting interesting.","''Opal'', so smart and caring, so pretty to smell, and she'll probably never talk to me again because I'm so stupid!","''Stupid''!","So, so, so stupid.","Okay, that part seems a little unbelievable.","Wait!","You ''like'' that?","It didn't make any sense!","What about Zombie Amon?","What happened to him, ''huh''?","And-and-and-and ''stars'' are magic fairy dust?","Are you guys crazy?","Are you crazy?","Guys!","Oh, perfect!","You're all here.","Listen to me.","Kuvira's making this thing that goes I don't know how it works, but it has this I know, I know.","I didn't listen to you, and I sided with Kuvira, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom, and topple your home, and get your mom captured, and your brothers, and your dad ... Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that.","But I'm gonna make it up to you.","Thanks, guys.","Mako, I'm ''so'' sorry about the way we left things.","I'm such an idiot.","You tried to warn me about Kuvira and I ran off anyway, like an idiot.","You were right and I'm ''just'' an ''idiot''.","I hope ... that ...","I'll be able to earn your trust again.","Aww, I love you guys.","And I really wanna hug again.","Opal, you made it!","A picnic, just for the two of us!","Well, the three of us.","Sorry, Pabs.","Where are you going?","All right, listen.","Before you go, I just want to tell you that I understand how you feel.","I know there is nothing I could do or no big gesture that could make up for all my mistakes, ''but'' that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying to win you back because ...","I love you.","What is it?","Yes, I'll do anything!","Where to?","All right, let's do this!","Saving the Beifongs and saving our love, because I vow to repair the rift that has grown betwixt us and make us whole again!","Yes, ma'am.","Oh, man!","Ohh, I can't.","This can't be happening!","No ... well, now, maybe.","You're my hero!","My name is Bolin.","I'm dating your granddaughter, I mean, kind of.","I may have screwed that up, but that's why I'm here and you're my hero!","Oh, I said that.","Can I have a hug too?","Sure, okay, makes sense.","There's a factory and reeducation facility not too far away.","\"Used to\"!","Please tell me this attitude isn't hereditary.","So how long as it been since you two have seen each other?","Okay, there's the factory.","Whoa, that's one big ... thing.","Someone's coming.","Hide!","Or at least destroy the cannon.","If she takes that to Republic City, it could obliterate everything.","Hmm.","Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then.","That's our best chance to sneak in and free Su without being spotted.","Thanks.","I kind of have a headache now.","So let me ask you about metalbending.","Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it.","I did learn how to lavabend.","I can't believe ... you think I'm talented?","That means so much to me coming from my hero.","So here's something I've always been curious about: Who's Lin's dad?","And ... okay.","I got you!","We got 'em.","We're coming out.","What?","No, I have to go save her.","We've been through too much together.","I can't leave her.","Toph, you said Zhu Li was lying about fixing the cannon.","She must have been trying to stop it.","No, Zhu Li doesn't make mistakes.","You guys leave.","If we make it out, we'll make it to the city somehow.","You know, I never had any family except for my brother until a few years ago, and reuniting with them made me realize how special it is.''","Yes!","Guys!","Good, you're all here!","Opal, Beifong, and I rescued everyone.","But we had a run in with Kuvira.","We saw her super spirit weapon up close.","Like, ''really'' close.","''Way'' too close.","Ooh!","And Zhu Li's on our side now.","Actually, she never really switched sides and I'm just gonna let her explain the whole thing.","Zhu Li?","Varrick!","Good, you're here.","Can I talk to you for a minute?","Well, I went to Zaofu and saved Su and her family ... and guess who else we found?","Ha!","Now, isn't there something you wanted to say to her?","Hmm?","It's too powerful!","It can destroy the city.","Guys!","I see something.","Down there!","Oh, did I forget to mention it?","No, of course I didn't know!","I know what happens next!","We gotta get out of here, now!","Now!","What should we do?","How are we supposed to fight an entire army, a mecha giant, and that crazy weapon?","Go ahead, take your time, just bending a giant wall!","Man, have we got a lot of people hurt!","''Is that everybody?!","Gah!''","This is my hometown and I hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing!","Let her take the city for now!","We'll think of some way to come back and beat her!","You're about to get the world's largest hot foot, metal lady!","Hit it now!","''Opal!''","Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha suits but not the big one?","Be with you in one second!","Kind of busy!","Okay, ready now!","Kuvira must've done some override thing and taken control!","Ummm ...

is in the right place.","You'll just have to trust it.",".","He said he'd be here, but I can't worry about it.","I have to make sure you have everything you need for a safe trip.","The Everstorm?","Uh, where'd you get the ride?","Well, what do you know?","Looks like-- My brother doesn't like ghost stories.","I think we're here.","Bolin, just stay calm, there's no reason to- panic!","Is everyone okay?","Oh, great.","There goes our equipment.","Now what are we supposed to do?","Don't worry sir, I'll keep an eye on Korra for you.","Nothing, he was just worried about you, that's all.","There aren't any sides.","We all just want to help however we can.","You have to trust that we're here for you.","Wait a second, there's no way she's going alone.","Good luck.","I can't believe it.","You never cease to amaze me.","It's harder being the Avatar's boyfriend.","Uh, you all right, bro?","Uh, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her.","Yeah.","Guys do that all the time.","Just tell her you're not that into her anymore.","Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a blood-sucking leech.","You just gotta rip it off and get it over with.","You'll feel a lot better afterwards.","Trust me.","How was your day, sweetie?","Uh, do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen?","I'm still not clear on that.","How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff, and we go out for a quiet dinner.","Just the two of us.","I though you were breaking up with her.","What happened to \"ripping off the leech\"?","So it was more like you tugged at the leech.","Korra's parents were arrested?","Wait, how are your girl problems my fault?","The coast is clear.","You can come out.","I'm gonna go see how Korra's doing.","What happened?","Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief.","It was a setup.","If you do this, there's no going back.","Of course, I'll help.","I don't even want to know.","If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father.","Um, why do you have a plane on your boat?","What is that?","I'm all yours.","Maybe you should sit this out.","I just think having you there blatantly supporting one side will only make things worse.","You could at least try to seem neutral.","Whatever, I gotta go to work.","I don't know, Bolin.","Figure something out.","Hey!","Stop!","Republic City Police!","I saw a firebender running away from the blast.","The North might not be responsible for this.","I'm sure he cares, but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the South Pole that has nothing to do with them.","What's with you and sides?","Why do you always think I'm working against you?","I'm doing my ''job''.","Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't keep messing it up!","You're the one who's like this!","Uh-huh.","What?","That's a terrible idea!","Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here.","Something doesn't make sense about this bombing.","I just don't buy that the Northern Water Tribe was behind it.","Wait a second!","That's him!","That's the guy that attacked the center!","I gotta go show this to Beifong!","I got a break in the bombing case.","I I.D.","'d the guy I saw at the scene.","You think?","I'm sorry, I just-- um, I found something out about the bombing.","This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions.","He's a member of the Agni Kais.","Someone must have hired him to make it look like ''Northerners'' attacked the Cultural Center.","Did you learn anything about that remote control I found at the scene?","That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible.","Thank you, sir.","Yes, sir.","Yes, sir.","Wait, there's something you should know.","Korra, let me explain.","Look, the President of the Republic asked me a direct question.","What was I supposed to do?","Enough!","Look, I have a job to do!","I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another ''huge'' mistake!","Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our ''relationship''!","Yeah.","I guess I am.","I broke up with the Avatar.","I'm so sorry.","Your entire shipment was stolen.","Don't worry.","I'm gonna find whoever's responsible.","Chief Beifong is about to question the captain of the ship.","Like the bombs at the cultural center.","I gotta grab some evidence.","Chief, I think there's a link between this attack and the attack at the cultural center.","Solving this case.","Did any of the people who attacked you have one of these in their hand?","I think it's a remote detonator.","Chief, I don't think the people who attacked were Northern Water Tribe.","Was this one of the guys who attacked?","Chief, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys.","Lu and Gang are idiots.","I hate them and their stupid mustaches.","A sting operation.","I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it.","It's not that easy.","For the plan to work, we need the police, and Beifong already said no.","I don't know.","I don't want to go behind Beifong's back.","If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force.","I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job.","First of all, we'd need a ship.","All right, I'm in.","Let's get these guys.","Not yet.","We need some extra manpower.","Right, uh ... Korra.","Yeah, actually, she's um ... she's out of town right now.","Yeah, yeah.","Forget about Korra.","I'll go talk to Bolin.","Is this a marble statue of you?","We don't even have hats.","I don't have time to take a dipity dip, okay?","I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help.","You're sitting in a hot tub.","Are you gonna help or not?","So that's a no.","What am I supposed to do now?","No, but it's our last resort.","I'm not here on police business.","I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action.","I am personal friends with that Avatar.","I ''might'' be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back.","This is right around the area where the attacks happened.","So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet.","Two Toed Ping, please.","Ping, stay focused!","There's nothing to know.","I broke up with her.","I don't know.","All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?","Wait, guys.","Do you hear that?","Ah!","What's taking so long?","I'm gonna check it out.","I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper.","We've been double-crossed.","We have to get off this ship.","They're getting closer.","Watch out!","We're not gonna make it.","One down, one to go.","Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted.","Whoever paid the Triple Threats stole everything.","We should check out your other warehouses.","Maybe they didn't have time to hit them all.","We have to search the place for evidence.","If we can find a lead ...","I can figure this out.","Well, I'm not giving up on you.","Uh ...","It's-it's okay.","Um ...","Anyway ...","I gotta run.","I'm gonna find out who did this.","And I know just who to ask.","Who hired you to double-cross us?","I think you do know.","And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to \"No Toed Ping\".","You expect me to believe that?","Get out of here.","Bolin, have you seen Varrick around?","Bolin!","Nuktuk.","Where's Varrick?","I need to ask him something.","How did you rig those explosions to go off like that?","Varrick.","Asami, I think I know who set us up.","What are you doing here?","Yeah, and I'm ''real'' close to proving it.","I'll fill you in later.","Asami, there you are.","Is Bolin around?","Good.","I've got something to tell you both.","I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries: Varrick.","Yes!","It was a ploy.","He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it.","He already had all the shipping.","All he needed was Future Industries.","I ''am'' stressed!","Dating?","No!","Guys, listen to me.","Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof.","The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the cultural center attack.","And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when Asami's shipment was hijacked.","Don't you see?","Gah!","No!","I'm not going to let it go!","Go ahead.","Torture me all you want.","I'm not gonna talk.","Know what?","I have a job.","What are you saying?","Thanks for your ''concern'', but the answer is no.","Did you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?","I'm fine.","No, thanks.","I'm a little busy.","Maybe I do need to get my mind off things.","What's going on?","All right.","It's true.","We were trying to figure out who stole Asami's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation.","I'm sorry for going behind your back.","You're gonna believe a bunch of criminals?","I don't know where those came from.","None of that is mine.","That's not true, Asami.","I would never do anything to hurt you.","It's ''Varrick''.","This is all ''Varrick''.","He set me up!","I am not a criminal!","I was set up!","Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war.","That's why he had me arrested.","No!","I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems.","Where's Asami?","She'll listen to me.","Bolin, wait.","If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere.","Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.","So, how was the big premiere?","Wait, wh-what?","I knew it!","Don't worry about it bro.","Korra ... hey, I missed you, too.","So you're not still mad at me?","We had that fight before you left, remember?","Uh ... No.","No, it wasn't that bad.","We're not interested in your tea.","And this isn't a friendly visit.","It's okay.","We're going to stop Unalaq, and get Jinora back.","I'm sure he's fine.","What's up with the coat?","And where did you get that pie?","Will you keep it down?","I'm waiting for the right moment.","I hate it when you listen to me.","Fine!","Uh ... Um ...","Uh no, no, nothing.","Don't worry, there's no way they'll be expecting this.","We tried.","We don't need to win, we just need to stop Unalaq from getting back in the Spirit World.","Please, let us out.","Come on, your dad has become an evil monster.","He's gonna bring on eternal darkness.","Why would you protect someone who doesn't care about you at all?","Yes!","Wow!","That was the best acting I've ever seen.","You completely fooled her.","They're coming for Korra!","I don't even know what to say.","Hey, can we talk?","There's something I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had.","I know I said it wasn't that bad, but, that's not exactly true.","I, um ... I-I broke up with you.","But, I thought you said you lost part of your memory.","That's okay.","I think we've both said things that we regret.","I know I should have, but ...","I didn't wanna hurt you all over again.","I guess part of me wanted to forget about the break-up too.","You're right.","I'll always love you, Korra.","Ow!","Police.","He what?","Slow down.","Okay, I'm on my way.","What the heck did all this?","Okay, just tell me what happened.","Like what?","Sir, that's impossible.","There are only five airbenders in the entire world, and, your brother is not one of them.","Police.","Open up.","Get out here, sir, or I'm knocking this door down.","One, two-- I got a call last night.","About a guy who just started ''airbending'' out of nowhere.","He ... blew a door down on me and got away.","We got an all-points bulletin out on him right now.","Oh, well, y'know, you should leave it with the police.","It's ... police business.","Y'know.","It's um ... official.","No, I'm fine.","I should just, get going.","So, as you were ladies.","Of course, Korra.","Avatar.","Avatar Korra.","Once I received your message I proceeded to contact various locations within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by you, the Avatar.","There are reports of airbenders popping up all over the Earth Kingdom.","I marked the villages on this map.","You guys can take it with you.","Really?","Uh, it's probably better if I sit this one out.","I'm sorry, I can't.","Korra already asked, bro.","I can't just leave Republic City.","I have a life here, and a job.","It's not just that.","I feel like I've been drifting apart from everyone.","Okay, all right, I'll come with you.","I guess I gotta call Beifong.","She's not going to be happy.","As of now, these are the towns where we've gotten reports about airbenders.","It looks like we can hit up most of them before we get to Ba Sing Se.","Korra, enough!","Let's get out of here!","I am the escaped convict, and you will all reap my fire.","Ah!","Hey!","Let me go!","This is not what we rehearsed!","Korra!","Guys!","I think we got trouble.","Right here, I found him slipping away.","With your stash of gold?","Enough with the lies kid.","I want the truth.","I just want you to know that I'm going to be watching you, kid.","I know exactly what you're all about, 'cause I've been there.","You don't have me fooled.","I knew that kid was no good.","He was just waiting for an opportunity to run away again.","What's the point?","He obviously doesn't care about us.","Fine.","Bolin and I will find him.","Kai!","Get back here!","What are you doing running around robbing people?","Yeah right.","Let's go.","You're in big trouble.","Hey!","Your little brother, huh?","Reminds me of my little brother.","All right.","Let's see if we can catch a train back to the Upper Ring.","I bet everyone's freaking out that we've been gone all night.","I don't want any part of it.","Besides, look at this fruit, it's disgusting.","We don't want to steal this.","No, I just said I don't want any of this rotten fruit.","So you want me to steal it?","How do you know our names?","I'm sorry, they were killed when we were little.","So why did Dad leave Ba Sing Se?","We actually need to get back to the Avatar in the Upper Ring.","We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders in Ba Sing Se.","We have to get back to the Upper Ring and tell Korra.","Thanks.","I know this wasn't easy.","I wished we could stay.","But if it's true the Earth Queen is forcing airbenders into her army, we have to do something about it.","We will, Grandma.","The Earth Queen's been secretly taking away airbenders and ''forcing'' them into her army.","I bet they're under Lake Laogai.","What?","I've been reading some of Jinora's books.","The old Dai Li agents used to have a secret fortress beneath the lake.","Why were they trying to kidnap Korra?","Come on.","We're getting you out.","Then don't tell him.","Yes, we can!","I had a lot of money in that wallet!","A city called Zaofu, the home of the Metal Clan.","You've done your research.","Uh, that's because you escaped prison.","So, you and Opal seemed to hit it off dinner.","I think she's really into you.","Right, I forgot.","Your type is dumb mover star or psycho ice princess.","Hey, has anyone seen Chief Beifong?","I'll do it.","Uhh, Chief, you've been sleeping for sixteen hours.","We just wanted to make sure that you're okay.","Whoa.","Nice shot, Bolin!","But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending.","What's going on?","I can't hear anything.","I hate sitting down here!","Uh, not because of you.","Let her go!","They've got Korra!","We can't let them take her.","Bolin can land a shot.","Copy that.","It's Bolin time.","You have to!","No go!","I said no!","Wait!","Bolin, take the shot!","Haha, nice job, little bro!","I got something!","It looks like it's from them.","\"Team assembled.","Ready to rendezvous.\"","Let's go confront him with this evidence right now.","I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard ''right now''.","Every minute we waste here, those guys get further away.","I mean, how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals anyway?","That guard is only eighteen years old and has lived in Zaofu his entire life.","Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than thirteen years.","What were you saying about the evidence?","Oh, you mean exactly like what you did to me?","You're right.","All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fallback.","For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city: Aiwei.","We have to get in there and find some evidence that links Aiwei to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us.","Bolin, put that back!","We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything.","You forgot where it goes, didn't you?","These look like scuff marks.","I think this bookshelf slides open.","Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.","But don't you think it's weird how young he is?","How did he ever get mixed up with this group?","Come on, he's getting away!","He's gone.","And he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here.","He had an escape plan all ready to go.","Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought, and more dangerous.","Let's ask around.","Maybe someone's seen him.","No.","Those are wanted posters, and there's one for each of us.","\"Wanted by Her Majesty, the Earth Queen, for crimes against the Kingdom.\"","I'm guessing this is because we took her airbenders.","Bolin and I will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis, and see if he's hold up there.","No.","You and Asami wait here in case he comes back.","Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves.","Enough!","Let's just find Aiwei.","I'm a cop.","I don't have a backstory.","Let's see if this guy knows anything.","Excuse me, sir?","We're looking for a man about sixty, balding, wearing glasses in a long green robe.","That's him!","Any idea where he is now?","No luck here.","We've been made.","Let's lose 'em!","Okay, I think we're clear.","We should head back to Korra before someone else recognizes us.","All right.","Stay cool and follow my lead.","Keep an eye on him.","I'll go get Korra.","We found Aiwei hiding in an inn.","No.","Once Aiwei knows we're onto him, we lose our advantage.","I say we stake out his room and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him.","Good afternoon.","We'd like a room on the ground floor, across from 102, please.","We'll just take the one across from 102.","Trust me, it'll be perfect.","Kind of busy here, bro.","Assuming we do find Zaheer, what then?","He was locked away for thirteen years, Korra, and never broke.","I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy.","Yeah, we spy on them.","If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely.","Then we'll find out who they are and what they want.","No, I just saw him peeking out of his window fifteen minutes ago.","It's in my logbook.","Korra, wait!","You're going to blow our element of surprise.","We'll watch him in case he wakes up.","Be careful!","Uh, I don't know how, but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us.","I just said I don't know how!","Get Korra out of here.","Bolin and I will hold them off.","If you think holding us hostage will give you some leverage against the Avatar, you're gonna be very disappointed.","And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu?","You had her paralyzed.","Why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?","Bolin, would you stop making friends with the bad guys?","We have to find a way out of here before Zaheer gets his hands on Korra.","Listen.","Bolin, this is up to you.","I know you can metalbend.","Yes you can.","I believe in you.","You've always had the ability deep down.","You just haven't had the motivation.","But this is your time!","Get us out of here to save Korra.","You can do it!","Bolin!","Bolin!","We have to get out of here, Bolin.","Zaheer came here to take out the Earth Queen, and now Korra is next.","Shut up!","You have to metalbend us out of here.","C'mon!","I know you can do it!","This is your time!","I know I did it, but now it's ''really'' your time.","Do it!","I don't think that was you.","I can't believe it!","The Upper Ring is in chaos!","This isn't our battle.","We have to deliver Zaheer's message to Korra immediately.","We need an airship.","Excuse me, may I have your attention please?","I'm with the Republic City Police and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar.","What, they took everything.","I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?","You know how to fly this thing?","Up!","Up!","The whole city is falling to pieces.","Move over, we're getting them out.","Yeah.","No, Grandma.","I'm not sure where we're gonna take you, but right now, we need to find Korra.","I'm afraid so.","Her airship went down somewhere in the desert.","She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading to Ba Sing Se.","If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage.","That's a Ba Sing Se airship, all right.","But where's the rest of it?","Okay, all right, Naga.","It's good to see you, too.","Gah!","Stop!","You're licking my mouth.","You guys are okay!","Don't get all mushy on me, Chief.","Tonraq.","Sir.","Uhm, forgive my brother.","We're just really honored to meet you, Sir.","Uh, actually, that's Asami.","This is Avatar Korra.","Korra, this is my grandma, Yin.","We were captured by Zaheer and taken to Ba Sing Se.","We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown.","Zaheer let us go.","Zaheer is headed to the Northern Air Temple as we speak.","He said he's gonna wipe out the new Air Nation and everyone in it.","Unless you turn yourself over to him.","He's already taken out the Earth Queen.","I don't think he bluffs.","I agree.","Unfortunately, we don't have a radio on the airship.","We'll never make it up there before Zaheer.","Guys.","We got through to the air temple.","Bird calls, really?","What?","Will you sit down?","I'm already tense enough as it is.","I will, Chief.","Good luck.","Must have been some fight.","Not yet.","We're just arriving.","Don't turn yourself over until I get a visual on them.","They're here.","And so is the lavabender.","Korra, it was a trick!","They're not here.","Don't turn yourself over!","Chief, get Korra out of there.","Now!","Now what?","Bolin!","You're a lavabender.","It was all Bolin.","I thought we were done for, then out of nowhere, he ''lavabends''.","Well, why didn't you say something?","Must be more Red Lotus members than we thought.","Hey.","Um, I appreciate you coming back for us.","Sorry for ever giving you a hard time.","Yeah, you kind of did.","That's got to be where they took Korra.","We're going with you.","You help Korra, we got this.","You have no water.","It's over.","Prince Wu!","President Raiko has some really important ... king stuff to talk to you about.","He's a ''real'' charmer, huh?","Well, I just remind myself that once he's on the throne, I go back to being a detective.","I also go home, and smash my head into the wall for an hour, you know, just to get the stress out.","I haven't talked to him for a while, but he's coming in a few days for the coronation.","And Beifong told me that Korra is getting in tonight.","I don't know why we're leaving so early if you're just getting a haircut.","The dinner at Air Temple Island isn't until later tonight.","Are you kidding me?","What are you having done that takes four hours?","Yeah, I'm ... not interested.","That's ''disgusting''!","I don't know if all those people are your fans.","Wu, we have to get you out of here!","Go!","Go!","I think those were Kuvira's supporters in the crowd.","That's not blood.","It's strawberry pie.","You would have been hit by a pie.","It's really not that big of a deal.","You're allergic to bee stings!","Ugh.","This coronation cannot come soon enough.","I can't wait to go back to being a detective.","What?","No!","nan Get better soon!","Shouldn't you be getting ready to, I don't know ... rule a whole nation?","Yay ... You sure that's the guy you want running the Earth Kingdom?","And you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?","Bolin!","Look at you!","My little brother got all ... ''important''.","So, what's it like working for Kuvira?","From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.","Well, I've been working for Wu.","And, uhhh ... Yeah.","No.","She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he said she left the South Pole months ago.","No one knows where she is.","Don't worry about me.","I'll ... find a way to make it.","He's my brother.","You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira now that she's going against the wishes of the entire world, are you?","I don't know, bro.","By \"crushing\" anyone who gets in your way?","It seems like she's just a dictator who's taking the Earth Kingdom by force.","Well, no, but still ...","I'm sorry, I don't want to work for your glorious emperor and her military dictatorship.","I can't believe him!","Yeah.","Okay.","We need to get you out of here.","Okay, you're losing it.","Why?","Do you really ''want'' to be the king?","I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator, but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth Kingdom somewhat better.","If you were an Earth Kingdom citizen, do you think you're the kind of person you want as ''your'' king?","What have you ever done for your people?","I'm sorry, that was out of line.","Let's get you out of here and back to someplace safe.","No.","Korra!","Sorry, but I couldn't ditch him.","But he promised to be on his best behavior.","Wait, when did she tell you she couldn't?","What's going on with you two?","Well, why didn't you ever write to me?","Or Bolin?","\"Hello\" would have been nice.","Why would she ... Never mind.","I'm not gonna hold your hand every time you have to empty your \"royal bladder\".","Go to the bathroom on your own for once.","I don't go ''with'' him, with him, I just stand there in the general vicinity while he ...","I don't wanna talk about it.","I wonder what's taking Wu so long.","He's not one to miss out on lunch.","I'll go check on him.","Wu, are you in here?","Come on, your octopus fritters are getting cold.","Hang a right at the next block.","We can cut them off on Seventh.","You missed the turn!","Where are you going?!","What are you doing?","Sit down!","Where's the prince?","Take this guy in for booking.","Charge him with kidnapping and tell Chief Beifong that Prince Wu is missing.","Put out an all-points bulletin.","We'll keep looking.","Or they might try smuggling him out on an airship.","He could be anywhere!","The ''one'' time I don't watch him pee and ''this'' is what happens.","So, how do you know where Wu is just by touching some spirit vines?","Is that even possible?","Which train is Wu on?","Split up and start looking.","How do you know for sure he's here?","And I'm just supposed to trust your \"Avatar Feelings\"?","Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared.","Wu!","Wu, it's me.","No, you're on a train.","We're gonna get you out of here.","You all right?","You should be thanking Korra.","We never would have found you with out her.","Actually, that is like old times for me and Korra.","Yeah, but it's great to have you back.","I think I know just the place.","I don't.","This is Asami's place.","She was nice enough to let my family stay here after they fled Ba Sing Se.","Grandma, this is Prince Wu.","He needs to stay with you and the family for a little while.","She loves royalty.","Yeah, I agree.","Let's toughen you up.","Look at you!","You're so weak, \"Wu down\" is your catchphrase.","You don't know anything about me, do you?","Uhh ... you never asked?","Not since Korra and I broke up.","Bolin and I were playing for the Fire Ferrets.","Yes.","Will you just let me tell the story?","Come on, Bolin, we're up.","You know what else is rude?","''Interrupting''.","Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender and a loyal friend.","She helped me save Bolin when he was taken by the Equalists.","After going through such a crazy experience, I felt like Korra and I had a powerful connection.","Not exactly.","Ahhhh!","Hey.","When you got charm like mine, you don't need introductions.","Hanging out with Asami was awesome.","But it made things with Korra complicated.","We need to talk.","No, I haven't.","What I'm trying to say is, as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing.","Tu!","Get out of here!","Guys, Grandma, everything wasn't so cut and dry.","I wasn't ''dating'' Asami.","But my feelings for Korra became clear when Tarrlok captured her.","It felt like a piece of me was gone.","I was so worried.","Are you all right?","Things are crazy right now.","Can we deal with our relationship problems later?","''Asami''!","Yep.","Turns out, she was right.","It was time to man up and call it quits.","Asami.","I'm sorry things got so messed up between us.","But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.","Trust me, I wasn't.","Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together and after that, I was finally able to tell her how I felt.","Exactly how I felt.","I love you, Korra.","Ummmm ... Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.","I'm not taking his side.","There aren't any sides!","What's with you and sides?","Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!","Yeah ...","I guess I am.","After that, I dove into my work.","Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe.","Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps.","The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra.","It was an intense night.","Asami and I discovered the triads had double-crossed us.","We barely got away, but by then, Asami's warehouse had been cleared out.","Well ...","I'm not giving up on ''you''.","I know, I know, don't tell me ...","I had no right kissing Asami.","If only it had been that simple.","Korra ... hey, I-I missed you, too.","So you're not still mad at me?","We had that fight before you left, remember?","Ahhhhh ... Hmmmm, no.","No.","It-it wasn't that bad.","Well, me and Asami were never ''officially'' back together.","Well, eventually, I did tell Korra.","But by then, she already knew.","I know I should have, but ...","I didn't want to hurt you all over again.","I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup, too.","You're right.","After Harmonic Convergence, the world changed.","Team Avatar traveled around, searching for new airbenders.","At first, it was awkward being around Korra and Asami.","As you were.","Ladies.","But then I realized I had to figure out who I was without a lady in my life.","You did?","Good.","Korra!","Bolin, I'm so glad you're back.","I was worried about you.","Hello, anyone?","Wait.","Do you hear that?","Korra, look.","What are those?","Let's get them out.","Korra!","What's wrong?","What are you talking about?","I'm here for you.","What do you need?","Are you sure you're ready for this?","So ... how are you doing?","Do you think you're finally able to forget about what Zaheer did to you?","Nice job in there.","I'm proud of you.","You're starting to act like the kind of king I'd like to work for.","You always have to ruin it.","The problem is, it's a voluntary evacuation and there aren't very many volunteers.","They just don't feel like they're in any immediate danger.","We're on it.","Attention citizens of Republic City.","This is not a test.","An attack on our city is imminent.","President Raiko has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all citizens.","Please find your evacuation handbooks and turn to subsection one-dash-two-six.","There you will find initial instructions for your area.","For example, if you live in northwest vector one, report to your primary meeting location, which would be at the eastern entrance of the Southern Water Tribe library.","There, you would choose a leader as specified in section one-dash-two-eight.","What's confusing?","I'm giving very specific instructions.","We ''can't'' let it get to our doorstep.","This doesn't make sense.","There aren't any train tracks this way.","How are they transporting that super weapon of theirs?","Did you know Kuvira was building that thing?","Guys!","She must have our location!","She's pointing that weapon right at us!","What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet?","If Kuvira finds out that Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out.","I'm going for that lever.","You get the other one.","I'm ready!","One ... two ... three!","Nothing's happening!","There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here.","Come on.","You spent all that time working with Varrick and Baatar Jr.","Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?","I'm gonna zap these vines with some electricity.","Exactly.","This is our only way of shutting this thing down.","I can handle it.","I don't have time to argue!","I'm doing this, so get out of here!","Promise.","I love you, too.","Now go!","Korra!","Tenzin, there's no sign of her.","My cousin told me how level-headed you were during the whole evacuation.","I got to admit, I'm impressed.","I think you're going to make a great leader.","But that doesn't mean I'm gonna set you up with Korra, so don't ask.","Are ... you joking?","That's ... actually pretty wise and mature of you.","Much better.","You don't need to say anything.","I want you to know, I'll follow you into battle, no matter how crazy things get.","I've got your back ... and I always will ."]},"Fangirl":{"combined_dialog":["Aaaaaah!","I love you,

Korra.","Long time, no see.","Now that your little pro-bending distractions are over, I look forward to your return to my task force.","That is unfortunate to hear, but I'm sure you'll come to your senses as you have in the past.","Avatar Korra, what do you think you are doing?","What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.","This is your last warning.","Stay out of my ''way''!","Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom, but the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down.","The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists or even be associated with them.","It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall.","That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands.","We must pass this law.","All in favor?","Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here.","This is an Equalist rally.","There is nothing innocent about it.","They are the ''enemy''!","Round up all these Equalists!","You're under arrest!","Actually, I can.","She's a nonbender out past curfew and her father is a known Equalist

mind?","Spit it out.","And you don't?","Isn't that what you came here to do?","Intimidate me into releasing your friends.","See, that's what I admire about you, Korra.","Your willingness to go to

you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar!","My life is a disaster now, thanks to you.","I ''was'' his son, but in order to win Republic City, I had to become someone else.","My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly.","My plan was perfect.","I was to be the city's savior.","But you, you ruined everything!","Oh no.","No, I'll escape and start a new life.","And you're coming as my hostage.","Amon!","You fool!","You've never faced bending like mine.","What?","What are you?","I don't suppose you're here to rescue me.","No, I'm the only one.","I'm Amon's brother.","Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe.","He's a waterbender and a bloodbender, just like I was.","No, not until after he captured me.","It all began with my father, Yakone.","With the help of his former gang, he escaped prison and underwent surgery to change his appearance.","He assumed a new identity, and settled down in the Northern Water Tribe.","That's where he met my mother, a warm, caring woman.","Before long, they started a family together.","Amon was the firstborn, under the name Noatak.","I was born three years later.","Noatak was a good-natured kid, always looking out for me.","Those were the good years.","Before my brother and I discovered we were waterbenders.","At first we were excited by our new abilities, but our training brought out a different side of my father.","I'm trying, but- Even back then, my brother wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally.","When I was seven, my father took me and Noatak on a hunting trip far away from our home.","He told us his true identity was Yakone, Republic City's most notorious crime boss, and that he was once a bloodbender of rare skill.","What's bloodbending?","The good days were behind us.","Every full moon, our father took us on another supposed \"hunting trip,\" where he secretly trained us in bloodbending.","We kept the truth from my mother.","Stop!","You're hurting it!","A few years later, my father taught us to bloodbend anytime, without the need of the full moon.","We practiced constantly, and I hated every minute of it.","I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals.","My brother, however, seemed to revel in this newfound power.","He was a prodigy, mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen.","No.","I won't do it.","That felt awful.","I don't want to do that to anyone.","I never want to bloodbend again.","Run away?","But what about Mom?","We can't just leave her.","Noatak!","Don't leave!","Please!","Noatak!","My father and I searched for days, but we never found a sign of Noatak.","We thought he perished in that storm.","My mother was never the same after the loss of my brother.","My father stopped training me.","With Noatak gone, his hopes for revenge withered.","And he passed away, a few years later.","Avatar Korra.","I am truly sorry for all that I did to you.","I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me.","I became a soldier of revenge, just like he wanted me to be.","And so did my brother.","The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes bending is the source of all evil in the world.","When he took my bending, the sensation was somehow familiar.","I later recognized it as my brother's bloodbending grip.","I don't know ''how'' he does it, but then again, I've never encountered a bender as strong as Noatak.","Go.","Amon can't know anyone spoke with me.","Defeat him.","Put an end to this sad story.","Noatak.","Yes, Noatak.","It will be just like the good old days."]},"Fire Nation councilwoman":{"combined_dialog":["Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal, but who would even head up such a task force?"]},"Asami":{"combined_dialog":["Oh, no!","I'm

to be honest with her.","Tell her how you really feel.","Where are you?","Your assistant's in there too?","Yeah, you think?","Me too.","So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?","Sorry.","But there's no runway.","How are we supposed to take off?","I better go check on my factory.","Huh?","Hey!","In a hurry?","Yeah, me too.","And my company is about to go under.","I have to find a way to make some sales.","It's dangerous on the seas right now, but I'm willing to try if you are.","Is it true?","Without that sale, I don't know how much longer I can keep my company going.","What am I gonna do?","Wait, where are you going?","Without the money from that shipment, Future Industries is almost broke.","Wait, I think Mako might be onto something.","He's doing a better job than you!","Forget them.","What's this idea of yours?","Let's do it.","We can make it work, just the two of us.","Mako, I need your help.","My Mom is gone.","My Dad is in jail.","Future Industries

Threats?","Varrick invited me to watch some of the filming.","Are you filming right now?","He attacked his own ship?","Varrick helped ''save'' Future Industries.","He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind.","Mako, you seemed stressed.","You guys aren't living together anymore?","Sounds like you've had a pretty busy week.","Maybe you just need to relax.","That's crazy!","Anyone could have gotten their hands on one of those detonators.","Hi.","No.","I just wanted to come by to make sure you're okay.","You seemed so agitated earlier.","Maybe you need a night off.","Why don't we go

stole everything from me and you tried to kidnap the president.","Those are pretty bad, too.","Almost, but ...","I just picked up a distress signal from the southern troops.","There's a problem.","Hold on, maybe Bumi's right.","We don't have a catapult and hog monkeys, but we have a flying bison and there's a plane on Varrick's ship.","Maybe we can attack from above.","Mako, Bolin and I can use the plane to create a distraction, and scatter some of the defenses.","You, Tenzin, Bumi and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening.","Are you ready?!","Get ready!","Fire!","Brace yourselves!","Mhmm.","Yip-yip.","What about Korra and the others?","Don't worry, we'll figure something out.","You can't take that to heart.","People are just frustrated.","Where's Mako?","You're the Avatar, master of all the elements.","You should know how to drive.","Besides, it's relaxing.","Clutch!","Clutch!","That's the brake.","Let's try again.","You ready?","Well, Mako has never been the most ... \"in touch with his feelings\" guy, but it'll get better eventually.","Yeah ... we all knew.","Sorry.","Actually, I need to tell you something about that, and I should have told you this sooner, but ... while you were gone ...","I ... kind of ... kissed him.","I'm sorry.","You're not mad?","You what?","I'm just kidding.","I knew a long time ago.","Vine!","Vine!","Korra, you okay?","Did someone order a fully equipped Future Industries airship?","I figured if we're going to Ba Sing Se to search for airbenders, we should do it in style.","Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder to convince him to join us.","I don't think I've seen him since we landed.","Are you sure we shouldn't have brought more people to collect the tax money?","So much for our escorts.","Hey, I think I can use a break.","You letting off steam is starting to, hurt.","A lot.","Mako.","Bolin.","You're okay.","Where have you been?","Can you interpret that?","It's the Queen.","Because our airship is having engine trouble.","It'll take me until tomorrow to finish the repairs.","Oh great, not the Queen again.","We just got a call from the radio about another airbender.","Aren't you coming?","What are you doing here?","You mean ''my'' company.","Future Industries reverted back to me after ''you'' plotted to abduct the President.","Guys, it's time to get cleaned up.","Tonight is Opal's farewell dinner.","Uh ...","I think it's broken.","I don't think they're going to get far.","Look!","There's no way to cross that moat.","And look at this.","What do you mean?","It's just an empty book.","Aiwei's coming back!","Quick.","We don't know.","And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer.","Uhh, guys ... We should get out of here.","This must be Aiwei's jeep.","He can't be far.","Are you okay?","I don't know.","But I think I found a clue.","All right.","Xai Bau's Grove, where are you?","Go away!","I'm trying to find something.","We found something too.","It looks like he's gonna meet Zaheer at sundown at a place called Xai Bau's Grove.","But I can't find it anywhere on the map.","I'll play.","So?","I learned to play from my dad, the diabolical genius.","I'll destroy you.","Why?","This game is all about slow, methodical strategy.","I don't know what Shady Shin taught you, but it wasn't the real Pai Sho.","Let me see that.","There have been countless variations of Pai Sho through the centuries and each culture has its own rules and variations of the game.","Then I guess I know you pretty well.","I win.","I can't believe it.","You might actually win this one.","Maybe he sneaked out when you weren't looking.","How?","What do we do?","What's the Red Lotus?","And Zaheer didn't capture us, the Earth Queen's forces did.","I'm not sure.","Some camp by the desert.","They're taking us back to Ba Sing Se.","Do I have to be chained to the floor the whole way?","It's going to be so uncomfortable.","Can't you just chain me to that railing?","I mean, where am I gonna go?","Please?","Thank you, Sir.","Don't worry, I have a plan.","These airships the Cabbage Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are ''way'' cheaper than the ones Future Industries built.","Now that's just shoddy workmanship.","There's no way I can get these locks off.","I need the keys.","Give me five minutes, then start yelling for help.","I think you might have been a little over-aggressive with the airbending.","The controls are busted.","Also, you broke the radio.","Hang on to something!","Well.","They say any landing you could walk away from is a good landing.","But, given our location, I'm not so sure about that.","It doesn't look good.","Even if you metalbend the propellers back into shape, we have to dig this whole thing out of the sand.","If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running.","Wait, did that sand dune just move?","That's no mirage.","Look.","How's it looking in there?","Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert.","Kong, you want to see if you can get the engine started?","We might not have a few hours.","Maybe we can still build something to get us all out of here.","No, but we might have enough material to construct a makeshift sand-sailer.","Like the sandbenders use to get around.","All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to.","She ain't pretty, but I think she'll do the job.","You want to buy a slightly used sand-sailer?","Did you find Mako and Bolin?","Uh, so what happened to you two?","Where have you been?","I'll watch over her as she meditates.","Did you find Zaheer?","You can't expect us to sit by and let Zaheer take you.","Be careful, Korra.","It's okay, Tenzin.","We're about to get you out of here.","Where're the airbenders?","Come on.","We have to get to the airship.","Where's Oogi?","How?","There you go.","All fixed up for a formal Avatar appearance.","Take a look.","We should go inside.","I do like the idea of putting you on a train and sending you far, ''far'' away.","Yeah ...","I'm aware of who you are.","Superhuman?","He's ... something.","How can you stand being his bodyguard?","And that works?","It's good to see you, Mako.","It's been too long.","You hear from Bolin lately?","I can't wait to see her.","It's going to be weird, having the old Team Avatar back in the city after all these years.","Are you sure you don't want some company in the Southern Water Tribe?","I'm happy to come with you.","Bye, Korra!","Dear Korra.","I miss you.","It's not the same in Republic City without you.","How are you feeling?","Things are going well here.","I just got a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, so I'll be keeping pretty busy for a while.","I came to return these.","Stop writing me.","I never want to see or hear from you again.","When I first came here, it was because I wanted to tell you ''face to face'' that I never wanted to see or hear from you again.","I wanted my words to hurt you so that you would know how you hurt me.","But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt.","It was sadness.","You tainted our past and destroyed our future together.","I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you.","But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.","I thought we could play some Pai Sho.","Like we used to.","Only three years.","It's so good to see you again.","And I'm loving the hair.","Come on.","Mako got us a table at the restaurant.","So can you go into the Avatar State again?","I was worried when you told me you couldn't.","Well, I kind of have some big news.","I went to visit my father for the first time.","He had been writing me letters and I guess I finally felt ready to try and forgive him.","You think I don't know what my ''own father'' is capable of?","You don't get to disappear for three years and then act like you know what's best for me!","Get in!","I know these streets better than you.","I built some of them!","They must have moved Wu to a different vehicle when we lost sight of them.","Where do we start?","There are ''thousands'' of cars in the city and he could be in any one of them.","Or maybe a boat.","Are you sure?","How do you know?","Who taught you that?","You met ''Toph''?","What was she like?","If we don't find Wu soon, we might never find him.","Guys, shh.","Listen.","But it was kind of like old times.","Except for the getting on each other's nerves part.","It's all right.","I guess after being apart for three years, there's bound to be a bit of an adjustment period.","I've noticed how you treat Korra, how you acted when she was missing.","You have feelings for her, don't you?","Well, there might not be a relationship to worry about later.","I care about you, too.","My company ... it's over ...","I give up.","I brought you some tea.","I thought you might be cold out here.","Are you okay?","You seem out of sorts.","That's ridiculous.","No, she ''doesn't''.","The world ''does'' need you.","You're the Avatar.","Korra, you're forgetting about all the good that happened after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was.","The Equalist Movement lost its leader ''and'' its power.","Free elections were held in the United Republic and nonbenders ''finally'' had a voice.","People had hope again and it was all because of you.","But you became more powerful, too.","I mean ... you turned into a giant spirit.","And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing.","You brought back the airbenders ''and ''caused a positive shift in the world.","She is?","Right.","Everything you do is \"allegedly\".","Like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center!","Fine.","I'll help.","But don't even think about double-crossing me again.","If it works, it'll even the playing field.","Apparently on a giant mecha suit!","Let's go to my factory.","Maybe we can get a few of those hummingbird suits up and running.","We can't fight it, but maybe we can cripple it.","Zhu Li, when you were spying on Kuvira, did you learn anything about that metal monster?","What should we do?","Not all of them.","There are the prototypes back at my office.","If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support.","I can't stabilize it!","I thought you fixed the hydraulics.","Dad?","But the saws are way too big.","We'd never get the suits off the ground.","Like a metal mosquito.","Just a few more minutes.","If we stop that mecha giant, it will all be because of you.","I love you, Dad.","We need to get out of here.","We have to go now!","Dad!","Now!","Dad!","And so has Korra!","Excuse me Tenzin, Varrick is looking for you.","Something about wanting to borrow a glidersuit to fly off the tower?","For what?","Thank you.","I'm just glad I was able to forgive him.","I'm kind of all danced out.","Honestly, after

Looks like we've got a music lover here.","Reinforcements!","All right, soldiers, looks like it's on us to save the day, luckily I've got a plan.","All right, spirit army.","Your general is here.","Follow me!","It's working!","It's not working!","Get me out of here!","All right guys, rescue time.","I did it all with my trusty flute and ... ah, never mind, you wouldn't believe it anyway.","Let's get moving.","Jinora.","Jinora's spirit do you hear me?","It's your Uncle Bumi.","We just need to employ the simply rules of tracking.","First we locate her footprints ... then we follow them.","We're in the Spirit World.","There's spiritual energy in every direction.","Well, that didn't work.","Now where are we?","That's not the same mushroom.","Oh sure, listen to a fungus over your own brother.","Mushroom?","Is that you?","Iroh?!","Are you this is the best way to find Jinora?","What kind of prison doesn't have any bars or walls?","We can walk right out of here.","Wait a second.","Yes.","They're all around us.","The cannibals, they're everywhere.","Yes, there are!","They're gonna eat every last one of us!","They're closing in!","I gotta get out of here!","Huh?","What happened?","What happened?","Uhhh ... what did you say to her exactly?","Bum-Ju, you're okay.","I missed you, little buddy.","Come back, Bum-Ju!","If you don't want to wear the sweater I made you, that's fine.","I'm sorry I got mad!","Bum-Ju, I'm running out of tree.","Can we go down now?","Ahhh!","Bum-Ju, a little help!.","Look, I'm airbending!","Ah!","Ow, that still hurt a lot.","You're not gonna believe what just happened.","Where's your father?","The most amazing, wondrous, fantastical thing just occurred.","Okay, Bum-Ju and I had a little fight.","I made him this sweater, and he didn't seem to like it, and I'll admit, it might need work, but it was my first attempt at knitting, so I was a little hurt.","No, check this out.","I can airbend.","Yeah wait, seriously, I was doing it.","No hold on, I just uh, maybe if I- No.","I swear, I'm not making it up.","It's not a joke.","Oh, did you see that?","I think the napkin moved.","Wait!","Maybe I can only do it when my life is in danger.","Bolin, bend a giant boulder at me.","I told you!","Wait 'till I tell Mom, she's gonna love this.","Ugh, I can't figure this thing out.","And you didn't tell me?","That's how they got me to join the United Forces.","It's okay Tenzin, I still want to be an airbender.","Well, maybe you gotta do more to get them excited.","You need to add a little razzle-dazzle.","I was gonna say we could cover Tenzin's robe in sequins, but that's even better!","Don't worry about me, little lady.","I've been in a scrap or two you know.","Ha ha.","Oh, you're just a youngster, so I'm gonna go easy on ya.","Wouldn't want to hurt a kid ... Oh.","Hmm, did I drop my wallet?","Give me that, you little thief!","He's not over here.","Well, technically, the Earth Queen has a right to conscript her citizens.","What?","It's true.","You mean that out-of-body thing you did to help giant, spirity Korra?","All right.","We go in under the cover of darkness: two small insertion teams and a third on the outside.","Then all we'll need is twelve tons of blasting jelly, a medium-sized bulldozer and ... does anyone have a badgermole that knows Morse code?","No!","We've got the airbenders and we're headed out!","No one likes code names anymore.","Come on!","Everyone's in.","Let's go!","Greetings, air people.","I come seeking boring stories to take back to the Spirit World.","And so, we bring the net down on the head pirate, and he looks around real sad and says, \"I knew I should have followed my dreams and become a dentist.\"","Well, I guess cool is something you're born with.","Let me guess, you want to criticize me for something?","Oh yeah.","With what?","True, I did win the Admiral Tung Natural Leadership Award, twice.","I'd love to.","You've got to use military discipline to whip these troops into shape.","The only way to deal with new recruits is to break them down so you can build them back up.","Rule with an iron fist.","Show them who the master is.","My pleasure.","What are you doing?","It's barely light out.","If it weren't so cold, I'd go right back to sleep.","You know when I said that thing about an iron fist- Can we go back to bed now?","I'm finished!","I've never wanted to be an airbender and I'm too old to be back in boot camp.","Count me out!","I'm not talking to you.","No, I don't think I should apologize.","Tenzin just wants to boss everybody around.","I'm too old for that.","Well, let's face it.","I'm just not cut out to be an airbender!","Well, that's your opinion.","Wait, Jinora sent this spirit?","Is she in trouble?","Jinora's in trouble.","We have to go get her.","Bum-Ju's friend told me.","More or less, I get the gist.","Let's go.","Master Tenzin isn't here.","It's up to us.","Ikki and Meelo, grab some bison.","Airbenders, move out!","Bison rustlers.","They've got Kai and Jinora locked in crates.","Looks like they're getting ready to leave, we'll have to move fast.","Listen, this is what we've been training for.","That's not important now.","Remembered how we persevered together on that obstacle course?","Well, I'm not quitting now.","I know we've had a tough time, me more than anyone, but we're airbenders, and there aren't many of us so we've got to stick together.","They've got two of our own in cages out there, and we're not leaving until we bring them home.","Maybe you boys haven't heard, but there's some new airbenders on these parts.","And you never mess with an airbender's bison.","I'm sorry I've been causing you so much trouble.","I guess I was just scared of not being able to measure up as an airbender.","You know, even though I'm Aang's son, I never really felt that I was a part of the Air Nation before.","What's going on, Tenzin?","It's Zaheer!","We have to leave.","I see you're having as much fun as I am.","I got you.","But we could die!","What are you talking about?","I feel great!","How can he fly like that?","Aren't you a sight for sore eyes!","Bum-Ju and I sure missed you.","Way to ruin the moment.","Where's

spirits.","Even during the most hallowed times.","This festival used to be a solemn time of fasting and meditation.","Now it's just a chance to watch some rube try to stick an entire arctic hen in his mouth.","Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in southern waters.","Some traditions have purpose.","I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that.","Apparently you haven't been given all of the information you need.","It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.","So you've said.","This is nothing.","When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits.","People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky.","And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits.","That is why I want so badly to teach you.","To help you fulfill your destiny.","Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn.","It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.","As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits.","But I am saddened to see what it has become: a cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.","I feel the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay.","Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters.","I only hope we are not too late to change course.","Go in peace.","As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways.","All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know.","The air temples will teach her nothing.","Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.","I know this was a hard decision, Korra, but it was the right one.","Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training.","I have great plans for you.","You're early.","I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits, I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training.","We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe, the South Pole.","We will do more than just train.","By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves, and now it threatens to destroy our tribe.","We must set things right.","The Southern Water Tribe depends on you.","Tonraq, what do you want?","Absolutely not.","You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done.","Because he's misguided.","The sad truth is, it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance.","He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since.","You will open an ancient spirit portal.","At the South Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the Spirit World, but it has long been closed.","There are no evil spirits, there is light and dark in them all.","But when they're unbalanced, the darkness takes over.","If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restored.","There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ends on the winter solstice.","That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together.","Only then can the Avatar open the portal.","Exactly, and we can't afford to wait another year.","You're right.","You should have told her a long time ago.","Yes.","There used to be lights at the South as well, but during the Hundred Year War, the South was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared.","When the War ended, the North helped to rebuild you ''physically'', as a nation, but we have not rebuilt you spiritually.","Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies.","Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm.","We ''must'' keep moving.","No!","The solstice is tonight.","And we're so close.","Let's open this portal and lead your father and the entire Southern Water Tribe in the right direction.","We don't have much time.","We've arrived.","It's just like the sacred forest Tonraq destroyed in the North.","You must find your way to the heart of the forest where the dormant spirit portal lies.","From here, you're on your own.","The Avatar must go alone.","You have to believe in yourself, like I believe in you.","What is it?","Korra, all the past Avatars live on inside of you.","Let them guide you.","Let them help you find the light in the dark.","Avatar Korra, you have taken the first step in bringing balance back to the South, and soon the whole world.","Opening the spirit portal was only the first step in getting the Southern Water Tribe back on its righteous path.","There's more difficult work to be done before our two tribes are ''truly'' united.","Now that you've opened the Southern portal, we need to protect it from the people who would do the spirits harm.","I need you for something more important.","There is another portal, in the North.","Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds.","The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North.","And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well.","The ''world'' will be united again.","Our next training sessions isn't until tomorrow.","Yes?","Your father has been talking to you.","I am their chief.","I'm uniting, not invading.","If the Water Tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides.","The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man.","That would be catastrophic.","We?","No, Korra.","This is a war only the Avatar can prevent.","As the Avatar, you must remain neutral in this conflict.","You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes finds unity.","Tenzin lacked faith in you.","But I have no doubt that you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.","Thank you for saving my life.","Find Varrick.","I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors.","You want them to go free?","Very well.","I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter.","Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial.","For conspiring to assassinate me.","I wish it hadn't come to this.","But your parents held meeting with the rebels, right here in their home.","Rest assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial.","He is the most fair and honorable man I know.","I'm sure you're right.","So we should have nothing to worry about.","I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked.","They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after Avatar Korra had saved me.","Korra, calm down.","I'll talk to him.","I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider.","Show these men and my brother mercy.","I'm sorry, Korra.","You'll never see your father again.","On a ship headed to the Northern Tribe.","He'll serve out his sentence there.","Remember who you are.","As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war.","You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity.","All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny.","If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South.","And even I will be powerless to stop them.","And why would I do that?","No, I don't.","You've served your purpose.","Leave them.","My brother's no threat to us up there.","Increase security around the spirit portal.","Keeping it safe is our number one priority.","I need you two to go after the Avatar.","She's the only one who can open the Northern spirit portal.","I told Korra what I thought she needed to hear.","I need her ''alive''.","Never mind that.","Where is the Avatar?","You didn't get her?","You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the Avatar.","You're right.","It was my fault for trusting you.","Harmonic Convergence is almost upon us.","This is my opportunity to change the world.","Good, because I'll need your help to open the northern portal.","I believe there is another way.","This way.","There it is, the northern portal.","By entering the Spirit World through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: our bending.","Join me!","Together, we can open this portal.","Leave him!","Keep bending!","This is more important!","The Avatar is dead, and we cannot open the Northern portal.","I have failed you, Vaatu.","How do you know?","I'll find her.","Leaving so soon?","When Wan Shi Tong told me he had a visitor, I had to see it with my own eyes.","I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself - what kind of a father is he?","Don't believe everything you read.","Why don't you come with me, so you can do some firsthand research?","If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal ''now''.","What will it be?","Open the portal- or lose your friend's soul

them.","We'll ship 'em South.","It's true.","If you can't make money during a war, you just flat-out ''cannot'' make money.","Don't worry, I'm already working on that.","As soon as people see ''this'', they'll be lining up to fight Unalaq.","Zhu Li, do the, uh-- the thing.","I had a film crew documenting the entire Northern invasion.","We're gonna cut this footage together with scenes we shoot of our superstar Bolin here playing a Southern Water Tribe hero ''battling'' the evil Unalaq.","''No one'' will root for the North after they see \"The Adventures of Nuktuk: ''Hero'' of the ''South''\"!","Ah, Nuktuk is ''never'' cold.","How about that, huh?","It's the latest product in my Varri-manageable Hair Line: Varri-dye!","We get some shots of her using it before Unalaq kidnaps her, I ''guarantee'' we sell a million cases week one.","What happened with General Iroh?","Bolin, look up there.","What do you see?","I'll tell you what I see: a ''star'' being born.","You're a star.","People love stars.","Stars tell them what to think and how to act.","Bolin, have you ever tried to force a monkey marmot to ride a bicycle?","Of course you haven't.","You can't ''force'' monkey marmots to do anything.","They've got to want to do it themselves!","With these movers, we'll have the support of the people, and before long, they'll persuade the President to lend his troops to the war effort.","Darn it, Zhu Li, haven't I told you I ''hate'' getting bad news without first getting ''good'' news?","That's ''old'' news!","Let's go.","Asami, I heard the news.","I can't

dynamic mustachioed duo!","Whooooo's hungry?","You need a ship?","I got a ship.","I want in on whatever you're talking about.","I love being in on plans.","Perfect!","I love not knowing

genius!","Everybody take five.","Except for you, Zhu Li.","Grab the tweezers.","I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve.","Hello, Mako.","Yep, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy.","Especially if that little guy can help ''this'' guy become a ''bigger'' guy.","I hear you've got some ideas.","You wanna tell me about them?","That the world is a dangerous place, and that's exactly why I want to offer you a job on my security force.","We need you.","Me, Asami, Bolin.","We're all in the same team here.","We want you to join us.","You wouldn't want anything to

the world.","Heck!","I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation!","They make the ''best'' red stuff over there.","Fact!","All right, picture time.","I wanted to.","Mister President, I took one look at your wife and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste.","And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!","Oh, I think you'll be surprised how persuasive I can be.","Thank you all for coming for the finale of \"Nuktuk: Hero of the South\"!","You know, when I first started this project there were a lot of naysayers out there.","\"You can't make pictures move\" they said.","\"You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a star\" they said.","\"You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak\" they said.","Well, they're ''wrong''!","Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices, and you'll be ''shocked'' to hear what they have to say.","They speak of the injustice that is happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now.","My hope, is that their words, and this epic mover, will inspire a real life hero to rise up, and help.","Thank you again, enjoy the show!","I think this is our cue to exit.","Guys, hey, what do you think?","Varrick Industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special.","I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.","Zhu Li, c'mon, we got guests!","Whip up a pot of that green tea I love!''","Of course!","I don't go anywhere without my assistant.","Do you?","Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened.","I did some good things, too.","Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?","I did.","Bolin, who got you into the movers?","I did.","Asami, who saved your company?","I did.","Mako, who got you thrown in jail!?","I did!","Oh yeah, guess that was a bad thing.","I wasn't going to hurt him.","I just needed to start a war.","Well, a bigger war.","The Future Industries' stuff?","It's on my battleship.","Of course I do!","I bought the first one they made!","Named her the \"Zhu Li\".","Yup.","They're both cold, heartless war machines.","Look, I'm truly sorry for the mess I caused.","Let me make it up to you, take Zhu Li.","My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it.","Zhu Li, commence \"Operation Winged Freedom\".","Do the thing!","Sorry we're late, everyone.","Great question, Asami.","I mean, what are any of us doing here?","Wow, food for thought.","Any who, how's our company doing?","''Allegedly'' plotted to abduct the President.","Never convicted.","No, the universe decided to set me free.","So, I looked up my old friend Suyin here, pitched her a few ideas, and ''bam''!","We're in business together.","I've seen the future, and the future is, ''magnets''!","I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it.","But that's not all, I'm- It worked!","Zhu Li, mark it down.","Magnet suit test successful.","Power down.","On to phase two: Zhu Li cleans up this mess.","Kid, can I give you some relationship advice?","Well, your loss.","Zhu Li!","bring the, uh, thing.","Check out my latest invention: an airbender finder.","It's not broken.","She needs to ''airbend'' into it!","How else do you expect the thing to work?","What was I doing last night?","Same thing I always do.","From nine to ten, I checked my body for ticks.","Lyme disease is a serious killer.","Then I did my nightly Varrick calisthenics, followed by thirty minutes of breath holding.","I filmed the whole thing if you want to watch it.","Maybe a little ''too'' overwhelming?","Collecting pumice stones with Zhu Li.","That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a nice exfoliating rock, and when you got callouses like mine, you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on.","Or in my case, ''feet''.","I was saying that I can smell a conspiracy when I see one.","Look, if I was trying to set someone up, I would tell everyone he's guilty and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof.","Yes, just like that!","Remember how great that worked?","Well, not for you.","That's great!","Zhu Li, dish out some of that special celebration tea!","Never thought I'd be allowed back in the Republic City Four Elements.","Raiko must have turned purple when Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes.","Upstanding is right!","And don't forget to fill the extra bag with as many of those little soaps as you can grab.","Love the lavender scent.","Relax, kid, what can they do?","Kuvira controls the whole nation now, and Republic City is ''begging'' for the metal that we're mining.","This train has left the station, and we own the track!","Now that's a nice looking hunk of spirit vine!","Let's take it back to the lab and get it stabilized immediately.","This is going to change ''everything!.''","Zhu Li!","Is this thing on?","Okay.","I'm Varrick, of Varrick Industries, International-- --and this is Spirit Vine Experiment 3-02.","Hand me the thing!","In this stasis capsule is a preserved spirit vine sample weighing approximately two \"Zhu Lis\".","I have postulated that these spirit vines are a form of pure energy that's unstable in what we call-- --\"typical earth conditions\".","This machine should transfer the energy from the vine into a battery using electrical currents, reverse magnetic polarity, and a little-known phenomenon I like to call-- --''the Varri-Effect''!","It's working!","It's registering five \"Varricks\" of power.","Now ''seven'' Varricks!","Whoa!","What is this?","What's going on?","Zhu Li!","Shut it down!","There are too many Varricks!","You're too heavy!","You know, you could stand to lose a few Zhu Lis!","Of ''course'' I saved you.","I can't clean this place up by ''myself!''","Grab a broom!","No!","We were spirit-vined!","But don't worry!","I'm putting the kibosh on this project.","Yes!","I do!","And that's why we gotta put an end to it!","What if it fell into the wrong hands?","I know, it's not like me, right?","Usually I look at a project like this and think, \"Wow!","I could make a ton of money off this!\"","But recently, I've been having these strange feelings ...","''inside.''","It's like I'm ... concerned with others.","And there's this nagging voice in my head constantly telling me what's right from wrong!","Sorry, no.","I just really gotta stand my ground on this one-- Whoa!","''No!","No!","Head voices are liars, what do head voices know?","I'll work on the project!","Please don't drop me!''","I can't believe Kuvira locked me in here like a ''prisoner''!","I'm not feeling well!","I think I'm running out of air!","Zhu Li, hold your breath!","''Great''!","Now we're both gonna die!","''Ahh!''","And the head voices are back!","Bolin!","Thank goodness you're here!","Where did that hatch come from?","''Forget the hatch!''","There's something important I gotta tell ya!","When I refused to build her a superweapon, ''she threatened my life!''","I couldn't agree more, kid.","We're not going to Zaofu, that place is ''doomed''!","We gotta head to Republic City!","We'll be helping by warning the world about Kuvira's potential ''superweapon!''","That's not ''the flamethrower!''","What ''idiot'' designed these things?","Less lecturing, more saving my life!","Hey!","I think I figured it out!","Thanks a ''lot'', Zhu Li.","Hey, come on!","I'm right here!","Think about what you're doing!","We're partners!","We have ''history!''","No!","Not the ''thing''!","''Zhu Li!''","Cookie ... jar ... empty.","No ... hot ... towels!","Waxy ... buildup!","''Zhu Li''!","Oh ... she really ''is'' gone.","Zhu Li always greeted me in the morning with a a hot cup of tea.","Well, I'm really only productive for about fifteen minutes a day, usually in the afternoon around three-forty-five.","I can't be expected to work without an assistant!","Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless!","Well, I guess he'll be fine.","As long as he doesn't need his ''hands'' afterwards!","The last time we worked with the spirit vines, it created an ''uncontrollable blast'' that burned through a wall and could still be blowing up comets in space, as far as I know!","I wouldn't want to assist me if ''I'' were you!","Bolin, do the thing.","''The thing''!","I never had to tell Zhu Li what ''thing''!","You know, when I started working with the vines, the point was to find a clean, unlimited source of energy, not develop some spirity death ray.","How would you know?","You couldn't discover a wolfbat if it was building a nest in your butt.","Ooh.","You got me there, Dr. Science.","You'll never know how it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped, and raised by ''fools''!","Okay, okay, The last time we ran the current through the vine we couldn't control the power, so I'm trying something new to see if I can ''direct'' it.","Hand me the ... screw-turn-thingy, would ya?","Funny story, Bolin.","I first got the idea for harnessing spirit power when I watched that giant Unalaq-monster attack the city from my jail cell.","That giant monster set me free!","Trust me, kid, I know what I'm doing.","That ought to do it.","Huh.","Okay, stand back.","There we go!","That's the timer.","For the ''bomb'', of course!","The ''bomb'' that's gonna explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train, all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards.","You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you.","This is the first time I've built a timer and it might run a little ''fast.''","Bolin and I are ready to go down with the ship, or ''train'', in this case, but you seem like you have a lot to live for.","Stick around five minutes and you'll find out who's bluffing.","You'll be sorry you left me, Zhu Li!","When they write the history books, your name will be synonymous with ''betrayal''!","People will say, \"Hey, what happened to that guy?","Oh, didn't you hear?","He 'Varricked' himself because some girl 'Zhu Li'd' him!\"","You try to pull me away from this thing and I'll hit this remote, and blow it immediately!","Well, first, I built the timer, but then I thought, you could drag me off the train, so then I built a remote, but then I thought, do I really need the timer, because now I got a remote in my-- ''Whatever!''","I'm covering all my bases!","The point is, you're leaving, we're staying!","That's good, we're almost out of time.","Ooh, we can't turn it off.","We're gonna blow up-- --but, we had a pretty good run, right?","I'll see you on the other side, Zhu Li.","''Yes''!","You did it, Bolin, you did the ''thing''!","You know, when I fled Republic City with Zhu Li, she carried me twenty miles in one day.","And that was after she sprained her ankle.","That's fine, leave me here, let the worms gobble me up.","I deserve it.","No, don't remind me!","I know, I'm a horrible, ''horrible'' person!","You really have a way with words, kid.","No wonder I made you a mover star.","All right, I'll take the driver's seat for a while, hop on.","Oh, boy, here we go!","You know who else has incisors sharp as a knife?","Zhu Li ... ''Lowly''?","We were part of Kuvira's inner circle!","Will you ''at least'' tell us where you're taking us?","Lava time!","Bet you didn't expect that!","Yeah.","If our handsome mugs get recognized trying to go through that checkpoint, we're goners!","Listen pal!","I had to fight off two badgermoles, six wolfbats and eighteen hog monkeys to capture these guys, so sorry if I don't have the paperwork!","I was too busy cramming it in a hog monkey's mouth, while it was trying to eat me!","I am in ''sore'' need of a shower and I have blisters that are the size of cantaloupes and twice as juicy!","So you can let us through, or you can give us your name and rank and I'll make sure to pass it on to Kuvira!","You know what happens to soldiers who question ''her'' orders, don't you?","''Bad stuff!''","Boy, I sure hope this works.","I still got that Varrick touch!","We're clear, come on!","It's been a blast!","On that hunk of junk?","No thanks.","I'm allergic to drowning.","I mean, uh, we'd love a lift!","Not me!","I've spent the last few hours tuning out all these incredibly boring stories ...","Both.","It's your true story, but we'll capitalize on the audience of the Nuktuk franchise.","Duh!","Nyahbabababab!","You're emphasizing the wrong story beads.","Let me tell it.","The story of Bolin begins in an exotic port of call.","A wise sage, the richest merchant in the world, and a handsome devil all sit on a single pillow in the living room of a luxury yacht!","How do they all fit on one pillow?","Wrong!","They're all the same man!","''Me!''","I try to teach a swami the power of levitation, but he's too stupid to understand it, so I kick him out.","\"Upon whom can I bestow my awesome knowledge?\"","I ask myself.","Then, in walks Nuktuk, with a twinkle in his eye, a gorgeous dame on his arm, and a song on his lips.","He bursts into a rapturous melody!","\"''Where can I find my teacher?''\"","You're on-screen talent, kid.","Leave the storytelling to the masters.","So, the trouble begins when the Avatar is trapped in the Spirit World.","The world's most evil villains realize that with Korra out of the way, the time is right to try to take out Bolin.","So, the worst of the worst team up.","They're led by ... ''Zaheer'', leader of the Red Lotus and master of the skies, a flying chaotic chaos machine!","He's joined by ... ''Vaatu'', the ultimate force of pure spirit evil in the universe.","The biggest, meanest, scariest ''kite'' that ever flew!","How do you think?","Amon!","The reanimated zombie body of the bloodbending leader of the Equalists!","The evil ''Unalaq''.","The diabolical but incredibly boring and unpopular sorcerer from the north, who's listening in on the other line!","Yes, Bolin had a reputation as the world's greatest ladies' man.","After leaving the beautiful but emotionally unstable Water Tribe princess at the altar, he met a fetching ''airbender'', the heir to a vast Earth Kingdom fortune!","And with danger closing in, Opal realizes how much she loves Bolin and forgives him for whatever stuff he was talking about earlier, which will probably not be in the final cut of the mover anyway.","And she ''kisses'' Bolin, magically passing on the airbender power of flight!","Never let the truth get in the way of a good story, kid!","Okay, I guess we should've opened with that line.","Yes!","How did you know?","If she figures out how to harness their power, we are ''all'' doomed.","It's nice to be welcomed back with open arms.","Allegedly.","I own that building!","A man has a right to blow up his own property!","What do you say, Asami?","Partners again?","It doesn't have a spirit ray.","I'm telling you what I told Kuvira: That technology should not be used!","Weld hotter!","Tighten tighter!","The president said we only have two weeks to get these hummingbirds ''humming''!","What is it?","I'm busy inspiring my workers.","Zhu Li.","Don't be so hard on yourself.","Apology accepted!","Now be a good assistant and man the assembly line!","''This'' is exactly why I didn't wanna build that weapon!","Guess Baatar Jr. is a better inventor than I thought.","Don't tell him I said that.","Well, you benders are going to have to fight her alone.","She just blew up our factory with all our hummingbird suits.","All right, let's fire it up again!","I did!","Twist harder!","I know how to take down some mecha suits and it just might take down that giant, too.","Asami, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back.","Zhu Li, let's go.","I know I can stop the mecha suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a ''giant'' mecha suit with a ''giant'' electromagnetic pulse.","Zhu Li, I've been thinking.","Yes.","But lately, I've been thinking about you.","I know we might not make it out of this mess and I feel like there are some things I should tell you.","I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich horse.","Named her Mrs. Beaks.","I grew up on a farm.","Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li?","This was before the circus people took me away.","Anyway, I loved old Mrs. Beaks, but I took her for granted.","Yes!","Dead in their tracks.","Oh, rats.","She's still coming.","Zhu Li, do the thing!","You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me?","I squash 'em!","Zhu Li?","I have something I need to attach before we take off.","I need to attach this ring to your finger.","Zhu Li Moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives?","Yes!","Now let's go attach these barely functional rust buckets to a giant killer smashing machine!","Aim for that spot in the middle of the back - the one I can never reach.","Wah, let's get out of here!","Wow!","I wish I had that kind of

three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages.","I'd like to make an announcement to the world: the Earth Kingdom is no more.","And from here on out, this man has no authority.","I have created a new Earth ''Empire'', and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for ''my'' people.","And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing: Anyone who crosses our borders or stands in our way, will be ''crushed.''","You look worried, Bolin.","You believe in the work that we've done for the people

them but neglect the people.","We have to stand strong against them.","That was just some ... tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business.","Believe me, conflict is the last thing I want.","Will you help me make history, Bolin?","Thank you.","Can you give us the room, please?","So ''now'' you're taking an interest in world affairs.","A little late, isn't it?","When the queen fell, and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu, and let others deal with the consequences.","I stepped ''up''.","I provide stability and equality.","Tell your world leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business.","We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.","Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.","From now on, developing this technology is your number one priority.","Don't get ahead of yourself.","Securing your hometown won't be like every other city.","''No''.","The eyes of the world are on us now.","We must do this ''right''.","That's why we need Bolin.","Su trusts him.","She'll listen to him.","What happened?","Were we attacked?","No, you're ''not''.","Do you realize what we could do with this kind of power?","Well, I'm the other voice in your head, and I'm telling you you will continue with this project.","And now there's a voice in ''my'' head telling me to drop you on the tracks.","''Should I listen?''","No.","In fact, I have good news.","We want you to be a part of our inner circle.","It means you've proven your worth.","We're so close to uniting the Empire, but Su has some resentment towards me and Baatar that might cloud her judgment and stop her from making a wise decision.","We believe you can help her see clearly.","Good.","Because we're here.","The army is here to project strength.","You're here to present peace.","Su, I didn't bring my army to threaten you.","I wanted to show you all that your son and I have accomplished.","''Ha!''","I didn't ''brainwash'' him!","I

force.''","When people don't cooperate, we must find other ways of convincing them to join.","It's not for you to worry about.","Those people are my loyal subjects, and they contribute to the Empire however I see fit.","Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths.","I didn't know your personal feelings for Opal were stronger than your loyalty to me.","Zaofu ''will'' join us.","The only thing I'm second-guessing is my decision to bring you along.","Maybe you need to spend some time in a reeducation camp.","Your loyalty seems to be wavering.","Suyin, I know this isn't my place, but I think you should do this.","Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone.","There are already wars.","The Earth Queen nearly destroyed our nation.","This is our opportunity to change things.","We're doing what you don't have the guts to do: We're going to Ba Sing Se to help bring order back to the Earth Kingdom.","And who's going to stop me?","Your security force was more than happy to join my cause.","They're some of the best fighters in the world, and they are tired of being treated like exotic birds in your cage.","When I choose to return, it'll be on my own terms.","Korra, it's such an honor to see you again.","The last I heard, you were still healing in the South Pole.","That's wonderful news.","I think we both know that's not going to happen.","Look, I was tasked with bringing stability to the Earth Kingdom.","Zaofu is the last holdout.","Why should I treat it differently than any other state?","I understand you're just trying to do Su a favor, but you can't come to me as I am on the verge of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop.","The world was descending into chaos while you were gone.","In order to fix it, I had to make some tough decisions.","Exactly.","Korra, if you really want to help, go back to Su and ''try'' to talk some sense into her.","Let's call a temporary truce.","I won't make any moves until you talk to her and get back to me.","Send these three away on the next train.","Bolin and Zhu Li will be going to the reeducation camp for our most severe dissenters.","And ''you'' will continue work on the spirit-energy project, under close, ''armed'' supervision.","I want it weaponized immediately.","Why would I?","You two could learn something from her.","Rise, Zhu Li.","I'll give you another chance.","I knew you'd try a sneak attack.","You were afraid to step up and lead the Earth Kingdom when you had the chance.","You were afraid to join me when I became the leader, and now, you're afraid of a fair fight.","You've always been a coward.","Take them!","Attention citizens of Zaofu.","Your leader, Su Beifong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept, ignoring the terms of our truce.","Luckily, I now have her and her assault team in custody.","Rest assured that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, unless your remaining representatives meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full and unconditional surrender of your city.","That is all.","If Su agrees to bow to me and turn over Zaofu, she and the rest of your family will not be harmed.","I've already laid out my terms, and I think they're very reasonable.","After all, Su did try to take me out during our ''peaceful ''negotiations.","Bolin is with my fianc\u00e9, working on something very important.","But, I assure you, he's on board with my plans.","You two have been apart for some time.","I guess you don't realize how much Bolin has grown up.","Now ''turn over Zaofu''.","Avatar Korra, you are interfering with internal Earth Empire business, and letting your ''personal'' feelings get in the way of reason.","Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself.","They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long.","I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation.","This is about equality.","The ''only way'' you're going to keep me from marching into Zaofu is if you ''physically'' stop me.","Now what are you going to do?","Looks like the Avatar's a little off her game!","Come on, Avatar, get up!","Show me what you've got!","I knew you were weak.","You broke our agreement!","Attack!","Zaofu is ours!","Bring the citizens of Zaofu to kneel before the Great Uniter!","All who pledge their loyalty to me will keep their freedom and will be dealt with fairly as full citizens of the Earth Empire.","The rest will be imprisoned as traitors, like Su Beifong and her sons.","Now ''bow''!","Are you sure, there's no way they survived?","How would you like to help Baatar build the most powerful weapon the world has ever seen?","Begin dismantling the domes.","Perfect.","Harvest the vines until there's nothing left.","I just wanted to check in to make sure everything was on track.","It looks wonderful.","You've been working on this the entire time, Zhu Li.","What do you think the problem is?","But you're doing everything you can to fix those, correct?","Tell the troops and the factory workers to attend tomorrow's demonstration.","I want them all to witness this incredible new weapon in action.","Congratulations on all of your hard work.","This weapon is proof that the Earth Empire is the strongest nation in the world.","And believe me, this is only the beginning!","Fire the weapon.","What's wrong?","And this could cause the entire weapon to fail?","What do you know about this?","You swore your loyalty to me and I gave you a chance at greatness.","This is how you repay me?!","Chain her up in the target town.","She can see how the weapon works up close and personal.","The prison.","Get there now!","I didn't come all this way to stop now.","Fire when ready.","I want to see that town destroyed.","Today, we stand on the precipice of history.","For the past three years, we've fought side by side to unite the Earth Empire and we've proven that no one can stand in our way, not even the Avatar.","But our mission is not yet complete.","There is a grave injustice that must be corrected.","As you all know, after the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang, along with Fire Lord Zuko, stole Earth Empire land and formed the United Republic.","This land belongs to the people of the Earth Empire and it's time to take it back!","Republic City will be ours!","Are you ready to show the world what a true superpower looks like?","I never could have done this without your help.","After we claim victory, we can finally get married and rule our empire together.","The Avatar.","You're in no position to give orders.","I don't think you understand the power I possess.","Let me make it clear.","You have three seconds before I wipe out your army.","Time's up!","Good.","Turn your army

happened?","Are we ... dead?","Why would you save my life, after everything I did to you?","We are nothing alike!","This wasn't how I wanted things to end.","If you would have all just surrendered,

king.","Don't let my reputation intimidate you.","I'm still human just like everyone else.","Only more human, like, extra human, or, hmm, ''superhuman''.","So, what do you say?","Can I show you a low-key night out with a superhuman soon-to-be king?","Now?","Fine.","Think over the offer.","I'll be back.","Right.","About that.","Are we all positive that the Earth Kingdom is safe enough for me to return?","I don't have to remind everyone what happened to my great-aunt three years ago?!","May she rest in peace.","Uh ... define \"pretty much\".","Mostly?","''Almost''?","Because I'm not just getting a haircut, it's a spa day!","We're talking minimum four hours.","A rejuvenating tea-leaf skin wrap.","Have you ever gotten one of those, Mako?","You will be.","So while your hands soak in a bubbling milk-bath, your feet are in a tub full of these little sucker-fish that literally eat your calluses away.","Gobble them right up!","Crazy, huh?","Then, they scrape your skin with blocks of sea-salt and lube you up with seaweed-infused aloe, wrap you in tea leaves, put you in a hot box for four hours, and ''bam''!","You're done!","Mako, look at all my fans!","They must be in town for my coronation.","What just happened out there?","Oh no!","Mako, I've been hit!","It's a ''gusher''!","Oh.","Yeah, you're right.","But that was close.","I don't know what would have happened if you weren't there.","Or I could have been killed!","I don't know what I'd ever do without you!","Wait a second.","Did you say ''strawberry'' pie?","I'm allergic to strawberries!","I don't think I can breathe!","Get me to the hospital!","Wu down!","You've never had the tea leaf wrap?","You have no idea what you're missing.","The face massage ''alone'' is to die for.","So then the crowds are gathered, all excited to see ''my'' coronation, when all of a sudden, these ''boulders'' come rolling through.","And guess what pops out of 'em?","Earthbender dames!","These gals start banging the boulders like drums, and sing the song of my royal lineage.","It's the most dynamite six-hour show you'll ever see in your life.","Now, now, now, don't get yourself in a ''tizzy''.","I'll have ministers for all that!","No, sir, Mako, when we get to Ba Sing Se, it'll just be two kooky pals, living the life!","I hope I'm not out of order saying this: You're pretty easy on the eyes for a military type.","I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff, maybe get you a little upgrade.","I've been living here for years, they love me.","Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop!","See, ''I'm'' in the presidential suite.","Wait, what?","Cam, where's all my stuff?","Junior suite?","Where have you been?","My coronation is in ten minutes!","Where's everyone else?","Where are the Seven Sacred Chests of Exquisite Finery?","Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?","There's no crown?!","How can you have a coronation without a crown?","How will people know when I'm officially the king?","An earring?","Are you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles?","No acrobat bell ringers, no horn blowing announcery guy?","Don't ... ''touch me''.","Thank you, for that incredibly brief, but very moving ceremony.","I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen, who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne.","One of them deserves special attention.","Kuvira, rise!","For your service to the realm, I would like to present you with the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest honor, which was somehow ''not'' stolen, unlike the royal pinky rings.","Why not?","We've got ''six hours'' to fill ...","Wait, what?","But I just got the royal brooch!","Worst coronation ever.","First I lose my suite, then I lose my throne.","My royal brooch is a ''lie!''","I know you must be crushed, not getting to come back to Ba Sing Se with me.","Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy.","Okay.","I just have to go on, move forward, take decisive action.","Let's go shopping!","Ugh.","Get rid of him.","He's with ''her''.","Sorry, sport, I heard it all.","I know!","Insulting another man's suite?","It's beneath low.","But I think I know what would cheer you up: a visit to Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall!","I'll buy you a smoothie.","Once we're done with these, we can go into the Middle Ring and I'll let you pick out some new suits, then we'll hit the boutiques in the Upper Ring for me.","Where did you get those shirts?","You can't sell that junk in here!","This is the Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall, and I'm the Little King here!","Respect the brooch!","I am the Glorious Defender!","It's destiny.","Look where we are, Mako!","''The Royal Palace.''","It's my coronation day!","You'll have another birthday next year, but I'll never have this day back again!","''Never''!","This is the worst day of my ''life''!","No, you're right.","No one ever talked to me like that before.","I guess I'm just a joke who got what he deserved.","Carry me?","Hello there, Prince Wu, rightful heir to the throne and this guy's boss.","I bet he's told you a lot about me.","Then we have ''so'' much to talk about.","You are going to ''love'' the food here, I know the chef personally.","Let's start with a round of your spicy octopus fritters and keep the cucumber-aloe water coming!","Gotta keep this princely skin hydrated.","Hey, pop into the Avatar State for me.","I want to see your eyes glow.","Mako, if it makes you feel any better, she didn't write me either.","As much as I'm enjoying this little catch-up, my royal bladder is about to ''explode''.","Mako, come on, I need you to stand guard.","Fine.","Make it a double, buddy!","Mako, help!","Wu ... down ... Hmm, I'm in laundry ... Mako?","Where am I?","Am I dead?","I'm not going up there.","Yes!","Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.","You are definitely getting a raise, Buddy.","I owe you my life, Avatar.","If only there was some way to repay you.","Oh, I know.","How about I take you out for a night on the town?","So ...","I put you down for a \"maybe\"?","You guys are the greatest friends a guy could have.","Whoo!","You're telling me!","I need a cushy safe house somewhere.","Nice digs, Mako.","You didn't tell me you came from money.","It's an honor, Grandma Mako.","I think I'll fit right in here.","Thanks for looking out for me, Mako.","Now where's the nearest bathroom?","I have been holding it all day!","You know, there's something about being kidnapped that makes a guy realize he needs to get his act together.","''Daaah'', I wasn't ready!","Wu down!","And maybe some of those sticky dumplings, too?","I know, I'm a wimp.","But it's not my fault, I was ''born'' that way!","I'm not like you Mako, I wasn't raised by a pack of cops in the woods.","Yeah, I'm drawing a blank.","Why is that?","How do I not ''know'' stuff about you?","Well, I'm asking now!","What's your favorite food?","What's your favorite color?","Is there a special lady in your life?","What?","''You dated the Avatar''?","Sit!","You and I need to have a little gab session ''right now!''","How'd you guys first meet?","Carry on.","Whoa!","That was the first time you met?","Kind of rude there, buddy!","So then you smooched her real good, eh?","Wait.","That was the first thing you said to Asami?","You ''really'' gotta work on your introductions.","That's harsh, Mako.","Hoo!","I bet Asami wasn't too happy about ''that.''","Ouch!","Fine.","But I hope you weren't as ambiguous with Korra as you were with Asami.","Now ''that's'' a breakup!","No, actually, I'm completely fine with that.","You officially broke up with Korra and therefore, you're free to smooch whoever you wish.","Whoa, whoa, whoa!","So you were back with Asami, but then Korra came back and thought you guys were still together and you didn't tell her you ''weren't''?","Truer words have never been spoken.","High-five!","I know what that's like.","I mean, to need distance from women.","Because I have so many, all over me, all the time.","Wow!","That story is amazing and I ''really'' learned something!","Yeah!","I learned that I ''really'' didn't know anything about you!","Crazy!","Also, I realized that ladies are complicated.","No offense, Grandma.","I better just focus on being a better king.","Okay, come at me.","I can take it.","Aahhhhh!","Wu down!","Okay, maybe while the weapon geniuses and the spirit bridge are getting ready for battle, we should be evacuating the ordinary citizens so that if Kuvira attacks, they won't be hurt.","Thanks.","And if Korra buys this \"man of the people\" thing, I still might get to date her.","What?","Come on!","Why do you think guys do anything great?","To pick up girls.","Every work of art, every song, every city evacuation, all for the ladies.","Could be better.","At this point we've evacuated almost ... eighteen families.","I said it could be better.","Listen everyone, I can get us out of here if you just sit tight.","Can you step off the bench, please?","It's a little crowded up here.","Just stay calm.","I'll be right back.","Come on.","I'm going to get some help.","You think you can handle this unruly mob for a little while?","The zoo!","Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!","They're the best earthbenders around!","We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us.","Badgermoles, digging holes, under Republic City.","Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty.","Oh, Yin, you're the sweetest evacuee I've ever known.","And I just want to thank you for being so kind, when I was living in your home.","You don't need these people.","They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm Prince Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom.","Take me to Kuvira.","I've got business with her.","I have to.","But before I go, I'd like to sing you a song.","If you don't respect the broach, you don't respect me.","Oh, no, no, no, no, no.","You're no better than a roach, but I'm royalty.","I got my badgermoles with me.","You don't know what you're talking about.","Oh, badgermoles I love you, I love you.","I want to, I want to pet your snouts.","That's okay, Mako.","Sometimes, a good evacuation is its own reward.","Yeah ... about that ...","I was actually thinking of stepping down as king and getting rid of the monarchy all together.","For once, I'm not.","Now I know what you're gonna say, I'm being lazy, I'm afraid of responsibility, I'm putting my singing career before my people, but it's none of those things.","I really think the Earth Kingdom would be better off if the states were independent and had elected leaders, like the United Republic.","Looking forward to working with you.","But for now, the dance floor calls."]},"Governor":{"combined_dialog":["You finally made it!","So where are
