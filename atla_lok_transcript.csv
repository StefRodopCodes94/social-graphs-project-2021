0,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"It's not getting away from me this time. Watch and learn, Katara. ''This'' is how you catch a fish."
1,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Sokka, look!"
2,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"But, Sokka! I caught one!"
3,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Hey!
4,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Why is it that every time ''you'' play with magic water, ''I'' get soaked?"
5,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Yeah, yeah, ""an ancient art unique to our culture"", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself."
6,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,You're calling ''me'' weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!
7,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Watch out! Go left! Go left!
8,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,You call that ''left?''
9,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've ''waterbended'' us out of the ice."
10,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,So it's my fault?
11,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Ever since mom died, ''I've'' been doing all the work around camp while ''you've'' been off playing soldier!"
12,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,Uh ... Katara ...
13,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, ''not pleasant!''"
14,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Katara, settle down!"
15,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"No that's it! I'm ''done'' helping you! From now on, you're ''on your own!''"
16,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Okay, you've gone from ""weird"" to ""freakish"", Katara."
17,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,You mean ''I ''did that?
18,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,Yep. Congratulations.
19,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,He's alive! We have to help!
20,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Katara, get back here! We don't know what that ''thing'' is!"
21,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Zuko,"Finally! Uncle, do you realize what this means?!"
22,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Iroh,I won't get to finish my game?
23,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Zuko,It means my search is about to come to an end.
24,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Zuko,That light came from an ''incredibly'' powerful source! It has to be him!
25,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Iroh,"Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?"
26,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Zuko,"I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar! Helmsman, head a course for the light!"
27,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,Stop!
28,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Stop it!
29,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,I need to ask you something ...
30,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,What?
31,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Please ... come closer.
32,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,What is it?
33,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Will you go penguin sledding with me?
34,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Uh, sure ... I-I guess."
35,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,What's going on here?
36,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,You tell us! How did you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen?
37,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,I'm not sure.
38,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy."
39,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Ha, ha! You're okay!"
40,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,What ''is'' that thing?
41,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"This is Appa, my flying bison."
42,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister."
43,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Don't worry, it'll wash out. So do you guys live around here?"
44,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,''Don't ''answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light?! He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy!
45,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Oh yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that ''evil'' look in his eye. The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name."
46,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo! I'm Aang.
47,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,You just sneezed ... and flew ten feet in the air!
48,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Really? It felt higher than that.
49,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,You're an airbender!
50,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Sure am!
51,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Giant light beams, flying bison, airbenders ... I think I got midnight sun madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense."
52,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Well, if you guys are stuck, Appa and I can give you a lift."
53,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,We'd love a ride! Thanks!
54,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,Oh no! I'm not getting on that fluffy ''snot'' monster!
55,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know, before you ''freeze'' to death?"
56,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Okay, first time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip-yip!"
57,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Come on, Appa. Yip-yip!"
58,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Wow, that was ''truly'' amazing ..."
59,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Appa's just a little tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.
60,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Why are you smiling at me like that?
61,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Oh, I was smiling?"
62,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Iroh,"I'm going to bed now. Yep, a man needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed."
63,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Zuko,Because their ''honor'' didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine ''does.'' This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.
64,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Hey.
65,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Hey. What'cha thinkin' about?
66,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"I guess I was wondering, your being an airbender and all, if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar?"
67,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Oh, no. I didn't know him. I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry."
68,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Okay. Just curious. Good night.
69,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Sleep tight.
70,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Aang? Aang! Wake up. It's okay, we're in the village now! Come on, get ready. Everyone's waiting to meet you."
71,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Aang, ''this'' is the entire village. Entire village, Aang."
72,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Uh, why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?"
73,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Kanna,"Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We thought they were extinct, until my granddaughter and grandson found you."
74,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Extinct?
75,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Aang, this is my grandmother."
76,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Kanna,Call me Gran-Gran.
77,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"What is this, a weapon? You can't ''stab'' anything with this!"
78,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending.
79,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Village girl,Magic trick! Do it again!
80,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly."
81,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Ya know, last time I checked, humans ''can't fly!''"
82,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Check again!
83,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Village girl,He's flying!
84,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Village girl,It's amazing!
85,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,My watchtower!
86,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,That was ''amazing!''
87,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender. Together you can just waste time ''all'' day long."
88,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,You're a waterbender?
89,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Well, sort of. Not yet."
90,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Kanna,"All right, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores."
91,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me!"
92,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Kanna,"Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy."
93,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,But he's special! I can tell! I sense he's filled with ''much'' wisdom.
94,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!
95,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Iroh,Again.
96,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Iroh,"No! Power in firebending comes from the breath , not the muscles. The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire! Get it right this time."
97,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Zuko,Enough! I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set! I'm ''more'' than ready!
98,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Iroh,"No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics. Drill it again!"
99,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Zuko,The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements! I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. You ''will'' teach me the advanced set!
100,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Iroh,"Very well, but first, I must finish my roast duck."
101,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?"
102,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Southern Water Tribe boy,I gotta pee!
103,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on ''you'' to be the men of this tribe, and that means ''no potty breaks''!"
104,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Southern Water Tribe boy,But I really gotta go!
105,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Okay, who else has to go?"
106,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over ''an hour'' ago.
107,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Wow! ''Everything'' freezes in there!
108,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"Uh! Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors ''only''!"
109,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Village boy,Whee!
110,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,Stop! Stop it right now! What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with ''the War'' going on!
111,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,What war? What are you talking about?
112,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"You're kidding, right?"
113,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Penguin!
114,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Sokka,"He's kidding, right?"
115,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Aang?
116,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding? Heh heh. I have a way with animals."
117,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Hehehe, Aang, I'll help ''you'' catch a penguin if you teach ''me'' waterbending."
118,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"You got a deal! Just one little problem ... I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?"
119,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,No. You're looking at the ''only'' waterbender in the whole South Pole.
120,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you."
121,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Maybe, but we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly ""turn right at the second glacier"". It's on the other side of ''the world''."
122,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"But you forget, ''I'' have a flying bison. Appa and I can ''personally'' fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master!"
123,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before."
124,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me catch one of these penguins?"
125,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Okay, listen closely my young pupil. Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe!"
126,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha!"
127,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,I haven't done this since I was a kid!
128,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,You still ''are'' a kid!
129,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Whoa! What is ''that?''
130,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people. Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!"
131,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"If you want to be a bender, you ''have'' to let go of fear."
132,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.
133,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"Okay, back up. I have friends ''all over'' the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen ''any'' war."
134,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?"
135,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,"I don't know. A few days, maybe?"
136,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,I think it was more like a hundred'' years!''
137,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you?
138,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time! It's the only explanation."
139,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,A hundred years! I can't believe it.
140,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ..."
141,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,I ''did'' get to meet you.
142,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Come on, let's get out of here."
143,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,"Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy."
144,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Huh?
145,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,What's that you said about booby traps?
146,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Aang,Uh oh ... Hold on tight!
147,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Katara,Aaah!
148,1,The Boy in the Iceberg,Water,1,1,Zuko,The last airbender! Quite agile for his old age. Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar. As ''well'' as his hiding place ...
149,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world."
150,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Village kids,Yay! Aang's back!
151,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?"
152,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Aang didn't do anything! It was an accident.
153,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Yeah. We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well -- -- we booby-ed right into it."
154,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Kanna,"Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship! Now we could ''all'' be in danger!"
155,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,Don't blame Katara. I brought her there. It's my fault.
156,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy. The foreigner is banished from our village."
157,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Sokka, you're making a mistake."
158,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"No, I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you, from threats like him!"
159,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Aang is ''not'' our enemy! Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun.
160,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Fun?! We can't fight firebenders with fun!
161,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,You should try it sometime.
162,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Get out of our village! ''Now!''
163,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Grandmother, please. ''Don't'' let Sokka do this!"
164,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Kanna,"Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves."
165,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Fine! Then I'm banished, too! Come on Aang, let's go."
166,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Where do you think ''you're'' going?
167,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,To find a waterbender. Aang is taking ''me'' to the North Pole.
168,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,I am? Great!
169,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family?
170,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family."
171,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?"
172,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,Thanks for penguin sledding with me.
173,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Where will you go?
174,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders. Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to ''that.'' It was nice meeting everyone."
175,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Let's see your bison fly now, ''air boy.''"
176,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Come on Appa, you can do it. Yip-yip!"
177,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Yeah, I thought so!"
178,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Southern Water Tribe girl,"Ahhh! Aang, don't go! I'll miss you!"
179,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"I'll miss you, too. Come on, boy."
180,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Kanna,"Katara, you'll feel better after you-"
181,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,You happy now? There goes my ''one ''chance at becoming a waterbender!
182,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"All right, ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!"
183,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Southern Water Tribe boy,But I gotta ...
184,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Oh man!
185,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Oh maaan ...
186,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Sokka, get out of the way!"
187,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,Where are you hiding him?
188,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,I ''know'' you're hiding him!
189,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Village boy,Show no fear!
190,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka."
191,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Hi, Aang. Thanks for coming."
192,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,Looking for me?
193,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,''You're'' the airbender? ''You're'' the Avatar?
194,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Aang?
195,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,No way!
196,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,"I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training, meditating. You're just a child!"
197,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Well, you're just a teenager."
198,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?"
199,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"No! Aang, ''don't'' do this!"
200,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Don't worry, Katara. It'll be okay. Take care of Appa for me until I get back."
201,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,Head a course for the Fire Nation. I'm going home.
202,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him."
203,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Katara, I --"
204,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will. I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and --"
205,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Katara! Are you gonna talk all day, or are you comin' with me?"
206,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Sokka!
207,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Get in, we're going to save your boyfriend."
208,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,He's not my --
209,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Whatever.
210,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Kanna,What do you two think you're doing?
211,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Yeah, okay Gran."
212,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Kanna,Aang is the Avatar. He's the world's only chance. You both found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his.
213,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,There's no way we're going to catch a warship with a ''canoe.''
214,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Appa!
215,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"You just looove taking me out of my comfort zone, don't you?"
216,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,"This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the Avatar to the prison hold, and take this to my quarters."
217,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"So, I guess you've never fought an airbender before. I bet I could take you ''both ''with my hands tied behind my back."
218,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Firebender,Silence.
219,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Firebender,The Avatar has escaped!
220,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Go. Fly. Soar.
221,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Please, Appa. We need your help. ''Aang'' needs your help."
222,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Up. Ascend. Elevate.
223,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa. Come on, don't you want to save Aang?"
224,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,What was it that kid said? Yee-haw? Hup-hup? Wah-hoo? Uh ... Yip-yip?
225,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"You did it, Sokka!"
226,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's -"
227,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"I mean, big deal. He's flying."
228,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"You haven't seen my staff around, have you?"
229,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,Thanks anyway!
230,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,Sorry!
231,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,My staff!
232,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,Looks like I underestimated you.
233,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,What is that?
234,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,Appa!
235,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Aang! No!
236,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Aang! Aang! Aang!
237,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Did you see what he just did?!
238,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Now ''that'' was some waterbending!
239,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Aang! Are you okay?
240,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka. Thanks for coming."
241,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"Well, I couldn't let you have ''all'' the glory."
242,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,I dropped my staff.
243,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Got it!
244,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!
245,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,Katara!
246,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Hurry up, Sokka!"
247,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,"I'm just a guy, with a boomerang. I didn't ask for all this flying and ''magic!'' Yip-yip! Yip-yip!"
248,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Iroh,Duh? Huh?
249,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,Shoot them down!
250,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Iroh,Good news for the Fire Lord. The Fire Nation's greatest ''threat'' is just a little kid.
251,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,"That ""kid"", Uncle, just did ''this.'' I won't underestimate him again. Dig the ship out and follow them!"
252,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Zuko,As soon as you're done with that.
253,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,How did you do that?! With the water? It was the most ''amazing'' thing I've ''ever'' seen!
254,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,I don't know. I just sort of ... did it.
255,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Why didn't you tell us ''you'' were the Avatar?
256,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"But Aang, the world's been ''waiting'' for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war."
257,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,And how am I going to do that?
258,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?"
259,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,That's what the monks told me.
260,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,"Well, if we go to the North Pole, you can master waterbending!"
261,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,We can learn it together!
262,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Sokka,I'd like that. I'd ''reeally'' like that.
263,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,Then we're in this together!
264,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some ''serious'' business to attend to. Here, here and here."
265,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Katara,What's there?
266,1,The Avatar Returns,Water,1,2,Aang,"Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas. Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys. They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!"
267,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"Wait 'til you see it, Katara! The Air Temple is one of the most ''beautiful'' places in the world!"
268,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"Aang, I know you're excited, but it's been a hundred years since you've been home."
269,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,That's ''why'' I'm so excited!
270,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,It's just that ... a lot can change in all that time.
271,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"I know, but I need to see it for myself."
272,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple, here we come!"
273,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Uggh! Sleep now. Temple later.
274,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Sokka! Wake up! There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!
275,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Ahh! Get it off! Get it off! Ahh!
276,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Great! You're awake! Let's go!
277,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible. I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail."
278,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,You mean the Avatar?
279,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"Don't mention his name on these docks! Once word gets out that he's alive, every firebender will be out looking for him, and I don't want anyone getting in the way!"
280,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"Getting in the way of what, Prince Zuko?"
281,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,Captain Zhao.
282,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,It's ''commander'' now. And General Iroh. Great hero of our nation.
283,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,''Retired'' general.
284,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests anytime. What brings you to my harbor?
285,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,Our ship is being repaired.
286,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,That's quite a bit of damage.
287,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,Yes. You wouldn't believe what happened. Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened.
288,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,Yes. I will do that. It was incredible! What? Did we crash or something?
289,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,Yes! Right into ... an Earth Kingdom ship!
290,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,Really? You must regale me with all of the'' thrilling'' details. Join me for a drink?
291,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"Sorry, but we have to go."
292,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,"Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect. We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite."
293,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,"Hey, stomach? Be quiet, all right? I'm'' trying'' to find us some food."
294,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Hey! Who ate all of my blubbered seal jerky?!
295,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Oh. That was food? I used it to start the campfire last night. Sorry.
296,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,You ''what''?! No wonder the flames smelled so good.
297,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,The Patola Mountain range! We're almost there!
298,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders."
299,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,What about 'em?
300,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people."
301,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They probably escaped!"
302,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,I know it's hard to accept.
303,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison! Right, Appa?"
304,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Yip yip!
305,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,There it is. The Southern Air Temple.
306,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"Aang, it's amazing!"
307,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"We're home, buddy! We're home."
308,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"... And by the year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital will be under our rule. The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war."
309,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool!"
310,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue. So, how is your search for the Avatar going?"
311,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,"Eh.. My fault, entirely."
312,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,We haven't found him yet.
313,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,Did you really expect to? The Avatar ''died'' a hundred years ago. Along with the rest of the airbenders. Unless you have found some evidence that the Avatar is alive?
314,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,No. Nothing.
315,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"Prince Zuko, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war. If you have an ''ounce'' of loyalty left, you'll tell me what you found."
316,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"I haven't found anything. It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago. Come on, Uncle, we're going."
317,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Soldier,"Commander Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed. They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody, but let him escape."
318,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"Now remind me, how, ''exactly'', was your ship damaged?"
319,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,So where do I get something to eat?
320,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"You're lucky enough to be one of the'' first'' outsiders to ''ever'' visit an airbender temple, and all you can think about is food?"
321,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,"I'm just a simple guy, with simple needs."
322,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"So that's where my friends and I would play airball, and over there is where the bison would sleep, and ..."
323,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,What's wrong?
324,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,"So uh, this airball game. How do you play?"
325,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"Aang, seven! Sokka, zero!"
326,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,"Making him feel better is putting ''me'' in a world of hurt. Katara, check this out."
327,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Fire Nation.
328,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,We should tell him.
329,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Aang! There's something you need to see.
330,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Okay!
331,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,What is it?
332,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Uh ... Just a new waterbending move I learned.
333,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"Nice one! But enough practicing, we have a whole temple to see!"
334,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,"You know, you can't protect him forever."
335,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"I can for Aang's sake. If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated."
336,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Hey guys! I want you to meet somebody!
337,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Who's that?
338,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Monk Gyatso! The greatest airbender in the world. He taught me everything I know.
339,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Gyatso,"But the true secret, is in the gooey center."
340,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Hmm ...
341,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Gyatso,"My ancient cake-making technique isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang?"
342,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"This whole Avatar thing, m-maybe the monks made a mistake."
343,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Gyatso,"The only mistake they made was telling you before you turned sixteen, but we can't concern ourselves with what was. We must act on what is."
344,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,But Gyatso? How do I know if I'm ready for this?
345,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Gyatso,"Your questions will be answered when you're old enough to enter the air temple sanctuary. Inside, you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey."
346,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Who is it?
347,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Gyatso,"When you are ready, he will reveal himself to you. Now, are you going to help me with these cakes, or not?"
348,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,All right.
349,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Gyatso,One. Two. Three!
350,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Gyatso,"Your aim has improved greatly, my young pupil."
351,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,You must miss him.
352,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Yeah.
353,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Where are you going?
354,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,The air temple sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet.
355,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"But Aang, no one could have survived in there for a hundred years."
356,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,It's not impossible. I survived in the iceberg for that long.
357,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Good point.
358,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"Katara, whoever's in there might help figure out this Avatar thing!"
359,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,And whoever's in there might have a medley of delicious cured meats!
360,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,I don't suppose you have a key?
361,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"The key, Sokka, is airbending."
362,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Hello? Anyone home?
363,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,So a twelve-year-old boy bested you and your firebenders. You're more pathetic than I thought.
364,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"I underestimated him ''once'', but it will ''not'' happen again!"
365,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"No, it will not. Because you won't have a second chance."
366,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"Commander Zhao, I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I -"
367,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,And you failed! Capturing the Avatar is too important to leave in a teenager's hands. He's mine now.
368,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,Keep them here.
369,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,"More tea, please."
370,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Statues? That's it? Where's the meat?
371,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Who are all these people?
372,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,I'm not sure. But it feels like I know them somehow. Look! That one's an airbender.
373,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"And this one's a waterbender. They're lined up in a pattern: air, water, earth and fire."
374,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,That's the Avatar Cycle.
375,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"Of course. They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang."
376,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Wow! There are so many!
377,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,"Past lives? Katara, you really believe in that stuff?"
378,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,"It's true. When the Avatar dies, he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle."
379,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Aang! Snap out of it!
380,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Huh?
381,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Who is that?
382,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me."
383,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.
384,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,There's no writing. How do you know his name?
385,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,I'm not sure. I just know it somehow.
386,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,You just couldn't get any weirder.
387,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Firebender. Nobody make a sound.
388,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,You're making a sound!
389,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang and Sokka,Shhhh!
390,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,That firebender won't know what hit him.
391,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Lemur!
392,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Dinner!
393,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Don't listen to him. You're going to be my new pet.
394,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Not if I get him first!
395,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,I want to eat you!
396,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Hey! No fair!
397,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"My search party is ready. Once I'm out to sea, my guards will escort you back to your ship and you'll be free to go."
398,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,Why? Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?
399,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,You? Stop me? Impossible.
400,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"Don't underestimate me, Zhao! I will capture the Avatar before you!"
401,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"You can't compete with me. I have hundreds of war ships under my command and you? You're just a banished prince. No home, no allies. Your own father doesn't even want you."
402,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"You're wrong! Once I deliver the Avatar to my father, he will welcome me home with honor, and restore my rightful place on the throne!"
403,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,"If your father really wanted you home, he would have let you return by now, Avatar or no Avatar. But in his eyes you are a failure and a disgrace to the Fire Nation."
404,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,That's not true.
405,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,You have the scar to prove it.
406,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,Maybe you'd like one to match!
407,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,Is that a challenge?
408,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,An Agni Kai. At sunset.
409,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,Very well. It's a shame your father won't be here to watch me humiliate you. I guess your uncle will do.
410,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,"Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?"
411,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,I will never forget.
412,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"Hey! Come back! Come on out, little lemur! That hungry guy won't bother you anymore."
413,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Firebenders? They were here?
414,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Gyatso.
415,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,"Hey, Aang! You find my dinner yet? Aang, I wasn't ''really'' going to eat the lemur, okay? Oh, man. Come on, Aang. Everything will be all right. Let's get out of here."
416,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Aang!
417,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Fire Sage,Send word to the Fire Lord immediately! The Avatar has returned!
418,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Aang! Come on! Snap out of it!
419,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Aaaaahh!
420,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,What happened?
421,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,He found out firebenders killed Gyatso!
422,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Oh no! It's his Avatar Spirit! He must have triggered it! I'm going to try and calm him down!
423,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,"Well, do it! Before he blows us off the mountain!"
424,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,"Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons."
425,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,I refuse to let him win.
426,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,This will be over quickly.
427,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,"Basics, Zuko! Break his root!"
428,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,Do it!
429,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zhao,That's it? Your father raised a coward.
430,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"Next time you get in my way, I promise, I won't hold back."
431,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,"No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory. So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat? Disgraceful. Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you. Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious."
432,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Zuko,"Did you really mean that, Uncle?"
433,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Iroh,Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.
434,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise.
435,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,I'm sorry.
436,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,It's okay. It wasn't your fault.
437,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"But you were right. And if the firebenders found this temple, that means they found the other ones, too. I really am the last airbender."
438,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Everything's packed. You ready to go?
439,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?
440,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,Maybe you'll find a way.
441,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Looks like you made a new friend Sokka!
442,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Sokka,Can't talk! Must eat!
443,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,"Hey, little guy!"
444,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Katara,What are you going to name him?
445,1,The Southern Air Temple,Water,1,3,Aang,Momo.
446,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,"The only reason you should be interrupting me, is if you have news about the Avatar."
447,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Iroh,"Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset."
448,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,"Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now, whatever you have to say, I'm sure I can take it."
449,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Iroh,Okay then. We have no idea where he is.
450,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,What!?
451,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Iroh,You really should open a window in here.
452,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,Give me the map!
453,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Iroh,"Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down."
454,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"You have no idea where you're going, do you?"
455,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Well ... I know it's near water.
456,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,I guess we're getting close then.
457,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Momo, marbles please. Hey Katara, check out this airbending trick!"
458,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"That's great, Aang."
459,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,You didn't even look.
460,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,That's great!
461,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,But I'm not doing it now.
462,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing."
463,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. It's just the natural order of things.
464,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did!
465,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Wait! I was just kidding. I can't wear these! Katara, please!"
466,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants."
467,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?
468,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"He's right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring."
469,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"But Appa's tired, aren't you boy?"
470,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"I ''said, ''aren't you boy?"
471,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Yeah, that was ''real ''convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical monster."
472,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Look!
473,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"That's why we're here. Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it. Katara, you've got to watch me!"
474,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Cold!
475,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Hahaha, hahaha!"
476,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Whooh!
477,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,He looks pretty good out there.
478,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.
479,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"No, Appa. Don't eat that!"
480,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Oh man ...
481,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,There's something in the water!
482,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,What's wrong?
483,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Aang's in trouble. Aang!
484,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Get out of there!
485,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Get back here, Aang!"
486,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Whaaaahh! Aaaah!
487,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Whaaaahh!
488,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,What was that thing?
489,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,I don't know.
490,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Well, let's not stick around to find out. Time to hit the road."
491,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Or, we could stay a while."
492,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Oyaji,You three have some explaining to do.
493,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,"And if you don't answer all our questions, we're throwing you back in the water with the Unagi."
494,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Show yourselves, cowards!"
495,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?
496,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,"There were no men. We ambushed you. Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?"
497,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down."
498,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,"A bunch of girls, huh? The Unagi's gonna eat well tonight."
499,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes."
500,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.
501,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Oyaji,How do we know you're not Fire Nation spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!
502,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!
503,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Oyaji,Ha! How could you possibly know her?
504,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Oyaji,Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. She's been dead for centuries.
505,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,I know her because I'm the Avatar.
506,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,That's impossible! The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.
507,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,That's me!
508,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Oyaji,Throw the impostor to the Unagi!
509,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Aang ... do some airbending.
510,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Spectators,Wow! Did you see that? Airbender!
511,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Oyaji,It's true ... you ''are'' the Avatar!
512,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Now ... check this out!
513,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Little girl,Did you hear the news? The Avatar's on Kyoshi!
514,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Fisherman,Huh?
515,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,"The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island? Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not getting away from me this time."
516,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Iroh,Are you going to finish that?
517,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,I was going to save it for later!
518,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,All right! Dessert for breakfast!
519,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!
520,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Mmm ... Katara you've got to try these!
521,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Well, maybe just a bite."
522,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Sokka, what's your problem? ''Eat!''"
523,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Not hungry.
524,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.
525,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,They snuck up on me!
526,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Right. And ''then'' they kicked your butt.
527,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Sneak attacks don't count! Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls. Who do they think they are anyway? Mmm ... this is tasty.
528,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,What's he so angry about? It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment!
529,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long."
530,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town? They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!"
531,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. I just hope it doesn't all go to your head."
532,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk."
533,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Painter,"Hmmm ... Painting the Avatar ... that's easy enough ... Oh, there's another one ... Well, I'll make an adjustment here, and ... There's more ... well that ..."
534,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,I can't believe I got beat up by a bunch of girls.
535,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Sorry ladies, didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson. I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?"
536,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,"Well, you're in the right place. Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar."
537,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"It's all right. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception."
538,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.
539,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village."
540,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,"Wow! Best warrior, huh? In your whole village? Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration."
541,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Oh ... Well ... I mean ... I ...
542,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,"Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?"
543,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. All right, you stand over there. Now, this may be a little tough, but try to block me."
544,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Aw! Heh heh ... Good. Of course, I was going easy on you."
545,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,Of course.
546,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Let's see if you can handle ''this''!
547,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,That does it!
548,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,Anything else you want to teach us?
549,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"There she is, girls. Me in a past life."
550,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Fangirls,Ooohhh ...
551,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Koko,You were pretty!
552,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Excuse me for a second, ladies."
553,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? It's a little heavy."
554,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Actually, I can't right now."
555,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"What do you mean, ""you can't?"""
556,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!
557,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does ''not'' sound like fun.
558,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Well, neither does carrying your basket."
559,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"It's not ''my'' basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon."
560,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Aangy ...
561,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Just a second, Koko!"
562,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"""Simple monk"", huh? I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head."
563,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're ''jealous.''
564,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.
565,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,That's ridiculous.
566,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"It ''is'' a little ridiculous, but I understand."
567,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Uh ... Hey, Suki."
568,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,Hoping for another dance lesson?
569,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"No ... I ... well, let me explain."
570,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,I would be honored if you would teach me.
571,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was ... wrong.
572,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,And I mean ''all'' of them.
573,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little ... girly.
574,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,"It's a warrior's uniform, you should be proud. The silk threads symbolize the brave blood that flows through our veins. The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior's heart."
575,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Bravery and honor.
576,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Katara, remember how Unagi almost got me yesterday?"
577,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Yeah.
578,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be ''real'' dangerous."
579,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,You're not going to stop me?
580,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Nope. Have fun.
581,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Great.
582,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,I know it's great.
583,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,I'm glad you know.
584,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,I'm glad you're glad.
585,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Good!
586,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Fine!
587,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,You're not going to master it in one day. Even I'm not that good.
588,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,I think I'm starting to get it.
589,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Tah!
590,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,It's not about strength. Our technique is about using your opponents' force against them. Loosen up. Think of the fan as an extension of your arm. Wait for an opening and then ...
591,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,Hmm ...
592,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,I got you! Admit I got you!
593,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,"Okay, it was a lucky shot. Let's see if you can do it again."
594,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Koko,What's taking so long?
595,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Little Girl,Not that again''. Boring''!
596,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Koko,Where's Unagi? It's getting late.
597,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Where're you going? Don't leave!
598,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Koko,"Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time."
599,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Katara! You showed up!
600,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.
601,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Back there you acted like you didn't care.
602,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,I'm sorry.
603,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.
604,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!"
605,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,On my way!
606,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Hang on, Aang!"
607,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Aang!
608,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Zuko!
609,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,I want the Avatar ''alive.''
610,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Wake up, Aang!"
611,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Katara ... don't ride Unagi. Not fun.
612,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,Not bad.
613,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Oyaji,"Firebenders have landed on our shores! Girls, come quickly!"
614,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"Hey, I'm not a ... oh, whatever!"
615,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,"Come out, Avatar! You can't hide from me forever! Find him."
616,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,I guess training's over.
617,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,"Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you."
618,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Hey! Over here!
619,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,Finally!
620,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,Get inside.
621,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,Look what I brought to this place.
622,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,It's not your fault.
623,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me."
624,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way."
625,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,I'll call Appa.
626,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,There's no time to say goodbye.
627,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,"What about, ""I'm sorry?"""
628,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Suki,For what?
629,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Sokka,I treated you like a girl when I should've treated you like a warrior.
630,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"Appa, yip yip!"
631,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Zuko,Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!
632,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. They're going to be okay, Aang."
633,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Oyaji,"Thank you, Avatar."
634,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Aang,"I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous."
635,1,The Warriors of Kyoshi,Water,1,4,Katara,"Yes, it was."
636,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu! I used to always come here to visit my friend Bumi.
637,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Well let's go, slow pokes. The real fun's inside the city!"
638,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar."
639,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,You need a disguise.
640,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,So what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?
641,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.
642,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"Technically, Aang is 112 years old."
643,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Now let's get to skippin', young whipper-snappers. The big city awaits!"
644,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,You guys are going to love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world.
645,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Cabbage merchant,No! My cabbages!
646,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Gate guard,State your business!
647,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Gate guard,"Settle down, old timer! Just tell me who you are."
648,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,Hi. June Pippinpaddleopsicopolis. Nice to meet you.
649,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Gate guard,''You'' seem like a responsible young lady. See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!
650,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,We will!
651,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Good idea!
652,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Earthbending brings the packages up, and gravity brings them down."
653,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes."
654,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Look around you! What do you see?
655,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Um ... The mail system?
656,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Instead of seeing what they want you to see, you got to open your brain to the possibilities."
657,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,A package-sending system?
658,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Bumi, you're a mad genius!"
659,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"It sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second th-o-o-oughts!"
660,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,I'm on it!
661,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Soldier,"Men, you'll be going off to combat soon. It's important that you be prepared for anything."
662,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"Aang, do something! Use your airbending!"
663,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Yeah! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!
664,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Sorry!
665,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Cabbage merchant,My cabbages! You're gonna pay for this!
666,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Two cabbages please.
667,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Guard,"Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism, traveling under false pretenses, and malicious destruction of cabbages."
668,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Cabbage merchant,Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!
669,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Guard,"Silence! Only the king can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, sire?"
670,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Throw them ... a feast!
671,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts, so I hope you like your chicken with no skin."
672,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Thanks, but I don't eat meat."
673,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,How about you? I bet you like meat.
674,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?"
675,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"So tell me, young bald one, where are you from?"
676,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,I'm from ... Kangaroo Island!
677,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hopping!"
678,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess it's time to hit the hay."
679,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"There's an airbender in our presence, and not just any airbender. The Avatar!"
680,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Now, what do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Pippinpaddleopsicopolis?"
681,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Okay, you caught me. I'm the Avatar. Doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out. No firebenders here. So, good work, everybody! Love each other, respect all life, and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!"
682,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,You can't keep us here! Let us leave!
683,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Lettuce leaf?
684,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Tomorrow, the Avatar will face three deadly challenges. But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber."
685,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Chamberlain,"My liege, do you mean the good chamber or the bad chamber?"
686,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,The newly refurbished chamber.
687,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Chamberlain,"Wait, which one are we talking about?"
688,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing, that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them. Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!"
689,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.
690,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,He did say it was newly refurbished.
691,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,"Nice or not, we're prisoners!"
692,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,We're not sticking around to find out. There's got to be some way out of here.
693,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,The air vents!
694,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,"If you think we're going to fit through there, you're crazier than that king."
695,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"''We'' can't, but Momo can!"
696,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!"
697,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Go on, boy, get Appa!"
698,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,"Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?"
699,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"Well, no point arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang. Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow."
700,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Guard,The king will free them if you complete your challenges.
701,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,I ... guess it's fine.
702,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Excellent! You passed the first test.
703,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Really?
704,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Well, not one of the deadly tests. The real challenges are much more, uh, challenging."
705,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,I don't have time for your crazy games! Give me my friends back! We're leaving!
706,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Oh, I thought you might refuse, so I will give your friends some special souvenirs."
707,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,Ah! It's already creeping!
708,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry. Ooh, there it is! Would you mind fetching it for me?"
709,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Ooh, climbing the ladder. No one's thought of ''that'' before."
710,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,That's right. Keep diving head in. I'm sure it'll work eventually.
711,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,There! Enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back ''now''!
712,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Ah, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I've lost my pet, Flopsie."
713,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Okay! Found him!
714,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Bring him to me. Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsie!
715,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Come here, Flopsie. Huh?"
716,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Flopsie, wait! Flopsie! Flopsie!"
717,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Wait a minute. Flopsie?
718,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Flopsie!
719,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Oh, that's a good boy. Yes, who has a soft belly?"
720,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Guys, are you okay?"
721,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"Other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body, doing great!"
722,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Oh, yes."
723,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Come on! I'm ready for the next challenge.
724,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Your final test is a duel. And as a special treat, you may choose your opponent."
725,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Point and choose.
726,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"So ... you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?"
727,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Choose wisely!
728,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,I ... choose ... you.
729,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Wrong choice!
730,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"You thought I was a frail old man, but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see."
731,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?
732,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,There are no take-backsies in my kingdom. You might need this.
733,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I hoped the Avatar would be less predictable.
734,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later you'll have to strike back!
735,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,You'll have to be a little more creative than that!
736,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here. Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?
737,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,How are you going to get me from way over there?
738,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart. You've passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question."
739,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.
740,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Oh, but what's the point of tests if you don't learn anything?"
741,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,"Oh, come on!"
742,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. What ... is my name? From the looks of your friends I'd say you only have a few minutes.
743,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,How am I supposed to know his name?
744,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,Think about the challenges. Maybe it's some kind of riddle.
745,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,I got it!
746,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,Yeah?
747,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,"He's an earthbender, right? Rocky. You know, because of all the rocks."
748,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"We're going to keep trying, but that is a good back-up."
749,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Okay. So back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall, I saved his pet, and I had a duel."
750,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,And what did you learn?
751,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Well, everything was different than I expected."
752,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,And?
753,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Well, they weren't straight forward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name."
754,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. Bumi, you're a mad genius."
755,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Oh Aang, it's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally."
756,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,"Uh, over here!"
757,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,Little help?
758,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,Jennamite is made of rock candy. Delicious!
759,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Katara,So this crazy king is your old friend Bumi?
760,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"Who are you calling old? Okay, I'm old."
761,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Sokka,Why did you do all of this instead of just telling Aang who you were?
762,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Bumi,"First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people. But I do have a reason. Aang, you have a difficult task ahead. The world has changed in the hundred years that you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord. And when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius. And it looks like you're in good hands. You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation. And you'll need Momo, too."
763,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Aang,"Thank you for your wisdom, but before we leave, I have a challenge for you."
764,1,The King of Omashu,Water,1,5,Cabbage merchant,My cabbages!
765,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,"Great, you're back!"
766,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,What's for dinner?
767,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Seriously ... what else you got?
768,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,What was that?
769,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,It's coming from over there!
770,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,Shouldn't we run ''away'' from huge booms? Not toward them?
771,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,An earthbender!
772,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,Let's go meet him!
773,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously."
774,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Hello there! I'm Katara! What's your name?
775,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I just wanted to say hi.
776,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,Hey! That guy's gotta be running somewhere. Maybe we're near a village? And I bet that village has a market!
777,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Which means no nuts for dinner!
778,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! Yeah, I hate 'em too."
779,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,Great hat! I'll trade you some nuts for it.
780,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Hey ...
781,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"Hi, Mom."
782,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru's mother,"Where have you been, Haru? You're late! Get started on your chores."
783,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Hey. You're that kid. Why did you run away before?
784,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid."
785,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,"No, she doesn't. We saw you earthbending."
786,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru's mother,They saw you doing what?!
787,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"They're crazy, Mom! I mean, look at how they're dressed."
788,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru's mother,You ''know'' how dangerous that is! You know what would happen if ''they'' caught you earthbending!
789,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tax collector,Open up!
790,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,Fire Nation! Act natural!
791,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tax collector,"The tax just doubled. And we wouldn't want an accident, would we? Fire is sometimes so hard to control."
792,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tax collector,You can keep the copper ones.
793,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?
794,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru's mother,Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.
795,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,They're thugs. They steal from us. And everyone here's too much of a coward to do anything about it.
796,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru's mother,"Quiet, Haru! Don't talk like that."
797,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"But, Haru's an earthbender? He can help!"
798,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru's mother,Earthbending is forbidden. It's caused nothing but misery for this village! He must never use his abilities.
799,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,How can you say that? Haru has a gift! Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.
800,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru's mother,You don't understand.
801,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?
802,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru's mother,They could take Haru away! Like they took his father.
803,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,My mom said you can sleep here tonight. But you should leave in the morning.
804,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.
805,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.
806,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"That's okay. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store? It reminded me of him."
807,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Thanks.
808,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one. But they fought back anyway."
809,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,He sounds like a great man.
810,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"After the attack, they rounded up my father and every other earthbender, and took them away. We haven't seen them since."
811,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,So that's why you hide your earthbending.
812,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,Yeah. Problem is ... the only way I can feel close to my father now is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.
813,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.
814,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,It's beautiful.
815,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.
816,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"It's not enough, is it?"
817,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,No.
818,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Old man,"Help, help!"
819,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,The mine!
820,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Old man,Help me!
821,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Ugh! It's not working! We have to get help!
822,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"There's no time, pull harder!"
823,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Haru. There's a way ''you'' can help him.
824,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,I ''can't.''
825,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"Please, there's no one around to see you. It's the only way!"
826,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Haru! You did it!
827,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.
828,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,You must have ''really'' inspired him.
829,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I guess so.
830,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"Everyone should get some sleep, we're leaving at dawn."
831,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Dawn?! Can't we sleep in for once?
832,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight."
833,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.
834,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,''Goodnight!''
835,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Old man,That's him! That's the earthbender!
836,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,What?
837,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending!
838,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"Slow down, Katara. When did this happen?"
839,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.
840,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone."
841,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.
842,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,And ... why would they do that?
843,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.
844,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and ''ta-da!'' Fake earthbending."
845,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Aang? Did you get all that?
846,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,Do you remember your cue?
847,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"By ''this,'' do you mean intentionally being captured by a group of ruthless firebenders?"
848,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,Exactly! That's fun stuff!
849,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,Here they come! Get in your places!
850,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"Get out of my way, pipsqueak!"
851,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"How ''dare'' you call me pipsqueak, you giant-eared cretin!"
852,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,What did you call me?
853,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things! Do herds of animals use them for shade?!
854,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"You better back off! Seriously, back off."
855,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large ''your'' ears are!
856,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,That's it! You're going down!
857,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"I'll show ''you'' who's boss! Earthbending style! I said, ''earthbending style''!"
858,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"No, you idiot, it's the girl!"
859,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Guard,Oh. Of course.
860,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,I'll hold her. You've got twelve hours to find Haru. We'll be right behind you.
861,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"Momo, ''you'' have some big ears!"
862,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"She'll be fine, Aang. Katara knows what she's doing."
863,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,"Earthbenders. It is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard. I am your warden. I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, but as honored guests. And I hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host. You will succeed here, if you simply abide-"
864,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,What kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him?! Take him below! One week in solitary will improve his manners. Simply treat me with the courtesy that I give you-
865,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,And we'll get along ''famously.''
866,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,"You will notice, earthbenders, that this rig is made entirely of metal. You are miles away from any rock or earth. So, if you have any illusions about employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people ... forget them. It is impossible. Good day."
867,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,Katara?
868,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,Haru!
869,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,What are you doing here?
870,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.
871,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"So, you got yourself arrested?"
872,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,It was the only way to find you.
873,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"You've got guts, Katara. I'll give you that. Come on. There's someone I want you to meet."
874,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"Katara. This is my father, Tyro. Dad. This is Katara."
875,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,It's an honor to meet you.
876,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,"Have some dinner, Katara. It's not as bad as it looks. It's still pretty bad though."
877,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Prisoner,Tyro. The prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.
878,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,"I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather."
879,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?"
880,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,Excuse me?
881,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny, sabotage?"
882,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,The plan? The plan is to survive. Wait out this war. Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.
883,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up!
884,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,"Katara, I admire your courage. And I envy your youth. But people's lives are at stake here. The warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless."
885,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,We'll see about that.
886,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your ''courage''. And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!"
887,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I can't.
888,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,We don't have much time. There are guards everywhere. Get on!
889,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,"Katara, what's wrong?"
890,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I'm not leaving. I'm not giving up on these people.
891,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,What do you mean you're not leaving?
892,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,We can't abandon these people! There has to be a way to help them.
893,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,"Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka?"
894,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"I say you're both crazy! Last chance! We need to leave, now!"
895,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,No!
896,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"I hate when you get like this. Come on, we better hide."
897,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,Go hide.
898,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Captain,Look!
899,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,Tell me exactly what you saw.
900,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Captain,"Well, sir, it looked like a flying bison."
901,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,What?
902,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Guard,"It was a giant flying buffalo, sir. With an empty saddle."
903,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,Which was it? A buffalo or a bison?
904,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Captain,"Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point, is it, sir?"
905,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,"I'll decide what the point is, fool!"
906,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,You! Wake up the captain. Search the entire rig!
907,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Guard,"Uh, sir."
908,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,What?
909,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Guard,"That was ... the captain you just threw overboard, so ..."
910,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,Then wake up someone I ''haven't'' thrown overboard and search the rig! There's something going on here and I don't like it.
911,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,We don't have much time. What are we gonna do?
912,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,I wish I knew how to make a hurricane!
913,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,The warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!
914,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?
915,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,I'm just tossing ideas around.
916,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"I tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but, it didn't work! If there was just a way to help them help themselves."
917,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock. Something they can bend."
918,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,But this entire place is made of metal!
919,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Aang,"No, it's not. Look at the smoke! I bet they're burning coal. In other words, ''earth.''"
920,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,It's almost dawn. We're running out of time! You sure this is gonna work?
921,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,"It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo. And the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go, right back here."
922,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Guard,There's the intruder!
923,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Sokka,Stay back! I'm warning you!
924,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,"Katara, stop! You can't win this fight!"
925,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,"Listen to him well, child. You're one mistake away from dying where you stand."
926,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"Here's your chance, earthbenders! Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!"
927,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,"Foolish girl. You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these blank, hopeless faces. Their spirits were broken a long time ago. Oh, but you still believe in them. How sweet. They're a waste of your energy little girl. You ''failed.''"
928,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,Show no mercy!
929,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,"For the Earth Kingdom, attack!"
930,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,Get to the ships! We'll hold them off!
931,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,Do not let them escape!
932,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Warden,"No, please! I can't swim!"
933,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,Don't worry. I hear cowards float.
934,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,I want to thank you for saving me. For saving us.
935,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,All it took was a little coal.
936,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"It wasn't the coal, Katara. It was you."
937,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,"Thank you for helping me find my courage, Katara of the Water Tribe. My family and everyone here owes you much."
938,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,"So, I guess you're going home now."
939,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Tyro,Yes. To take back my village. To take back all of our villages! The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land!
940,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,Come with us.
941,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.
942,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Haru,"That's him, isn't it? The Avatar. Katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me. I never thought I'd see him again. I only wish there was some way ..."
943,1,Imprisoned,Water,1,6,Katara,I know. My mother's necklace! It's gone!
944,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Turns out, clouds are made of water."
945,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"Hey, what is that?"
946,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,It's like a scar ...
947,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,Listen. It's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.
948,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,Aang? Are you okay?
949,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,Shhh!
950,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,What? I'm not allowed to be angry?
951,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you."
952,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job."
953,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,That's why we're going to the North Pole. To find you a teacher.
954,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,Yeah. A waterbending teacher. But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.
955,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,I don't know.
956,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh!
957,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,Over here!
958,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,Uncle? We need to move on. We're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him.
959,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,"You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?"
960,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!
961,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself.
962,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,Enough! We need to leave now. Get out of the water!
963,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,Very well!
964,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,"On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes? But be back at the ship in a half-hour or I'm leaving without you!"
965,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"Hey, Aang! You ready to be cheered up?"
966,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"No. Ow! Hey, how is that cheering me up?"
967,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,"Cheered me up. Ow. Yeah, I probably deserved that."
968,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back."
969,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Thanks, Katara."
970,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,"Hey, who are you?"
971,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Senlin Village leader,"So, the rumors of your return are true! It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence."
972,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,Nice to meet you too! So ... is there something I can help you with?
973,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Senlin Village leader,I'm not sure ...
974,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,Why is it attacking you?
975,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Senlin Village leader,"We do not know, but each of the last three nights, he has abducted one of our own. We are especially fearful because the winter solstice draws near."
976,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,What happens then?
977,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Senlin Village leader,"Hei Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here, there's no telling what will happen."
978,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"So, what do you want me to do, exactly?"
979,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,Right ... that's me.
980,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second? Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this."
981,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!"
982,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,So ... can you help these people?
983,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just ... come to me."
984,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"I think you can do it, Aang."
985,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,Yeah. We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster.
986,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,"Who's there? A meadow vole! I should have known. You startled me, little one. It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap."
987,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Soldier,He's a Fire Nation soldier.
988,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,"He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West. The once-great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner."
989,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Hello, Spirit? Can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm here to try to help stuff."
990,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.
991,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,He still shouldn't have to face this alone.
992,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"The sun has set. Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace. Okay ... well ... I guess that's settled, then."
993,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"My name's Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help. Hey, wait up! Uhhh ..."
994,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Senlin Village leader,The Avatar's methods are ... unusual.
995,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him.
996,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka."
997,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? I'm trying to do my job as spirit bridge! Excuse me, would you please turn around? I command you to turn around now!"
998,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,That's it. He needs help.
999,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"Sokka, wait!"
1000,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Senlin Village leader,It's not safe!
1001,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,"Hei Bai, over here!"
1002,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Sokka, go back!"
1003,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,"We'll fight him together, Aang."
1004,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,Sokka!
1005,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,"Uncle! Uncle, where are you?"
1006,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Fire Nation Soldier,"Sir, maybe he thought you left without him."
1007,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,Something's not right here. That pile of rocks.
1008,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Fire Nation Soldier,"It looks like there's been a landslide, sir."
1009,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!
1010,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,Aang! Over here! Help!
1011,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Hang on, Sokka!"
1012,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,Sokka! I failed.
1013,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,Where are you taking me?
1014,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,We're taking you to face justice.
1015,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,"Right, but where, specifically?"
1016,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,"A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you."
1017,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,"Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se."
1018,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,"It was greater than you were, apparently."
1019,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,"I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. And I'm still tired."
1020,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,I know.
1021,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,Everything's going to be okay ...
1022,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Katara? Katara, I lost him."
1023,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"What? No, I'm right here! I'm in the Spirit World!"
1024,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,"Yeah, that's Uncle Iroh."
1025,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"I'll figure this out, Katara. I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is ... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem. Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here! But, I guess you can't see me either."
1026,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"It's okay, Appa, don't worry. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat."
1027,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"What am I supposed to do? Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you? Sokka? That's definitely not Sokka. What? I can't airbend in the Spirit World. You don't know where Sokka is, do you? You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me! I need to save my friend and I don't know how! Is there some way for me to talk to Roku? I'll be back, Katara. Take me to Roku!"
1028,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,What's the problem?
1029,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,"Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose."
1030,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,Too loose?
1031,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,That's right. The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.
1032,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,"Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's handcuffs."
1033,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Hey, what are you doing? I don't understand, this is just a statue of Roku. Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him? It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice! So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku? But I can't wait that long! I need to save Sokka now!"
1034,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Soldier,"He's too dangerous, Captain! We just can't just carry him to the Capital! We have to do something now!"
1035,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely.
1036,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"It's no use, Appa. I don't seem them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait."
1037,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,The Avatar!
1038,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,Whoa!
1039,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,You're back! Where's Sokka?
1040,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,I'm not sure ...
1041,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,These dangerous hands must be crushed.
1042,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,"Excellent form, Prince Zuko."
1043,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,You taught me well.
1044,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Earthbender captain,Surrender yourselves. It's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.
1045,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Iroh,"Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched."
1046,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Zuko,Now would you please put on some clothes?
1047,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"Aang, what are you doing?! Run!"
1048,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"You're the spirit of this forest! Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back."
1049,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,Sokka!
1050,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,What happened?
1051,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,You were trapped in the Spirit World for 24 hours! How are you feeling?
1052,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,Like I seriously need to use the bathroom.
1053,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Senlin Village leader,"Thank you, Avatar. If only there were a way to repay you for what you've done."
1054,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,"You could give us some supplies, and some money."
1055,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,Sokka!
1056,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,What? We need stuff.
1057,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Senlin Village leader,It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.
1058,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,"I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do, all on your own."
1059,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Actually, I did have a little help and there's something else."
1060,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,What is it?
1061,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,I need to talk to Roku and I think I found a way to contact his spirit.
1062,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,That's great!
1063,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Sokka,"Creepy, but great."
1064,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him."
1065,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Katara,But the solstice is tomorrow!
1066,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 1: The Spirit World",Water,1,7,Aang,"Yeah, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation."
1067,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.
1068,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means! I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice. That's today!
1069,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,"We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang."
1070,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,"At least, not without your friends. We got your back. Ew!"
1071,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Senlin Village leader,It's a long journey to the Crescent Island. You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before sundown. Good luck.
1072,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Thank you for your-
1073,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Senlin Village leader,Go!
1074,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,Having trouble sleeping? Seen the Avatar lately?
1075,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,"Come on boy, we've got a long way to go. Faster!"
1076,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Iroh,"Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish!"
1077,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,"I have no choice, Uncle."
1078,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Iroh,Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord ''banished you''? What if you're caught?
1079,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,I'm chasing the Avatar! My father will understand why I am returning home!
1080,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Iroh,You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type!
1081,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,There they are. Helmsman! Full steam ahead!
1082,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,Aang. We've got trouble!
1083,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,"Yeah! And it's gaining, fast!"
1084,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Iroh,"Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?"
1085,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,On my mark! Fire!
1086,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,Fireball!
1087,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,I'm on it!
1088,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,"We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us!"
1089,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,Can't you make Appa go any faster?
1090,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Yeah. But there's just one little problem.
1091,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,A blockade.
1092,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Iroh,Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.
1093,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,"If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade! It's the ''only'' way."
1094,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,There's no time!
1095,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,This is exactly why I didn't want you to come! It's too dangerous!
1096,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,And that's ''exactly'' why we're here.
1097,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,Let's run this blockade!
1098,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,"Appa, yip-yip!"
1099,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,He's not turning around!
1100,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Iroh,"Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar."
1101,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,"I'm sorry, Uncle. Run the blockade!"
1102,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,The Avatar. And the banished prince. This must be my lucky day.
1103,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Captain,Commander Zhao. What are your orders?
1104,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,"Shoot the bison down, captain."
1105,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Captain,"But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, sir! One of our own! What if it's hit?"
1106,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,So be it. It belongs to a traitor. Ignite. Launch!
1107,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,"Appa, are you okay?"
1108,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Engineer,Prince Zuko! The engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!
1109,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,Do ''not'' stop this ship.
1110,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,Launch!
1111,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Sokka!
1112,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,Ready ...
1113,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,Fire!
1114,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,We made it!
1115,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,We got into the Fire Nation. Great.
1116,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Captain,"Where do you think the Avatar is headed, sir?"
1117,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,I'm not sure. But I bet a certain banished prince will know.
1118,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Iroh,We're on a collision course!
1119,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,We can make it!
1120,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Captain,"The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, sir."
1121,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,"Wait! Cut the engines, and let them pass."
1122,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Captain,Sir?
1123,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,There it is! The island where Roku's dragon took me.
1124,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,You did it buddy. Nice flying.
1125,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,"Aww, you must be tired."
1126,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,No! I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders!
1127,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,I was talking to Appa.
1128,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,Well ... I was talking to Momo.
1129,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,I don't see any guards.
1130,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.
1131,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,It's almost sundown. We better hurry!
1132,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,Wait. I think I heard something.
1133,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.
1134,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Great! I am the Avatar!
1135,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,We know.
1136,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,I'll hold them off. Run!
1137,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,"If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become! Split up and find him."
1138,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,Do you know where you're going?
1139,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Nope! Wrong way!
1140,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,Come back!
1141,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,I don't want to fight you! I am a friend.
1142,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,Firebenders aren't our friends!
1143,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"I know why you're here, Avatar."
1144,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,You do?
1145,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,Yes. You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.
1146,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,How?
1147,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,This way.
1148,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,Find him.
1149,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,Time is running out! Quickly!
1150,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,"What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?"
1151,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Iroh,Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar.
1152,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,"If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do."
1153,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.
1154,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Did you know Avatar Roku?
1155,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this Fire Temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.
1156,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Is that how you knew I was coming?
1157,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,"That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!"
1158,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world."
1159,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,"If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?"
1160,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"Things have changed. In the past, the sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came."
1161,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,They were waiting for me.
1162,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late!
1163,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozin began the War, my grandfather and the other sages were forced to follow him. I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other sages."
1164,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Thank you for helping me.
1165,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary. Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him."
1166,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,No!
1167,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,"Shyu, what's wrong?"
1168,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"The sanctuary doors, they're closed!"
1169,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?
1170,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise, the sages must open this door together, with five simultaneous fire blasts."
1171,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,"Five fire blasts, huh? I think I can help you out."
1172,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,"Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover."
1173,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,"This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, ta-da! Fake firebending!"
1174,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,"You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka."
1175,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,This might actually work.
1176,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"The sages will hear the explosion, so as soon as they go off, you rush in!"
1177,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,It's almost sunset. Are you ready?
1178,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Definitely.
1179,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,They're still locked!
1180,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,It didn't work.
1181,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,"Why, won't, it, open?!"
1182,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,Aang! Stop! There's nothing else we can do ...
1183,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.
1184,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.
1185,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,"Sokka, you're a genius!"
1186,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work.
1187,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,Come on Aang. Let her dream.
1188,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,You're right. Sokka's plan ''didn't'' work. But it ''looks'' like it did.
1189,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years?
1190,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,Come quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!
1191,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,How did he get in?
1192,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,I don't know. But look at the scorch marks! And down there!
1193,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,"He's inside! Open the doors, immediately! Before he contacts Avatar Roku!"
1194,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,It's the Avatar's lemur. He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!
1195,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,"Now, Aang!"
1196,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,Aang! Now's your chance!
1197,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,The Avatar's coming with me! Close the doors! Quickly!
1198,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,Go!
1199,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,He made it!
1200,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?
1201,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!
1202,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.
1203,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,"Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!"
1204,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,It's good to see you Aang. What took you so long?
1205,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,Why did you help the Avatar?
1206,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,Because it was once the sages' duty. It is still our duty.
1207,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,"What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand, when you explain why you betrayed him."
1208,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,Commander Zhao.
1209,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,"And Prince Zuko. It was a noble effort, but your little smokescreen didn't work. Two traitors in one day, the Fire Lord ''will'' be pleased."
1210,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zuko,"You're too late, Zhao! The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed."
1211,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,"No matter. Sooner or later, he has to come out."
1212,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,"I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the Spirit World, I sent my dragon to find you."
1213,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Is it about that vision? The one of the comet?
1214,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,Yes.
1215,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,What does it mean?
1216,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,"One hundred years ago, Fire Lord Sozin used that comet to begin the War. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power, and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations."
1217,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,So the comet made them stronger?
1218,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.
1219,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War ''now''?
1220,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,"Listen carefully. Sozin's Comet will return by the end of this summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all. If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang. You ''must'' defeat the Fire Lord, before the comet arrives."
1221,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,But I haven't even started learning waterbending! Not to mention earth and fire!
1222,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,"Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end."
1223,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,"When those doors open, unleash all your firepower!"
1224,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,How's Aang gonna make it out of this?
1225,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,How are ''we'' gonna make it out of this?
1226,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?
1227,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,"I know you can do it Aang. For you have done it before. The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways, for now."
1228,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?
1229,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Roku,"I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way. A great danger awaits you at the temple. I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready."
1230,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,I'm ready.
1231,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,Ready ...
1232,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,No! Aang!
1233,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,Fire!
1234,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,Avatar Roku ...
1235,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Shyu,Avatar Roku is going to destroy the temple! We ''have'' to get out of here!
1236,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,''Not'' without Aang!
1237,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Sokka,We got your back.
1238,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Aang,Thanks. Where's Shyu?
1239,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Katara,I don't know.
1240,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,"No ''Prince'', no ''Avatar''! Apparently, the only thing I do have is five ''traitors!''"
1241,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Great Fire Sage,But Commander! Only Shyu helped the Avatar.
1242,1,"Winter Solstice, Part 2: Avatar Roku",Water,1,8,Zhao,"Save your stories for the Fire Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you are all ''guilty''! Take them to the prison hold!"
1243,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Would you sit down? If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off. What's bugging you anyway?"
1244,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.
1245,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Well, let's see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer."
1246,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do?
1247,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Calm down, it's going to be okay. If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know."
1248,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,You'd do that?
1249,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,We'll need to find a good source of water first.
1250,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Nice puddle.
1251,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Yeah! Don't start without me, boy!"
1252,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,Remember the reason we're here.
1253,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Oh right. Time to practice waterbending.
1254,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Great. So what am I supposed to do?
1255,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes.
1256,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet?"
1257,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Okay.
1258,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,What is the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!
1259,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,"Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko."
1260,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,Is it something to do with the Avatar?
1261,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,"Even more urgent. It seems, I- -I have lost my lotus tile."
1262,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,Lotus tile?
1263,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,"For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ."
1264,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?
1265,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,"See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life. I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew."
1266,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Yeah, don't get too happy. You've got to do ''me'' next."
1267,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect. So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away. Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right."
1268,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Like this?
1269,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Hey, I'm bending it already!"
1270,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It took me two months to learn that move."
1271,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher."
1272,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,Thanks.
1273,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"So, what's next?"
1274,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water. It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if- Nice work. Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary."
1275,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Sorry. Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em coming!"
1276,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave."
1277,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"So, like this?"
1278,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Aang?!
1279,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else do you got?
1280,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,That's enough practicing for today.
1281,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Yeah, I'll say! You just ""practiced"" our supplies down the river."
1282,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Uh, sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff."
1283,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender.
1284,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.
1285,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!"
1286,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,It doesn't even work. See? Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.
1287,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on."
1288,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Oh,"Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation! So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here! Don't be shy, come on by! Oh! You there, I can see from your clothing that you're world-traveling types. Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?"
1289,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Sure! What are curios?
1290,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Oh,I'm not entirely sure. But we got 'em!
1291,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Huh?
1292,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur. That beast would fetch me a hefty sum if you'd be interested in bartering.
1293,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Momo's not for sale.
1294,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Look at this, Aang. It's a waterbending scroll! Check out these crazy moves."
1295,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Where did you get a waterbending scroll?
1296,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,"Let's just say I got it up North, at a most reasonable price, free."
1297,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Wait a minute ... Sea loving traders, with suspiciously acquired merchandise, and pet reptile birds? You guys are pirates!"
1298,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Oh,"We prefer to think of ourselves as ""high risk traders."""
1299,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"So, how much for the, uh, ''traded'' scroll?"
1300,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,"I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom. Unless of course, you kids have two hundred gold pieces on you right now."
1301,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"I know how to deal with these guys, Katara. Pirates love to haggle. Watch and learn. Let's say to the price of, one copper piece!"
1302,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,The price is two hundred gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare.
1303,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Okay, two copper pieces!"
1304,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,"It's not as amusing the second time, boy!"
1305,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Aang, can we get out of here? I feel like we're getting weird looks."
1306,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Aye, we be casting off now!"
1307,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"What was that all about, Katara?"
1308,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Yeah, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection."
1309,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.
1310,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Oh,Hey you! Get back here!
1311,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Well, well. Look who's come to their senses. Told you the haggling would pay off."
1312,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us.
1313,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Oh,This way. Let's cut 'em off!
1314,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Whoa!
1315,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Cabbage merchant,My cabbages! This place is worse than Omashu!
1316,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate,I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives!
1317,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Oh,"Now, who gets to taste the steel of my blade first?"
1318,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,No thanks. Grab on tight!
1319,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,Aang! I thought we were running ''away'' from the pirates!
1320,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Just hang on!
1321,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible."
1322,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,I know. That's why I took this.
1323,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,No way!
1324,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,Isn't it great?
1325,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,No wonder they were trying to hack us up! You stole their waterbending scroll!
1326,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,I prefer to think of it as high risk trading.
1327,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Good one, Katara."
1328,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Sokka, where do you think ''they'' got it? They stole it from a waterbender!"
1329,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes."
1330,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,These are ''real'' waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending!
1331,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Whatever.
1332,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Well, what's done is done. We have it, we might as well learn from it."
1333,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.
1334,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time ''for everyone''!
1335,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,"Quite the contrary. I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!"
1336,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,You bought a tsungi horn?
1337,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,"For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds. Oh, this place looks promising! Oh, that is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?"
1338,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Oh,We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with.
1339,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?"
1340,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours. Here, hold it open for me. The single water whip. Looks doable. Ow!"
1341,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Ha, ha, ha!"
1342,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,What's so funny?
1343,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip. Ugh, why can't I get this stupid move?"
1344,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Will you please shut your air hole? Believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes! Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted! What? Oh my gosh, Aang, I am so sorry, I don't know what came over me. But you know what, it won't happen again. Here, this is yours. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore."
1345,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,It's okay Katara.
1346,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,What about Momo? He's the real victim here.
1347,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"I'm sorry, Momo."
1348,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,No more apologies!
1349,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?
1350,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?"
1351,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,Mm-hm.
1352,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,Then they'll be on the water.
1353,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Shhh, Momo! Go back to sleep. Shh! Ugh, ugh, ugh! Shoot! Come on water, work with me here! Okay, what if I just, ow! Stupid scroll! Okay Katara, shift your weight through the stances. No! Let go of me!"
1354,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,I'll save you from the pirates.
1355,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.
1356,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,Go jump in the river!
1357,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"Try to understand. I need to capture him to restore something I've lost, my honor. Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost."
1358,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,My mother's necklace! How did you get that?
1359,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. ''Tell me'' where he is."
1360,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,No!
1361,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,Enough of this necklace garbage! You promised a scroll!
1362,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"I wonder how much this is worth ... A lot, apparently. Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back, and everyone goes home happy. Search the woods for the boy and meet back here!"
1363,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,Fine.
1364,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Huh? Where did she go? I don't believe it.
1365,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,What's wrong?
1366,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing. It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep-
1367,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate,"I got him, come on!"
1368,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap? Ah!"
1369,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,Nice work.
1370,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Aang, this is all ''my'' fault."
1371,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"No Katara, it isn't."
1372,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,"Yeah, it kind of is."
1373,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,Give me the boy.
1374,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,''You'' give ''us'' the scroll.
1375,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,You're really gonna hand over ''the Avatar'' for a stupid piece of parchment?
1376,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"Don't listen to him, he's trying to turn us against each other!"
1377,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,Your friend is the Avatar?
1378,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll."
1379,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"Shut your mouth, you Water Tribe peasant!"
1380,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Yeah, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth."
1381,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense. Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life.
1382,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,You'll regret breaking a deal with me.
1383,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples."
1384,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Aang, are you there?"
1385,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,I'm over here! Follow my voice!
1386,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Where? I can't find you!
1387,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"I'm right here! Uh, never mind! I'll find you! Run! Katara, you're okay!"
1388,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here.
1389,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,We'd need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.
1390,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"A team of rhinos, or two waterbenders."
1391,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,Everybody in!
1392,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?
1393,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!"
1394,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,It's no proverb!
1395,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Pirate captain,Bleeding hog monkeys!
1396,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,Hey! That's ''my'' boat!
1397,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,Maybe it should be a proverb ...
1398,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,"C'mon, Uncle!"
1399,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Sokka, can't you make it go any faster?"
1400,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the Water Tribe!
1401,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Hey, you did the water whip!"
1402,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,I couldn't have done it without your help.
1403,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Would you two quit congratulating each other and help me out?
1404,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Oh,That's good ...
1405,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Aang, look!"
1406,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,Oh no ...
1407,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Have you lost your mind? This is no time for flute practice!
1408,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water! It's working, it's slowing down! We're doing it!"
1409,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,But we have another problem.
1410,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Together,Jump!
1411,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,I knew a bison whistle would come in handy! Thanks Appa.
1412,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"Yeah, we owe you one."
1413,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Zuko,My boat!
1414,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Iroh,"Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!"
1415,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Aang, I still owe you an apology. You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger, I'm sorry."
1416,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,That's okay Katara.
1417,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,"Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway?"
1418,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,Is that really how you feel?
1419,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,The scroll!
1420,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Sokka,"First, what did you learn?"
1421,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Katara,Stealing is wrong. Unless it's from pirates.
1422,1,The Waterbending Scroll,Water,1,9,Aang,"Good one, Katara."
1423,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?"
1424,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Right, got it ..."
1425,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp ''on top'' of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on?"
1426,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket."
1427,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,But what if it does rain?
1428,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,What if it doesn't? Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing.
1429,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,You're infuriating!
1430,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry."
1431,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Well, if you don't like my firewood-"
1432,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job-"
1433,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?"
1434,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs."
1435,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the Tents!"
1436,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?"
1437,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,Sounds good.
1438,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,Whatever.
1439,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"You see that? Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar. Come on, Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs."
1440,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"There it is, guys, The Great Divide."
1441,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Wow, I could just stare at it forever."
1442,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Okay, I've seen enough."
1443,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,How can you not be fascinated Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.
1444,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.
1445,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,"If you're looking for the canyon guide, I was here first!"
1446,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Ooh, canyon guide? Sounds informative."
1447,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,"Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender, and the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help, and he's taking ''my'' tribe across next."
1448,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Calm down, we know you're next."
1449,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,You wouldn't be so calm if the Fire Nation destroyed ''your'' home and forced ''you'' to flee! My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se.
1450,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,You're a refugee!
1451,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,"Huh, tell me something I don't know."
1452,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,Is that your tribe?
1453,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,"It most certainly is not! That's the Zhang tribe, a bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years. Hey, Zhangs! I'm saving a spot for my tribe so don't even think about stealing it!"
1454,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their camp site?
1455,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,"Yes, but they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot."
1456,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,I didn't know the canyon guide took reservations.
1457,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,"Ha, of course you didn't! That's the ignorance I'd expect from ''a messy Zhang.'' So unorganized and ill-prepared for a journey."
1458,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon?"
1459,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Uh, one of them, I think."
1460,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,"I was here first, my party's on their way."
1461,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,I can't guide people who aren't here.
1462,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,Guess you guys will have to make the trip tomorrow.
1463,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,"Wait, here they come!"
1464,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,You're not seriously gonna cave into these spoiled Gan Jins? I mean we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter.
1465,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,I ... uh ... well ...
1466,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin tribesman,We've got old people who are weary from traveling.
1467,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,Sick people get priority over old people.
1468,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.
1469,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"If you Gan Jins weren't so ''clean'', you wouldn't live to be so ''old.''"
1470,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Well Aang, ready to put your peace-making skills to the test?"
1471,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding for a hundred years."
1472,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Everybody listen up! This is the Avatar, and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy."
1473,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Uh, you could ''share'' the earthbender and travel together?"
1474,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves!
1475,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,We wouldn't travel with those pompous fools anyway!
1476,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"All right here's the deal, you're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across! Does that seem fair?"
1477,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Sorry, Appa, you'll have to do this on your own."
1478,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?"
1479,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been?"
1480,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job."
1481,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isn't it?
1482,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"Okay, now comes the bad news. No food allowed in the canyon, it attracts ''dangerous'' predators."
1483,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin Leader,No food?! This is ridiculous.
1484,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"Oh, you babies can go a day without food? Would you rather be hungry, or dead? Now, we're heading down in ten minutes. All food better be in your gut or in the garbage!"
1485,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Appa's going to take good care of you 'till we get there. See you on the other side, buddy! Yip yip!"
1486,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,Nice bending!
1487,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information. Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed. Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by earth spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice."
1488,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"He he he, guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices."
1489,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"Okay, everyone stand clear of the wall."
1490,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,Why'd you do that?
1491,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? Gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now."
1492,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"We gotta help him! Okay, now we gotta help ''me''!"
1493,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,What was that?
1494,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,Canyon crawler. And there's sure to be more!
1495,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Your arms, they're broken!"
1496,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words-"
1497,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,We're trapped in this canyon.
1498,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers.
1499,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,It's the Zhangs! They took food down here even after the canyon guide told them not to.
1500,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"What? If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day, it's you pampered Gan Jins!"
1501,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,I hope you're happy. We're stuck in this canyon with no way out.
1502,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"Why don't you thank yourself, food hider?"
1503,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Look, sticking together is the only way to-"
1504,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,I'm not walking another step with the likes of them!
1505,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,Now there's something we can agree on.
1506,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,Any ideas?
1507,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,No bendng ... we need to get out of this canyon ... I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!
1508,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,See! We're going to become part of the food chain because of you!
1509,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"Sure, unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!"
1510,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,Gladly.
1511,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen. We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines. Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much."
1512,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?"
1513,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,What for? Its the dry season.
1514,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,Exactly!
1515,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket."
1516,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Finally, someone gets it!"
1517,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,You really think it'll rain?
1518,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,"No, but you can never be too careful, right?"
1519,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,"Would you care for some bread, Katara?"
1520,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,So it was you guys who had food!
1521,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,"Oh come now, you really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?"
1522,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it. So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much?"
1523,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,"You seem like a smart girl Katara, I bet you would enjoy hearing some history. The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual. But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the ground, and stole our sacred orb. Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang."
1524,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,Care for some meat?
1525,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,Would I!
1526,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"I know what you must be thinking, we're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here."
1527,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,Hm-hmm.
1528,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"The Gan Jin think so badly of us, they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in."
1529,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,Hmm.
1530,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years. Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison. We Zhangs will never forget that injustice."
1531,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,That's just terrible. You gonna finish that?
1532,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts! Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts."
1533,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"Lonely isn't it, being impartial?"
1534,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here."
1535,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated.
1536,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,"All clear, we're almost to the other side."
1537,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?"
1538,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb."
1539,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,What are you talking about?
1540,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,"Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin."
1541,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,Not punished enough if you ask me.
1542,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Okay, okay I get it! Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff."
1543,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall with their long disgusting fingernails.
1544,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,"Oh sorry, I forgot that to the Gan Jin unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!"
1545,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,"Why, you dirty thief!"
1546,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,You pompous fool!
1547,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Guys, focus! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!"
1548,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,Perhaps the Avatar is right.
1549,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,"Yes, perhaps he is."
1550,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,Harsh words will ''never'' solve our problems.
1551,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,Action will!
1552,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!
1553,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"You know, I take it back. Harsh words aren't so bad!"
1554,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,Is that ... food? Everyone smuggled food down here? Unbelievable! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day? You're all awful! So hungry. Is that an egg custard in that tart?
1555,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers."
1556,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,We barely survived one!
1557,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,They're coming back for me! They've had a taste and they're coming back for me!
1558,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,"Sokka, wait. I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive."
1559,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,Me too. I only took their side 'cause they fed me.
1560,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Everybody, watch me and do what I do! Now follow me! We're riding out of this hole! Everyone, get off!"
1561,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,We made it!
1562,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.
1563,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,And I never knew you Zhangs were so reliable in a pinch.
1564,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,Perhaps we're not so different after all.
1565,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei!
1566,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,You tyrants unjustly imprisoned Wei Jin for twenty long years!
1567,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,Wait a second ... Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!
1568,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,"Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story."
1569,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?
1570,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Nope, just a regular ball."
1571,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin man,What about our tribe's redemption ritual?
1572,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell ""redemption""! Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field."
1573,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,I suppose it's time we forget the past.
1574,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,And look to the future.
1575,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Good to see you, boy. Did you miss me?"
1576,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,"I cannot thank you enough, Avatar."
1577,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,"Well, you know I try."
1578,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Gan Jin leader,Ugh!
1579,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Zhang leader,Let us travel to the Earth Kingdom capital as one tribe.
1580,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Canyon guide,I'm going too! I'm sick of this place!
1581,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.
1582,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,You could call it luck. Or you could call it lying.
1583,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Sokka,What?
1584,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,I made the whole thing up.
1585,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Katara,You did ''not''! That is ''so'' wrong.
1586,1,The Great Divide,Water,1,11,Aang,Now where is that custard tart? I'm starving!
1587,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"We need you, Aang."
1588,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Be careful, guys! Guys?"
1589,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,Gyatso?
1590,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,Why did you disappear?
1591,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,"We need you, Aang."
1592,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso and Katara,"We need you, Aang. We need you. We need you, Aang. We need you."
1593,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,What's going on? Did we get captured again?
1594,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,Don't have to tell me twice.
1595,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"Are you all right, Aang?"
1596,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I'm okay.
1597,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately. You want to tell me about it?
1598,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I think I just need some rest.
1599,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Look at those clear skies, buddy! Should be some smooth flying."
1600,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"Well, we better ''smoothly'' fly ourselves to a market, 'cause we're out of food."
1601,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,"Guys, wait. This was in my dream. We shouldn't go to the market."
1602,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,There is a storm coming. A big one.
1603,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,"You're out of your mind, Uncle. The weather's perfect. There's not a cloud in sight."
1604,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,A storm is approaching from the north. I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.
1605,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,"We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same."
1606,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,The safety of the crew doesn't matter!
1607,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.
1608,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,He doesn't mean that. He's just all worked up.
1609,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Merchant woman,"Ahhh, it's good. It's perfect, I'm telling you!"
1610,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.
1611,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe."
1612,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,I just realized we're out of money anyway.
1613,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Shopkeeper,Awww!
1614,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do?
1615,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"You could get a job, smart guy."
1616,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,"We shouldn't go out there! Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm."
1617,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"You're crazy. It's a nice day: No clouds, no winds, no nothing. So quit your nagging, woman."
1618,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,Maybe we should find some shelter?
1619,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,Are you kidding? Shelter from ''what''?
1620,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.
1621,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"Well, it's your joints against my brain."
1622,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,"Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, 'cause I ain't comin'."
1623,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him ''double'' what you get! How do you like that?
1624,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,I'll go.
1625,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,You're hired!
1626,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,What? You said get a job ... and he's ''paying double''.
1627,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,Double? Who told you that nonsense?
1628,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Lieutenant Jee,Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.
1629,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,Lucky guess.
1630,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,"What do ''you'' know about ''respect''? The way you talk to everyone around here, from your hard-working crew to your esteemed uncle, shows you know ''nothing'' about respect! You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a ''spoiled prince''?"
1631,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,I don't need your help keeping order on my ship.
1632,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky."
1633,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,I said I was going to do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.
1634,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!
1635,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"Boy with tattoos? Airbender tattoos. Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle. You're the Avatar, ain't ya?"
1636,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,That's right.
1637,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"Well, don't be so smiley about it. The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years! You turned your back on the world!"
1638,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone.
1639,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"Oh, he wouldn't, huh? Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering."
1640,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? Aang, what's wrong?"
1641,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,That's right! Keep flying!
1642,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"You're a horrible old man! Appa, yip yip!"
1643,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,Hey! They left without saying good-bye!
1644,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"Your friends ain't too polite, are they?"
1645,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,"I know! This one time, I was ..."
1646,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck!"
1647,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I'm sorry for running away.
1648,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,It's okay. That fisherman was ''way'' out of line.
1649,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Actually, he wasn't."
1650,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,What do you mean?
1651,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I don't want to talk about it.
1652,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"It has to do with your dream, doesn't it? Talk to me."
1653,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Well, it's kind of a long story."
1654,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,I'm going to try to get a little fire going.
1655,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter.
1656,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"First you got to form the ball, then you got to get on quick."
1657,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,You kind of have to balance on it like it's a top.
1658,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I made it up.
1659,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,"Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you."
1660,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,How do you know it's me?
1661,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Tashi,We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these?
1662,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!
1663,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Tashi,"You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives."
1664,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I just chose them because they seemed fun.
1665,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Tashi,You chose them because they were familiar.
1666,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,"Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned sixteen, but there are troubling signs. Storm clouds are gathering."
1667,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Pasang,"I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar."
1668,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,"We need you, Aang."
1669,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,"I'm sick of taking his orders! I'm tired of chasing his Avatar! I mean, who does Zuko think he is?"
1670,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,Do you really want to know?
1671,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,General Iroh. We were just-
1672,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,It's okay. May I join you?
1673,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,"Of course, sir."
1674,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,Try to understand. My nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much.
1675,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Young Zuko,Let me in!
1676,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,"Prince Zuko, what's wrong?"
1677,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Young Zuko,I want to go into the war chamber but the guard won't let me pass!
1678,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,"You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring."
1679,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Young Zuko,"If I'm going to rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?"
1680,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,"Very well. But you must promise not to speak. These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?"
1681,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Young Zuko,"Thank you, Uncle."
1682,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Bujing,The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here. A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors. So I am recommending the forty-first division.
1683,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Elder soldier,But the forty-first is entirely new recruits. How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?
1684,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Bujing,''I don't''. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait than fresh meat?
1685,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Young Zuko,You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?
1686,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,"Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences."
1687,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?
1688,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing."
1689,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!"
1690,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,Great! What's going on?
1691,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"But I'm still the same! Nothing's changed! So, what? I can't play?"
1692,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Oh, okay."
1693,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,"Very interesting move, young one."
1694,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,What do you mean?
1695,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,Hey!
1696,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Tashi,You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training!
1697,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,Aang has already trained enough for today.
1698,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Tashi,Time is short. Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques.
1699,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,"No. As long as I'm his guardian, I will decide when he trains ... and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho."
1700,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Tashi,Hmph.
1701,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,"After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him. He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this."
1702,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,Agni Kai. A fire duel.
1703,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Then, just when I was feeling better, something worse happened."
1704,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.
1705,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Tashi,You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.
1706,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Pasang,"Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment."
1707,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,All I want is what is best for him.
1708,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Pasang,But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.
1709,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say."
1710,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!
1711,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,Whoa! Hot cinders!
1712,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I'm sorry I got so mad.
1713,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.
1714,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Well, that's not exactly what happened. I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do."
1715,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Gyatso,"Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?"
1716,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"I never saw Gyatso again. Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg."
1717,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,You ran away.
1718,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.
1719,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,You don't know what would have-.
1720,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.
1721,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,Aang ...
1722,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world!
1723,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,"You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders."
1724,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,You don't know that.
1725,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.
1726,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,"When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy."
1727,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Young Zuko,"Please, Father. I only had the Fire Nation's best interest at heart. I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!"
1728,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Ozai,You will fight for your honor.
1729,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Ozai,"Rise and ''fight'', Prince Zuko!"
1730,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Young Zuko,I ''won't'' fight you.
1731,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Ozai,"You ''will'' learn respect, and ''suffering'' will be your teacher."
1732,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident.
1733,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,"It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor."
1734,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.
1735,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope.
1736,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,"Help! Oh, please help!"
1737,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,It's okay. You're safe.
1738,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,But my husband isn't.
1739,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,What do you mean? Where's Sokka?
1740,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,They haven't returned! They should have been back by now! And this storm is becoming a typhoon! They're caught out at sea!
1741,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I'm going to find him!
1742,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,I'm going with you!
1743,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,I'm staying here.
1744,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,We'll be back soon. I promise.
1745,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,Where were we hit?
1746,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,I don't know!
1747,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,Look!
1748,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,The helmsman!
1749,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,Where are they?
1750,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Come on, Appa! The boat! There!"
1751,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,The Avatar!
1752,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Jee,"What do you want to do, sir?"
1753,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,Let him go. We need to get this ship to safety.
1754,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.
1755,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,I'm too young to die!
1756,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"I'm not, but I still don't wanna!"
1757,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,Hang onto the rope.
1758,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Zuko,"Uncle, I'm sorry."
1759,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Iroh,Your apology is accepted.
1760,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman's wife,"Oh, you're alive! You owe this boy an apology!"
1761,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,He doesn't have to apologize.
1762,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"What if, instead of an apology, I give him a free fish and we call it even?"
1763,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Actually, I don't eat meat."
1764,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,Fish ain't meat!
1765,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,"Seriously, you're still going to pay me, right?"
1766,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,"Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past."
1767,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,Really?
1768,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it.
1769,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Katara,I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.
1770,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Fisherman,"And if you weren't here now, well, I guess I wouldn't be either. Thank you for saving my life, Avatar."
1771,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Sokka,Do you hear that? It stopped raining.
1772,1,The Storm,Water,1,12,Aang,Appa!
1773,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,"Colonel Shinu, please reconsider ... Their precision is legendary. The Yuyan can pin a fly to a tree from one hundred yards away ... without killing it. You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards."
1774,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Shinu,"I can do whatever I want with their talents, they're ''my'' archers, and what I say goes."
1775,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,But my search for the Avatar is-
1776,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Shinu,"Is nothing but a vanity project! We're fighting a ''real'' war here, and I need every man I've got, commander."
1777,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,But-!
1778,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Shinu,That's final! I don't wanna hear another word about it!
1779,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,News from Fire Lord Ozai?
1780,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request ... is now an order.
1781,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Katara,This should bring your fever down.
1782,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Sokka,You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.
1783,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Katara,That's nice. I'll tell him.
1784,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Sokka,Classic Appa.
1785,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,How's Sokka doing?
1786,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Katara,"Not so good, being out in that storm really did a number on him."
1787,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea. But I found a map. There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.
1788,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Katara,"Aang, he's in no condition for travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow."
1789,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Not you too!
1790,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Katara,"Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fi-"
1791,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him! He thinks he's an earthbender!
1792,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Sokka,"Take that, you rock!"
1793,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,"A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too. I'm going to go find some medicine! Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. Keep an eye on them guys."
1794,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Sokka,"Ha, ha! You guys are killing me!"
1795,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Captain,"We haven't been able to pick up the Avatar's trail since the storm, but if we continue heading northeast ..."
1796,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zuko,What do they want?
1797,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Iroh,"Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho!"
1798,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Soldier,The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance. All information regarding the Avatar ''must'' be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.
1799,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Iroh,"Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him!"
1800,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zuko,I've got nothing to report to Admiral Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass.
1801,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Soldier,Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.
1802,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zuko,Off my ship!
1803,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Iroh,Excellent! I take the pot! But you're all improving! I'm certain you will win if we play again.
1804,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Sokka,"Katara, please, water."
1805,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Katara,"Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water. Got it?"
1806,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,"Hello, I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I ''need'' some medicine for my friends, they have fevers and they were coughing-"
1807,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,"Settle down, young man. Your friends are going to be fine. I've been up here for over forty years you know, used to be others, but they all left years ago. Now it's just me and Miyuki."
1808,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,That's nice.
1809,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,"Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys, and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive."
1810,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,That's nice. Are you almost done?
1811,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,"Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient. Oh, sandalwood ... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf? Ah, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?"
1812,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Iroh,Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.
1813,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zuko,I don't care what they do.
1814,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Iroh,Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.
1815,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zuko,"How, Uncle? With Zhao's resources, it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar. My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all."
1816,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,Ah! Plum blossom!
1817,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Finally! Thanks for all your help!
1818,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,Hands off!
1819,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Ow!
1820,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,What do you think you're doing?
1821,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Taking the cure to my friends.
1822,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,What about my friends?
1823,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,"Well, all they need are some frozen wood frogs. There's plenty down in the valley swamp."
1824,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?
1825,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,"Why, suck on them of course!"
1826,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,"The frog skin excretes a substance that will cure your friends. Be sure to get plenty because once those little critters thaw out, they're useless!"
1827,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,"You're insane, aren't you?"
1828,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Herbalist,"That's right! Well, don't stand there all day! Go!"
1829,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Uh ... I think you dropped this ... A frog!
1830,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,"So this is the great Avatar. Master of all the elements. I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but your little game of hide and seek is over."
1831,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,I've never hidden from you! Untie me and I'll fight you right now!
1832,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,"Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left? Do you miss your people? Don't worry, you won't be killed like they were. See, if you die you will just be reborn and the Fire Nation would have to start searching all over again. So I'll keep you alive, but just barely. Blow all the wind you want, but your situation is futile. There is no escaping this fortress, and no one is coming to rescue you."
1833,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Sokka,Water ...
1834,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Katara,Momo should be back any minute.
1835,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Guard,All clear.
1836,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Guard,All clear. Go on in.
1837,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,"We are the sons and daughters of fire, the superior element! Until today only one thing stood our path to victory, the Avatar. I am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner! This is the year Sozin's Comet returns to grant us its power! This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba Sing Se and burns the city to the ground!"
1838,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,"What? No! Don't leave, frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! Please go back to being frozen!"
1839,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,"Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me? I'll take that as a ""yes."""
1840,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out! Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!
1841,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Katara,"How many times do I have to tell you, Momo? We need water, wa-ter. Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry."
1842,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Sokka,"Who's this ""Aang"" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?"
1843,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Scribe,"Sir, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord?"
1844,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Soldier,"There, on the wall!"
1845,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,The Avatar has escaped! Close all the gates immediately!
1846,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Stay close to me!
1847,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Take this. Jump on my back!
1848,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Give me the next one!
1849,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,Hold your fire! The Avatar must be captured alive!
1850,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,Open the gate.
1851,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Officer,"Admiral, what are you doing?"
1852,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,"Let them out, now!"
1853,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Officer,How could you let them go?
1854,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,A situation like this requires ... precision.
1855,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,Do you have a clear shot?
1856,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,Knock out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with the Avatar.
1857,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zhao,Quick! Recover the Avatar!
1858,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,"You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?"
1859,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Iroh,"Where have you been, Prince Zuko? You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song."
1860,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Zuko,I'm going to bed. No disturbances.
1861,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,Suck on these. They'll make you feel better.
1862,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Aang,"No, I don't think I did."
1863,1,The Blue Spirit,Water,1,13,Sokka,Mmmm! This is tasty! Mmm!
1864,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Look!
1865,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,He is taunting us! You are so going to be dinner!
1866,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Hey, where's the fishing line?"
1867,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka."
1868,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Aw, it's all tangled!"
1869,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Not tangled. Woven! I made you a necklace, Katara. I thought since you lost your other one ..."
1870,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Thanks, Aang. I love it."
1871,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Great, Aang. Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business."
1872,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,I don't see why I can't do both.
1873,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Stop taunting me!
1874,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"So, how do I look?"
1875,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"You mean, all of you or just your neck? I mean, because they both look great!"
1876,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love!"
1877,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"I ... well, uh ..."
1878,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. A sweet, little guy! Just like Momo."
1879,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Thanks.
1880,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!
1881,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"Well, hello there! Nice day, isn't it?"
1882,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Make noise! He'll run off!
1883,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"No, play dead! He'll lose interest!"
1884,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"Whoa, close one!"
1885,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Run downhill, then climb a tree!"
1886,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"No, punch him in the bill!"
1887,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,And then run in zig-zags!
1888,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"No need, it's going to be fine!"
1889,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Whoa there!
1890,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Mmm, lunch! Lucky for you, we came along."
1891,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"Thanks, but everything was already under control. Not to worry. Aunt Wu predicted I'd have a safe journey."
1892,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Aunt who?
1893,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"No, Aunt ''Wu''. She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice knowing your future."
1894,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm!"
1895,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"But I wasn't! All right, have a good one! Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met any travelers to give them this."
1896,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.
1897,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Oh, come on. Fortune telling is nonsense!"
1898,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,What do you know? An umbrella!
1899,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,That proves it!
1900,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"No, it doesn't! You can't ''really'' tell the future!"
1901,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,I guess you're not ''really'' getting wet then.
1902,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Of course she predicted it was going to rain. The sky's been gray all day!
1903,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella."
1904,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Look, I'm going to predict the future now. It's going to keep drizzling. See?"
1905,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Not everyone has the gift, Sokka."
1906,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Agh!
1907,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Strange Man,Aunt Wu is expecting you.
1908,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Really?
1909,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,My name is Meng and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.
1910,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"Well, hello there."
1911,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Hello.
1912,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,Can I get you some tea or some of Aunt Wu's special bean curd puffs?
1913,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I'll try a curd puff.
1914,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,Just a second. So what's your name?
1915,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Aang.
1916,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?"
1917,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,I guess.
1918,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Don't be modest! They're huge!
1919,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"Well, Aang, it was very nice to meet you. ''Very'' nice."
1920,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Likewise.
1921,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.
1922,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?"
1923,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.
1924,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Woman,"Oh, Meng! Aunt Wu says I'm going to meet my true love. He's going to give me a rare panda lily."
1925,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,That's so romantic! I wonder if my true love will give ''me'' a rare flower.
1926,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Good luck with that!
1927,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Woman,Is that the big-eared guy who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?
1928,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,Enjoy your snack!
1929,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"Welcome, young travelers. Now, who's next? Don't be shy."
1930,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,I guess that's me.
1931,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Boring stuff I'm sure. Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have."
1932,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Yeah, dumb stuff like that ... Well, I've got to find a bathroom."
1933,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,Your palms are so smooth. Do you use moisturizer?
1934,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,I feel a great romance for you. The man you are going to marry.
1935,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Tell me more!
1936,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,I can see that he's a very powerful bender.
1937,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.
1938,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Yeah ... when I was in there ...
1939,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I don't even want to know!
1940,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,Who's next?
1941,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Okay, let's get this over with."
1942,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"Your future is full of struggle and anguish. Most of it, self-inflicted."
1943,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,But you didn't read my palms or anything!
1944,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie. Go on, pick one. Now throw it on the fire. The heat makes cracks in the bone and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny."
1945,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Wow, that's a big crack."
1946,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,I've never seen this before!
1947,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"Oh my! Your destiny! This is incredible. You will be involved in a great battle, an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil. A battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!"
1948,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl?"
1949,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,A girl? You want to know about ''love''?
1950,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Yes!
1951,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything."
1952,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Really? Thank you, Aunt Wu!"
1953,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax."
1954,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.
1955,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful!
1956,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,That doesn't prove ''anything''!
1957,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Well, I liked my predictions. Certain things are going to turn out very well."
1958,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,They sure are ...
1959,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Why? What did she tell you?
1960,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Some stuff. You'll find out.
1961,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,What's with the sky?
1962,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds to predict the fate of the whole village.
1963,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny.
1964,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,You better hope that's not a bunny! The fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction.
1965,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Do you even hear yourself?
1966,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Village Woman,The cloud reading will tell us if Mt. Makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt.
1967,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain to check the volcano ourselves. But every since Aunt Wu moved to the village twenty years ago, we have a tradition of ''not'' doing that."
1968,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition!"
1969,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Shhh! She's coming!
1970,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"Hey, Aang. Don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?"
1971,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Shhh!
1972,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,Bending arrow cloud ... good crops this year. Nice big harvest.
1973,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Farmer,Darn good news!
1974,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"Wavy, moon-shaped cloud ... let's see. Gonna be a great year for twins!"
1975,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Poi and Ping,Yes!
1976,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it ... The village will ''not'' be destroyed by the volcano this year!
1977,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal."
1978,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Never mind.
1979,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Hi, Aunt Wu! Sorry to bother you."
1980,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,Any time.
1981,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"About this man I'm supposed to marry ... Is he going to be handsome? Oh, I hope he's tall!"
1982,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,Ah ... You want another reading?
1983,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Yes, please!"
1984,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I can't believe all these saps! Someone really needs to scream some sense into them.
1985,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"They seem happy, Sokka."
1986,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Not for long. I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense. Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?"
1987,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Man,Yeah. She said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love.
1988,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?
1989,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Man,Everyday.
1990,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Man,Really? You think so? I'm so excited!
1991,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,And then you will have your third great-grandchild before quietly passing away in your sleep. Is that enough information for you?
1992,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Wow, thanks, Aunt Wu. Oh wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow?"
1993,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,You want me to do a reading for ''that''?
1994,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I don't care what Aunt Wu told you! You have to take a bath sometime!
1995,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?"
1996,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,''Some'' stuff? You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?
1997,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Well, there's this girl."
1998,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I think I know who you mean.
1999,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,You do? And you're okay with it?
2000,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Of course I am. And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too."
2001,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Oh yeah, she's crazy about you. All you have to do now is not mess it up."
2002,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Well, how do I do that?"
2003,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.
2004,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,You can be too nice?
2005,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Yep. If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other."
2006,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Well, okay ..."
2007,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"Hey, Aang, I was wondering ..."
2008,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,See you later ...
2009,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Wow, that kid is good."
2010,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,And you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye-bye now.
2011,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Okay, okay, but one more thing."
2012,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"All right, what is it?"
2013,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?
2014,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,Papaya!
2015,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Aww, I hate papaya."
2016,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Oh, hey, Katara. I didn't see you there."
2017,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Hey, Aang."
2018,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,That's okay. I'm busy with my own stuff.
2019,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Ugh, papaya please."
2020,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,So ... papaya.
2021,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Uh huh. Would you like some?
2022,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,You know me. I don't really care what I eat.
2023,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Okay then. See you later.
2024,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Maybe aloof isn't my style.
2025,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Did you see that?
2026,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Excuse me. Where can a guy find one of those things?
2027,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower.
2028,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Not just any flower, a panda lily. I've seen it in action and boy, does it work."
2029,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness."
2030,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love."
2031,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too."
2032,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love? There! On the rim!"
2033,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Oh no. Aunt Wu was wrong.
2034,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Those people all think they're safe! We've got to warn them!
2035,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,There's no time to walk! Grab on!
2036,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Hi, Katara."
2037,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?
2038,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,But she doesn't even charge.
2039,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"I know, but still ..."
2040,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano."
2041,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my mind -"
2042,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,Oh no.
2043,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second! Aunt Wu was wrong!"
2044,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Village Woman,"Yeah, yeah, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, Mr. science and reason lover."
2045,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes."
2046,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears."
2047,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Look! Can your fortune telling explain that?
2048,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Man with Red Shoes,Can your science explain why it rains?
2049,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,They just won't listen to reason.
2050,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,But they ''will'' listen to Aunt Wu!
2051,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I know that's the problem.
2052,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book."
2053,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Shhh! We don't want anyone to hear us.
2054,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Oh, I didn't see you there."
2055,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"You don't like me, do you?"
2056,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Of course I like you.
2057,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,But not the way I like you.
2058,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Oh, I guess not."
2059,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"It's okay. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way."
2060,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,I know what you mean.
2061,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"She's beautiful, by the way."
2062,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Huh?
2063,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,"That Water Tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much. She's sweet, she's a bender and her hair seems so manageable."
2064,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,How did you know?
2065,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,I've kind of been stalking you. Heh ...
2066,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Oh, thanks ... I guess."
2067,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"Clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want."
2068,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom.
2069,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds."
2070,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,We still can save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan.
2071,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.
2072,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"If any of you are earthbenders, come with me."
2073,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Poi,I'm an earthbender!
2074,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Ping,I'm not!
2075,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Everybody else grab a shovel Come on! We've gotta hurry!
2076,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,Dig faster! Dig faster!
2077,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!
2078,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,It's too much! It's gonna overflow!
2079,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Man, sometimes I forget what a powerful bender that kid is."
2080,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Wait, what did you just say?"
2081,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender."
2082,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"By the way, we kind of borrowed your book."
2083,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"So you messed with the clouds, did you?"
2084,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,Very clever!
2085,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,"No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling."
2086,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Calm man,"But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed and it wasn't. She was right, after all."
2087,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Sokka,I hate you.
2088,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"It's okay, Sokka. Everything's going to be all right."
2089,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,Can I ask you something?
2090,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Wu,"Of course, honey."
2091,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Aang,"You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear."
2092,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Katara,"Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng."
2093,1,The Fortuneteller,Water,1,14,Meng,Take care! Floozy.
2094,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Hey, look! A sword made out of a whale's tooth."
2095,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Let me see that.
2096,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,This is a Water Tribe weapon. See if you can find anything else.
2097,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Did someone lose something?
2098,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"It's burned. There was a battle! Water Tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders. The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill."
2099,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"So, then what happened?"
2100,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,I don't know. The trail ends here.
2101,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"Wait, look!"
2102,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,It's one of our boats!
2103,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Is this dad's boat?
2104,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"No, but it's from his fleet. Dad was here."
2105,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Iroh,"Aahh! See Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being."
2106,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Firebenders,Look out! Argh!
2107,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,Get back! We're after a stowaway!
2108,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,There are no stowaways on my ship.
2109,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,He's paralyzed.
2110,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,"Only temporarily. The toxins will wear off in about an hour. But by then, he'll be in jail and I'll have my money."
2111,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,But how did you find him on my ship?
2112,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,My shirshu can smell a rat a continent away.
2113,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Hakoda,Sokka.
2114,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,I'm coming with you.
2115,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Hakoda,"You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that."
2116,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"I'm strong, I'm brave, I can fight! Please, Dad!"
2117,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,I don't understand.
2118,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Hakoda,Someday you will. I'm gonna miss you so much.
2119,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Who's there?
2120,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,Sokka?
2121,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Bato?
2122,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Who the what now?
2123,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Bato!
2124,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,Sokka! Katara! It is so good to see you two. You've grown so much!
2125,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Hi, I'm Aang."
2126,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Where's Dad?
2127,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Is he here?
2128,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"No, he and the other warriors should be in the Eastern Earth Kingdom by now. This is no place for a reunion. Let's get inside."
2129,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey. The sisters have cared for me ever since. Superior, these are Hakoda's children. They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat."
2130,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Mother Superior,"Young Avatar, it gives me great joy to be in your presence. Welcome to our abbey."
2131,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Thank you, it's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything-"
2132,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"What smells so good, Bato?"
2133,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,The sisters craft ointments and perfumes.
2134,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"Perfume? Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much. Am I right?"
2135,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,You have your father's wit.
2136,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"Bato, it looks like home!"
2137,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"Everything's here, even the pelts!"
2138,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Yeah, nothing's cozier than dead animal skins."
2139,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,No way! Stewed sea prunes!
2140,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,Help yourself!
2141,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things!
2142,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"Bato, is it true that you and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?"
2143,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"It was your father's idea, he just dragged me along. Well, the hippo did the dragging!"
2144,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Hey, I ride animals, too! There was this one time when I rode a giant eel and I-"
2145,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"So, who was it that came up with the Great Blubber Fiasco?"
2146,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,You knew about that?
2147,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Everyone does!
2148,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,What's that story?
2149,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"It's a long one Aang, some other time."
2150,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.
2151,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything's funny in hindsight. Hey, Aang! Please put that down, it's ceremonial and very fragile."
2152,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?
2153,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"Your dad wore the octopus, but I did the spooky voice."
2154,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,"Out of my way! Step aside, filth!"
2155,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Iroh,He means no offense! I'm certain you bathe regularly!
2156,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,I need to talk to you!
2157,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,"Well, if it isn't my new friends: Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy."
2158,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,Your beast trashed my ship. You ''have'' to pay me back!
2159,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,"Well, I'd love to help you out, but I'm a little short on money. Drinks on me!"
2160,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,Money isn't what I had in mind.
2161,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,I need you to find someone.
2162,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,"What happened, your girlfriend run off on you?"
2163,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,"It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with."
2164,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,Whatever you say.
2165,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,"If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship ''paid for''."
2166,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,"Heh, forget it."
2167,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Iroh,"Plus, we'll pay your weight in ''gold''."
2168,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,"Make it ''your'' weight, and we gotta deal."
2169,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Iroh,You got it!
2170,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,Get on!
2171,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,There's something I should tell you kids. I'm expecting a message from your father.
2172,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Really?
2173,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,When?
2174,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"Any day now. Your father said he'd send a message when they found the rendezvous point. If you wait until the message arrives, you can come with me, and see your father again."
2175,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,It's been over two years since we've seen Dad. That would be so incredible! Katara!
2176,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"I do really miss him, it would be ''great'' to see Dad."
2177,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"It's been far too long, hasn't it? I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does-"
2178,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first."
2179,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"Even if we do have time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel. We don't have time for a long detour."
2180,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"I'm sure your father would understand, and be proud that his children are helping the Avatar."
2181,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,I can't believe they would leave me.
2182,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Messenger,I'm looking for Bato of the Water Tribe.
2183,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Uhhh, I know Bato!"
2184,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Messenger,Make sure he gets this!
2185,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,It's the map to Sokka and Katara's dad!
2186,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.
2187,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"Hey, Aang, I didn't notice you left."
2188,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Yup, but now I'm back. Sure could go for some delicious sea prunes!"
2189,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Herbalist,"Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?"
2190,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,We're looking for someone.
2191,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Herbalist,"I hope it's not Miyuki Miyuki, did you get in trouble with the Fire Nation, again?"
2192,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,The Avatar's been through here. Let's keep moving.
2193,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Mother Superior,Aha! I caught you. You should be ashamed of yourself ... Littering in the courtyard.
2194,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"I'm sorry, I'll take care of this."
2195,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,This ship is sentimental to me. It was built by my father.
2196,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Is this the boat he took you ice dodging in?
2197,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,Yep! It's got the scar to prove it. Ha. How 'bout you Sokka? You must have some good stories from your first time ice dodging.
2198,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough.
2199,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"Oh, I forgot you were too young."
2200,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,What's ice dodging?
2201,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"It's a rite of passage for young Water Tribe members. When you turn fourteen, your dad takes you- You know what, you're about to find out!"
2202,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,Why are we stopping?
2203,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,Because the girl must have spent a lot of time here.
2204,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,We have no time for this!
2205,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,Hey! Watch it!
2206,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,"Oh look, he likes you!"
2207,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aunt Wu,"Care to hear your fortune, handsome?"
2208,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Iroh,"At my age, there's really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery."
2209,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"Ice dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery, and trust. In our village, ice dodging was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs."
2210,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,How are we supposed to ice dodge without ice?
2211,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"You'll be dodging those. Sokka, you steer and call the shots, lead wisely. Katara, you secure the main sail. The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib. Without your steady hand, we all go down. Your position is about trust."
2212,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"For this is to be done right, I cannot help. You pass or fail on your own."
2213,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady. Aang, less sail. Katara, give him room. Aang, helm to lee. Helm to lee!"
2214,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,What does that even mean?
2215,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Great job!
2216,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,There's no way through!
2217,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,We can make it.
2218,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"Sokka, you've already proven yourself. Maybe we should-"
2219,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail. Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks. Now!"
2220,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"The spirits of water bear witness to these marks. For Sokka, the Mark of the Wise. The same mark your father earned. For Katara, the Mark of the Brave. Your courage inspires us. And for Aang, the Mark of the Trusted. You are now an honorary member of the Water Tribe."
2221,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,I can't.
2222,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Of course you can!
2223,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"No, you can't trust me."
2224,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"Aang, what are you talking about?"
2225,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,A messenger gave this to me for Bato. You ''have'' to understand. I was afraid you would-
2226,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time? How could you? Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own. I'm going to find Dad."
2227,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"Well, Sokka. I think you should-"
2228,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"Katara, are you with me?"
2229,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,I'm with you Sokka.
2230,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Good luck.
2231,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Okay. You too.
2232,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Guess I should be moving on.
2233,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Mother Superior,That would be best.
2234,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"I'm an idiot, Momo."
2235,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,We're getting close.
2236,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,That wolf sounds so sad.
2237,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,It's probably wounded.
2238,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain. It's how I felt when the Water Tribe warriors had to leave me behind. They were my family, and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds."
2239,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Sokka?
2240,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"We need to go back. I wanna see Dad, but, helping Aang is where we're needed the most."
2241,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,You're right.
2242,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,"Your father will understand, and I know he's proud of you."
2243,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"Thanks, Bato."
2244,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Bato,I know where to go from here. Take this in case you want to find us. I'll leave a message at the rendezvous point.
2245,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Looks like we're going alone, guys."
2246,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Mother Superior,"Avatar, you must leave!"
2247,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone."
2248,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Mother Superior,A group of people came to the abbey looking for you.
2249,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Who?
2250,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Mother Superior,"A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster, and a young man with a scar."
2251,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Zuko.
2252,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Mother Superior,The beast was using the scent of a necklace to follow you.
2253,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,A necklace? Katara!
2254,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,"So this is your girlfriend. No wonder she left, she's way too pretty for you."
2255,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,Where is he? Where is the Avatar?
2256,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,We split up. He's long gone.
2257,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,How stupid do you think I am?
2258,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,Pretty stupid. Run!
2259,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,What are we supposed to do now?
2260,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,It's seeking a different scent. Perhaps something that the Avatar held.
2261,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,What's it doing? It's just going in a circle.
2262,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,Aang!
2263,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,Up!
2264,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,June,Come on! Get up!
2265,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,I'm ... starting to get some feeling back! Ow.
2266,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,You've got something I want.
2267,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at.
2268,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Mother Superior,The perfume?
2269,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Iroh,June! No!
2270,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Zuko,Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.
2271,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Iroh,Shhh.
2272,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,So ... where do we go?
2273,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,We're getting ''you'' to the North Pole.
2274,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"Yeah, we've lost too much time as it is."
2275,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Don't you want to see your father?
2276,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,"Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family, too. And right now, you need us more."
2277,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,And ''we'' need you.
2278,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you ..."
2279,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,I'll be okay.
2280,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,"Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like ... this?"
2281,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"Aang, how'd you get that?"
2282,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Zuko asked me to be ''sure'' I got it to you.
2283,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"Aw, that's so sweet of Zuko. Could you give him a kiss for me when you see him?"
2284,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Sure.
2285,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"So, how long do you think it's been since someone was here?"
2286,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,I wonder why they left this boat? There's nothing wrong with it.
2287,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,When was the last time you saw your dad?
2288,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Sokka,I don't want to talk about it.
2289,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Aang,Sorry. I didn't mean to bring that up.
2290,1,Bato of the Water Tribe,Water,1,15,Katara,"It's okay Aang. Our dad left about two years ago, with all the other Water Tribe men."
2291,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,This should give us a good idea of what's around here.
2292,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"See if you can find a menu, I'm starving!"
2293,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"I bet we'll find something to eat here, the Fire Day's Festival. Fire Nation cultural exhibits, jugglers, benders, magicians ... This would be a great place for me to study some real firebenders."
2294,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Hey, a poster of me!"
2295,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,A wanted poster! This is bad.
2296,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,I think we better keep moving.
2297,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I have to learn firebending at some point and this could be my only chance to watch a master's up close.
2298,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave."
2299,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival. Ready disguises!
2300,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,It's like you're a whole different person ...
2301,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Let's go.
2302,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,I think we need some new disguises.
2303,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,Where are we gonna get masks like that?
2304,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Mask dealer,Get your genuine Fire Festival masks here!
2305,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,That was surprisingly easy.
2306,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Hey, there's some food."
2307,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,Finally! What do you have?
2308,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Shop keeper,Flaming fire flakes! Best in town.
2309,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,I'll take'em!
2310,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,Aaahhh! Hot! Hot!
2311,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"""Flaming fire flakes"", hot? What do you know?"
2312,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Hey, look at this."
2313,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Puppet Fire Lord,Don't worry loyal citizens! No one can surprise the Fire Lord!
2314,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Fire Nation kids,Oh no! Look out!
2315,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"Aang, hold on! Where are we going?"
2316,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good."
2317,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution."
2318,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I gotta learn that trick!
2319,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Malu,Thank you! For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience!
2320,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Oh! Oh! Me! Me!
2321,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,What do you think you're doing?
2322,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I want to get a closer look.
2323,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.
2324,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Malu,"How about you, little lady?"
2325,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,Uh.
2326,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Malu,"Awww, she's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!"
2327,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Awww! That could've been me.
2328,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Malu,"This next trick is called ""Taming the Dragon."" You will be my captured princess! Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast! It's too strong, I can't hold it!"
2329,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,We gotta help her!
2330,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"No, we don't want to make a scene!"
2331,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Malu,"The rope, it's breaking! Hey, you tryin' to upstage me, kid?"
2332,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Citizen,Hey! That kid's the Avatar!
2333,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,I think it's time to go.
2334,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,Follow me! I can get you outta here!
2335,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Guard,There they are!
2336,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Guard,Over there!
2337,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I'm calling Appa.
2338,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!
2339,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,This way! Okay! Not this way!
2340,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Appa! Down here!
2341,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Nice touch setting off the fireworks.
2342,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,You really know your explosives ...
2343,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,I'm familiar.
2344,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,You're a Fire Nation Soldier!
2345,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,''Was.'' My name's Chey.
2346,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,"I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend, Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?"
2347,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"He was very highly ranked, we get it."
2348,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,"Yeah! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more. He's the first person ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though. Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius. Some say he's mad - but he's not! He's enlightened."
2349,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord? We've gotta go see him! He can train me!
2350,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,We're ''not'' gonna go find some ''crazy'' firebender!
2351,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the North Pole in the morning."
2352,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me."
2353,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,It can't hurt just to talk to him.
2354,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?
2355,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Lin Yee,Don't move!
2356,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Lin Yee,Jeong Jeong told you not to look for Avatar!
2357,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"Hold on, you know these guys?"
2358,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,"Oh yeh! Lin Yee's an old buddy! Right, Lin Yee?"
2359,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Lin Yee,Shut up! Keep moving.
2360,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Lin Yee,Go on. He sees you only.
2361,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,"Oh that's okay, we can chat later."
2362,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away.
2363,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Lin Yee,No! You wait there. Go now!
2364,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,"Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!"
2365,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,"So, the Avatar was here and you let him slip away?"
2366,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Guard captain,"Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch! No fights. Theft was way down."
2367,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go?
2368,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Guard captain,"They headed into the forest, up the river I suspect."
2369,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,Ready the river boats. We're going after the Avatar.
2370,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?
2371,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,He won't see you. He's very angry that I brought you here. He wants you to leave immediately.
2372,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,Finally! Let's hit the road.
2373,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Why won't he see me?
2374,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,He says you're not ready. Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.
2375,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Wait, how does he know that?"
2376,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Chey,He saw the way you walked into camp. He could tell.
2377,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"I'm going in, anyway!"
2378,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Get out.
2379,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Master, I need to learn firebending."
2380,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Only a fool seeks his own destruction.
2381,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny? If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny? No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control! He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean."
2382,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Okay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines."
2383,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself. But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out."
2384,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance."
2385,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Are you deaf? How can I teach you if you refuse to listen? Before learning firebending you must learn water and earth. Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive! It breathes, it grows. Without the bender, a rock will not throw itself! But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it! That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are too weak!"
2386,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Roku,You think I am weak?
2387,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Avatar Roku! No, No! I did not mean that."
2388,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Roku,"I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes. Now, I must do it once again. You will teach the Avatar firebending."
2389,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Yes, yes, I will teach you."
2390,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Widen your stance. Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate. Good, good!"
2391,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Wait! What do I do now?
2392,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Silence! Talking is not concentrating! Look at your friend, is she talking? Even that oaf knows to concentrate on what he's doing!"
2393,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,''Hey''!
2394,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,But what am I concentrating on?
2395,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire. Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!"
2396,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,So when do I get to make some fire?
2397,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Concentrate!
2398,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?
2399,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,No fire yet.
2400,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,What?
2401,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Power in firebending comes from the breath. That is why you must master proper breath control.
2402,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,You brought me up here to breathe?
2403,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Assume your stance.
2404,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Wider.
2405,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"''Wider!'' Now, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth - without talking. Good. Keep going."
2406,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,What are you doing here? I did not tell you to stop!
2407,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I've been breathing for hours!
2408,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,You want to stop breathing?
2409,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun! I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!
2410,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love."
2411,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"I thought about what you said, I promise I'll be more patient."
2412,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,We're going to work with fire now.
2413,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Oh yeah! I mean, let us begin."
2414,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep the flame from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.
2415,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Tribal man,Master! There is trouble.
2416,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,What's going on?
2417,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Concentrate on your leaf!
2418,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,This is the ''worst ''firebending instruction ever! All he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe!
2419,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,I'm sure there's a good reason.
2420,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,But I'm ready to do so much more.
2421,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I did it! I made fire!
2422,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow."
2423,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Now ''that's'' some firebending!
2424,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"Aang, you'll hurt yourself!"
2425,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I wonder how that juggler did it.
2426,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Katara! I'm so sorry!
2427,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"Katara, what's wrong? What did you do?!"
2428,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"It was an accident! I was, uh... Katara, I'm so--"
2429,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did! ''You burned my sister''! You burned my sister! This is all your fault!
2430,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,I know! Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.
2431,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"I'm sorry, I didn't ... I'm sorry!"
2432,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,You have healing abilities. The great benders of the Water Tribe sometimes have this ability. I've always wished I were blessed like you - free from this burning curse.
2433,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know.
2434,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart."
2435,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,Go get your friends and flee! Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!
2436,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,"Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago. Haven't you, Master Jeong Jeong?"
2437,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,Katara! Are you all right?
2438,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?"
2439,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.
2440,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,You'll have to eventually.
2441,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"No, never again."
2442,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"It's okay, Aang. I'm healed."
2443,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,What? How?
2444,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!"
2445,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Where?
2446,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.
2447,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,I have to help him!
2448,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,Look at you. You were once so great. I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.
2449,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,"It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao."
2450,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,"It's Admiral Zhao, now."
2451,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,That title will not help you against the Avatar. Do not try to fight him! You are no match!
2452,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,I think I can handle a child.
2453,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Jeong Jeong,I have never seen such raw power ...
2454,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Jeong Jeong!
2455,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!
2456,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,It's a trick! He's run off into the woods. Find him! Let's find out what my old master has taught you.
2457,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,You were Jeong Jeong's student?!
2458,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,Until I got bored.
2459,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!
2460,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Whoa! Wild shot!
2461,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,I'll show you ''wild''!
2462,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,No self-control ...
2463,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,"Stand and fight, Avatar!"
2464,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up!"
2465,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,I was ...
2466,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days! Ahoy! I'm Admiral Zhao! I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko. Sloppy. Very sloppy."
2467,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,"Nowhere to run now, you little smart mouth!"
2468,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,You've lost this battle.
2469,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Zhao,Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!
2470,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"''No'', but ''you'' have. Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint. Have a nice walk home!"
2471,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"Aang, come on! Let's go!"
2472,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?
2473,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,He disappeared. They all did.
2474,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,"Aang, you're burned! Let me help you."
2475,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,"Wow, that's good water."
2476,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,When did you learn that?
2477,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,I guess I always knew.
2478,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble. Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!
2479,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Aang,Two?
2480,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Katara,He tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook.
2481,1,The Deserter,Water,1,16,Sokka,"Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful."
2482,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Aren't airbender stories the greatest?
2483,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then?
2484,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,I laugh at gravity all the time. Gravity.
2485,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Storyteller,"Jingle, jingle!"
2486,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Sorry ...
2487,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Storyteller,"Aww, cheapskates!"
2488,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Hey! Thanks for the story.
2489,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Storyteller,"Tell it to the cap, ''boy.''"
2490,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Storyteller,"Aww, much obliged, little bat-thing."
2491,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,It means a lot to hear airbender stories. It must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met them.
2492,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Storyteller,"What are you prattling about, child? Great Grandpappy saw the air walkers last week."
2493,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,"Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo."
2494,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Do you think we'll really find airbenders?
2495,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"You want me to be like you, or totally honest?"
2496,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Are you saying I'm a liar?
2497,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing, basically."
2498,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,"Hey, guys, look at this!"
2499,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,They really are airbenders!
2500,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,"No, they're not."
2501,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"What do you mean ""they're not""? Those guys are flying!"
2502,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,"Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit."
2503,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,"I don't know, Aang. That kid seemed pretty spirited."
2504,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"We better find some solid ground, before it finds us."
2505,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Colonists,Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!
2506,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Hey there, you're pretty good!"
2507,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,"Yeah, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding."
2508,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Wow, I don't think I can do that. But here's a good one."
2509,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,What do you think?
2510,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Hey, you're a real airbender. You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I-I've heard stories about you!"
2511,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Thanks.
2512,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Wow! This glider chair is incredible!
2513,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"You think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed."
2514,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Wow!
2515,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Yeah, my dad is the mastermind behind this whole place. Everything's powered by hot air. It even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift while we're gliding."
2516,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,This place is unbelievable.
2517,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Yeah, it's great, isn't it?"
2518,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,"No, just unbelievable."
2519,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different.
2520,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,So better!
2521,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,This is supposed to be the history of my people.
2522,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Ugh!
2523,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.
2524,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined.
2525,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Man,Look out!
2526,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,What the doodle? Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse!
2527,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Do you know what you did!? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!
2528,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"Well, people around here are starting to stink."
2529,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,This whole place stinks!
2530,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way! I've seen it when the monks were here! I know what it's supposed to be like!
2531,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"The monks? But, you're twelve."
2532,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago."
2533,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,What are you doing? Who said you could be here?
2534,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"Hmm, doing here ... A long time ago, but not a hundred years, my people became refugees after a terrible flood. My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother. I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere! Pictures of flying people! But empty, nobody home. Then, I came across these fan-like contraptions!"
2535,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Our gliders.
2536,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"Yes! Little, light flying machines! They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone will be on equal ground! So to speak. We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here. And, after all, isn't that what nature does?"
2537,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Nature knows where to stop.
2538,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us. Look at the time! Come! The pulley system must be oiled before dark."
2539,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same."
2540,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,The candle will tell us. Watch.
2541,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,You put spark powder in the candle!
2542,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"Four flashes. So it's exactly four hours past mid-day. Or, as I call it: four o'candle. If you like that, wait till you see my finger-safe knife sharpener. Only took me three tries to get it right."
2543,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Aaah!
2544,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Follow me!
2545,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Hey, Aang. I want to show you something."
2546,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.
2547,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,I don't know about that. The temple might be different but the creatures that live here are probably direct descendants of the ones who lived here a long time ago.
2548,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins.
2549,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all."
2550,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,"Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple!"
2551,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Only an airbender can open it, so inside it's completely untouched. Just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it's like in there ..."
2552,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Aang?
2553,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,I'm sorry. This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that way.
2554,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,I completely understand. I just wanted you to know that it's here.
2555,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Thanks.
2556,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,These lanterns are terrible. I can't see! Why would you want to use fireflies for light?
2557,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose! Fireflies are a non-flammable light source.
2558,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Cover your nose and hold your breath.
2559,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.
2560,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"Wrong. It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high! Thought my eyebrows would never grow back. Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time, we have gas leaks. And they're nearly impossible to find."
2561,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen."
2562,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell, or touch."
2563,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you. Something even lighter than air. And that something takes over when you fly.
2564,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something.
2565,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,Impossible! Everybody has it!
2566,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Spirit.
2567,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,What?
2568,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Spirit. That's the something you're talking about.
2569,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"Yeah, I suppose it is."
2570,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,Are you ready?
2571,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,No! Aaaaah! I can't believe I'm flying!
2572,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!
2573,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,"Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me."
2574,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,"Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one! I've been thinking. If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you."
2575,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,Great!
2576,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,"Wait! How do I land this thing? What if I land over a-ack-ack-bleck! Bug! Bug! Ack, that was a bug!"
2577,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"I said don't touch anything! Oh, don't worry. That experiment's old, and that egg was just part of last week's lunch."
2578,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Ugh! Week old egg smell!
2579,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"Quick, find that egg!"
2580,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside!
2581,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!?
2582,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,That's the solution to our problem!
2583,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Yeah ... if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ...
2584,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,... The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs!
2585,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"Then, if there's a leak ..."
2586,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"... You smell rotten eggs! Then, you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from ..."
2587,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!
2588,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Both,You're a genius!
2589,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Something's wrong. I've go to go!
2590,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,This is a nightmare.
2591,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,You don't understand!
2592,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!
2593,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,You make weapons for the Fire Nation?!
2594,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,Explain all this! Now!
2595,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement. You were too young to remember this, Teo. They were going to destroy everything! Burn it to the ground! I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us! They asked what I had to offer. I offered ... my services. You must understand. I did this for you!"
2596,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,When are they coming?
2597,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Soon. Very soon.
2598,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,You can't give them more weapons.
2599,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"If I don't give them what they want, they will destroy this place!"
2600,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?
2601,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,I need some time to think. You need to leave! Go!
2602,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,We're not leaving!
2603,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Then hide! Quickly!
2604,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Qin,You know better than to keep me waiting. Give me what you owe us so we can be on our way. Well? Is there a problem?
2605,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"No, right this way."
2606,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,The deal's off.
2607,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Qin,The Avatar ...
2608,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"Aang, don't get involved!"
2609,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Qin,"If I don't get what I came here for, the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!"
2610,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Qin,Then the destruction of this temple will be on your head!
2611,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,This is bad.
2612,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Very bad!
2613,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,"Aang, what are we going to do? How can we possibly keep them all away?"
2614,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,I'll tell you how. We have something they don't. Air power. We control the sky. That's something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!
2615,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,I want to help.
2616,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Good. We'll need it.
2617,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,"We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka. This boy's a genius!"
2618,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Thank you. You're a genius!
2619,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Thank you!
2620,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, but once it did, it just kept going. You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?"
2621,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,"Ugh, if only we knew."
2622,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon."
2623,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,"Huh, that's actually pretty smart."
2624,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs: smoke, slime, fire, and ..."
2625,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Stink! Never underestimate the power of stink!
2626,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Girl,They're coming!
2627,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,Are we ready?
2628,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Yes. But where's Sokka with the war balloon?
2629,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,We'll have to start without it.
2630,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Fire Nation soldier,Take them out of the sky. Now!
2631,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,We've got them on the run! We need more slime!
2632,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Those things are unstoppable!
2633,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"I think I know how they work. I remember my dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system. Something to do with water. Works great, huh?"
2634,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Water? Can you get me close to one?
2635,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,No problem!
2636,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,We're out of bombs!
2637,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,Come on Sokka. Where's that war balloon?
2638,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?"
2639,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,The insignia! They think we're on their side.
2640,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Then I guess they won't see this coming.
2641,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Bombs away!
2642,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"Oh no, that was the last one."
2643,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,Wait a second. You smell that?
2644,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Rotten eggs! There! That's were the gas is escaping.
2645,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Mechanist,What are you doing? That's our fuel source.
2646,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,It's the only bomb we've got.
2647,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,Look! They're retreating!
2648,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,We're going down!
2649,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Katara,"No, Sokka! Hold on!"
2650,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,Get ready!
2651,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Aang,"You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now. I realized, it's like the hermit crab. Maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other."
2652,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Teo,"That means a lot, coming from you."
2653,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Sokka,"Aang you were right about air power. As long as we've got the skies, we'll have the Fire Nation on the run."
2654,1,The Northern Air Temple,Water,1,17,Qin,This defeat is the gateway to many victories.
2655,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight."
2656,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!
2657,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.
2658,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Li,Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!
2659,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,"Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war. The frozen tundra is treacherous, the landscape itself is an icy fortress. We'll need a massive invasion force."
2660,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,There it is!
2661,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,The Northern Water Tribe.
2662,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,We're finally here.
2663,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!
2664,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,"We'll find a master to teach us, no problem."
2665,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,This place is beautiful.
2666,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,Yeah ... she is ...
2667,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,"Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Four seasons ... four loves ... Four seasons ... for love."
2668,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Arnook,"Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe. And they have brought with them, someone very special, someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now ... the Avatar! We also celebrate my daughter's sixteenth birthday. Princess Yue is now of marrying age!"
2669,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,"Thank you, Father. May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times!"
2670,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Arnook,"Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!"
2671,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Hi there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe."
2672,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,Very nice to meet you.
2673,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"So ... uhhh ... you're a princess, huh? You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself."
2674,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,A lot of things! Do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here.
2675,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"My apologies, ''Prince'' Sokka."
2676,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"So, it looks like I'm going to be in town for a while. I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together?"
2677,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,Very smooth ...
2678,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Arnook,"Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar."
2679,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment."
2680,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,My friend and I can't wait to start training with you! After we relax for a couple of days.
2681,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island. If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night."
2682,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zuko,"For the last time, I'm not playing the tsungi horn!"
2683,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,"No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem."
2684,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,I'm taking your crew.
2685,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zuko,What?!
2686,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.
2687,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zuko,"Uncle, is that true?"
2688,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone ... even the cook.
2689,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can't have you getting in my way again.
2690,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,No!
2691,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,"I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko."
2692,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zuko,I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.
2693,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,"Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?"
2694,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,Just rumors. I don't think he is real.
2695,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,"He's real, all right. He's a criminal, and an enemy of the Fire Nation. But I have a feeling justice will catch up with him soon. General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands ... if you change your mind."
2696,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,I've waited for this day my whole life. I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!
2697,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,"Good morning, Master Pakku!"
2698,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"No, please, march right in. I'm not concentrating or anything."
2699,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,"Uhhh ... This is my friend, Katara. The one I told you about?"
2700,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You didn't tell me your friend was a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending."
2701,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,What do you mean you won't teach me? I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me no!
2702,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,No.
2703,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!
2704,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"Here, the women learn from Yagoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student, despite your bad attitude."
2705,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"I don't want to heal, I want to fight!"
2706,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules."
2707,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"Well, your rules stink!"
2708,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,"Yeah, they're not fair! If you won't teach Katara, then ..."
2709,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,Then what?
2710,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,Then I won't learn from you!
2711,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"Well, have fun teaching yourself! I'm sure you'll do a great job."
2712,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"Wait! Aang didn't mean that! You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku, even if he is a big jerk."
2713,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"Why don't we get started, then?"
2714,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Princess Yue, good morning! How about that picnic last night? Boy, your dad sure does know how to throw a party."
2715,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.
2716,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left. So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other."
2717,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,"Do an activity, you mean?"
2718,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,Yes ... at a place ... for some time.
2719,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,I'd love to. I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.
2720,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,Sorry.
2721,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"That's okay, it was worth it. See you tonight."
2722,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,I'm very impressed. You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.
2723,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Oh,That's some tasty gold.
2724,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pirate captain,What do you need us to do?
2725,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,I believe you're acquainted with Prince Zuko.
2726,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,Uhhh ... Hi. Are you Yagoda?
2727,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yagoda,Are you here for the healing lesson?
2728,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,I guess I am.
2729,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yagoda,Welcome ... welcome!
2730,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull."
2731,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,I'm trying ...
2732,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one?
2733,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,Thanks for the lesson.
2734,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yagoda,"So, who's the lucky boy?"
2735,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,Huh?
2736,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yagoda,"Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right?"
2737,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,Ah ... No. I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace and my mother passed it down to me.
2738,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?"
2739,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yagoda,"When I was about your age, I was friends with Kanna. She was born here in the Northern Tribe."
2740,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,She never told me.
2741,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yagoda,Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her.
2742,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?"
2743,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yagoda,I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.
2744,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Crew member,Good luck!
2745,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.
2746,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zuko,Good riddance to those traitors.
2747,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head. Or just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.
2748,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Oh,Careful with the blasting jelly!
2749,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zuko,"Uncle? Uncle, is that you?"
2750,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,Zuko! Zuko ...
2751,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Hi, Princess Yue. I made you something. I carved it myself."
2752,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,It's a bear.
2753,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Actually, it's supposed to be a fish. See, it has a fin."
2754,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,"Oh. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have asked you to come here."
2755,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,How's warrior training going?
2756,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,That bad?
2757,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost. So, how's waterbending training?"
2758,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.
2759,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Why don't you just teach her, Aang?"
2760,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"Why didn't I think of that? At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learn from Master Pakku! That way, you have someone to practice with, and I get to learn waterbending! Everyone's happy!"
2761,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,I'm not happy.
2762,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"But you're never happy. Come on, Aang."
2763,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.
2764,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,I got it!
2765,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,That was amazing!
2766,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,That wasn't me.
2767,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,I was just showing Katara a few moves.
2768,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture."
2769,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,"I'm sorry, I ..."
2770,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,You are no longer welcome as my student.
2771,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Arnook,What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?
2772,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,Yes ... please!
2773,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Arnook,"I suspect he might change his mind, if you swallow your pride and apologize to him."
2774,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,Fine.
2775,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"I'm waiting, little girl."
2776,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,No. No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!
2777,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,Uhhh ... Katara?
2778,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me.
2779,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,I'm sure she didn't mean that.
2780,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Yeah, I think she did."
2781,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. Just ... devastated.
2782,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.
2783,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,You know who was behind the attack?
2784,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,Yes ... pirates. We had a run-in with them a while back. They wanted revenge.
2785,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,"So, have you reconsidered my offer?"
2786,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,"Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!"
2787,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,To victory!
2788,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Are you crazy, Katara? You're not going to win this fight!"
2789,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,I know! I don't care!
2790,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.
2791,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy! So, you decided to show up? Aren't you going to fight?"
2792,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong. Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad? Study closely! Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you!"
2793,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,You can't knock me down!
2794,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,"Go, Katara!"
2795,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"Well, I'm impressed. You ''are'' an excellent waterbender."
2796,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"But you still won't teach me, will you?"
2797,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,No.
2798,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,This fight is over.
2799,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,Come back here. I'm not finished yet!
2800,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"Yes, you are. This is my necklace ..."
2801,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"No, it's not. It's mine! Give it back!"
2802,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,I made this sixty years ago for the love of my life ... for Kanna.
2803,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.
2804,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zuko,You didn't have to do this.
2805,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup.
2806,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zuko,"Thank you, Uncle."
2807,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Iroh,Someone's coming. Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours. Good luck.
2808,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her."
2809,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage."
2810,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,Go get her.
2811,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,What do you want from me?
2812,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me."
2813,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,You don't understand.
2814,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"No, no. See, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a Princess, and I'm ... I'm just a Southern peasant."
2815,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,"No, Sokka ..."
2816,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Sokka,"It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see you around, okay? Okay, now I'm really confused. ''Happy'', but confused."
2817,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Yue,"I do like you, a lot. But we can't be together, and not for the reason you think. It's because ... I'm engaged. I'm sorry."
2818,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,"Not bad, not bad. Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age."
2819,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,"Hey, Katara!"
2820,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Pakku,What do you think you're doing? It's past sunrise. You're late.
2821,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Aang,Good to see you here.
2822,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Katara,"You, too."
2823,1,The Waterbending Master,Water,1,18,Zhao,My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.
2824,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Pakku,"Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you've found time to play with house pets, you must have already mastered waterbending."
2825,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,"I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out."
2826,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?
2827,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.
2828,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,What's wrong? We're taking a walk!
2829,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,I'm engaged. It just feels ...
2830,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"I know what you need. You need to meet my good friend, Appa."
2831,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Who?
2832,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy? Ah, ah, easy! Down boy! Agh! No, up!"
2833,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention!
2834,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,"So, how does this work?"
2835,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"Yeah, we pretty much live up here."
2836,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Is it always this cold in the sky?
2837,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Not when you're with someone.
2838,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,It's beautiful up here.
2839,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"Yeah ... Woo, yeah! Ahhh, good times, good times. Hey, look!"
2840,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Oh no ...
2841,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Soot.
2842,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,What?
2843,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow."
2844,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,"But, why?"
2845,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"It's the Fire Nation. They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff, I'd say there's a lot of them."
2846,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zhao,"This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh. Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao, who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it."
2847,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,"Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects."
2848,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zhao,"I suppose you speak from experience, but rest assured. This will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se."
2849,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,"I hope not, for your sake."
2850,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zhao,Tell the captains to prepare for first strike.
2851,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?
2852,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,"I'm working on it, Uncle."
2853,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,What's wrong? We have to go!
2854,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,What? We're just friends.
2855,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,"I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you. I'm marrying someone else!"
2856,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him."
2857,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,But I do love my people.
2858,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,You're not marrying ''them.''
2859,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,"You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe. I have to do this. Goodbye."
2860,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,"The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep. It is with great sadness I call my family here before me, knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe, but they will never vanish from our hearts. Now, as we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits. Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us! I'm going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission."
2861,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Count me in!
2862,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,Sokka ...
2863,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,"Be warned, many of you will not return. Come forward to receive my mark, if you accept the task."
2864,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quiet dread.
2865,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. I'm going to make a difference this time.
2866,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,Yip-yip!
2867,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Katara!
2868,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,"I'll take it from here, boy."
2869,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,Appa!
2870,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,"Thanks for the rescue, buddy!"
2871,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,You've got to be kidding me ...
2872,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,"Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation Navy. That means you'll all need one of these uniforms."
2873,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Hahn,What's your problem?
2874,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.
2875,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Hahn,Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.
2876,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"When, like, a hundred years ago?"
2877,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,Eighty-five.
2878,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined.
2879,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Hahn,How do we know we can trust this guy? Such bold talk for a new recruit.
2880,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"His name is Zhao. Middle-aged, big sideburns, bigger temper ..."
2881,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,"Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn. He's leading this mission. Hahn, show Sokka your respect. I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law."
2882,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Hahn,"Yeah, what of it?"
2883,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Nothing. Congratulations.
2884,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Pakku,Stop those fireballs!
2885,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,"It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack. The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak."
2886,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zhao,"Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution. But for now, daybreak it is."
2887,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,They've stopped firing.
2888,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,Aang!
2889,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,I can't do it ... I can't do it.
2890,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,What happened?
2891,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,"I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all."
2892,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,"But, you have to. You're the Avatar."
2893,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,I'm just one kid.
2894,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,"If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape."
2895,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,"I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle."
2896,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,"I'm sorry. I just nag you, because ... well, ever since I lost my son ..."
2897,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,"Uncle, you don't have to say it."
2898,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,... I think of you as my own.
2899,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,"I know, Uncle. We'll meet again. After I have the Avatar."
2900,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,Remember your breath of fire. It could save your life out there.
2901,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,I will.
2902,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Iroh,And put your hood up. Keep your ears warm!
2903,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,I'll be fine!
2904,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Hahn,"Let me tell you Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls, but Yue is the finest and she comes with the most perks."
2905,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Perks? What does ''that'' mean?
2906,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Hahn,"I mean, Yue's nice and everything, but the points I'll gain with the chief aren't bad either."
2907,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!
2908,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Hahn,"Whoa, hang on. What do ''you'' care? You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life? No offense."
2909,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,"That's enough! Sokka, you're off the mission!"
2910,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Hahn,"All right, fall in men! Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Chō in no time!"
2911,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,It's Admiral ''Zhao''!
2912,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,Where are they going? They're coming up for air somewhere.
2913,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,The legends say the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves.
2914,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.
2915,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon. Our life comes from the spirit of the ocean. They work together to keep balance.
2916,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,The spirits! Maybe I can find them and get their help!
2917,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,How can you do that?
2918,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World! Aang can talk to them!
2919,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle!
2920,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,"The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?"
2921,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,I have an idea. Follow me.
2922,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,"So, is this the way to the Spirit World?"
2923,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,No. You'll have to get there on your own. But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole.
2924,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,I never thought I'd miss grass this much!
2925,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,It's so warm here! How is that possible?
2926,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land.
2927,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,"You're right, Yue. I can feel ... something. It's so tranquil."
2928,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,Be quiet!
2929,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,"Is something wrong, Sokka?"
2930,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"Oh, no. Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine."
2931,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons. I have a special task in mind for you.
2932,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,"What, you want me to scrub the barracks?"
2933,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Arnook,"I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue."
2934,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Oh ... Sure. That ... shouldn't be too hard.
2935,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Why is he sitting like that?
2936,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,"He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World. It takes all his concentration."
2937,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Is there any way we can help?
2938,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Aang,"How about some quiet? Come on guys, I can hear every word you're saying!"
2939,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Is he okay?
2940,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. That's his way back to the physical world.
2941,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Yue,Maybe we should get some help.
2942,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,"No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him."
2943,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,"Well, aren't you a big girl now."
2944,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,No ...
2945,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,Yes. Hand him over and I won't have to hurt you.
2946,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,"I see you've learned a new trick, but I didn't come this far to lose to you."
2947,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,"You little peasant. You've found a master, haven't you?"
2948,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zhao,It's daybreak at last. Let's write history.
2949,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zuko,You rise with the moon ... I rise with the sun.
2950,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Zhao,"The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable, but their city will fall today."
2951,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,Aang!
2952,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,What happened? Where's Zuko?
2953,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Katara,He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.
2954,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 1",Water,1,19,Sokka,Where did they go ...
2955,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,"You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back. Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine."
2956,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Katara,"Okay. It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back."
2957,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,"Yip, yip."
2958,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you. I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean Spirits.
2959,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Baboon spirit,Go. Away. You're still here?
2960,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"Yes, I need -"
2961,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Come back!
2962,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Roku,"Hello, Aang."
2963,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,Shelter.
2964,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"Roku, the Water Tribe's under attack. I need to find the Ocean and the Moon Spirits."
2965,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Roku,The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits. They crossed over the Spirit World to the mortal world very near the beginning. There is only one spirit I know of who is old enough to remember.
2966,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Who?
2967,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Roku,"The spirit's name is Koh, but he is very dangerous. They call him the Face Stealer. When you speak with him, you must be very careful to show no emotion at all. Not the slightest expression, or he will steal your face."
2968,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,"I finally have you, but I can't get you home because of this blizzard. There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything always came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy, and everyone adores her. My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck, though. I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am."
2969,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Iroh,"I don't need to remind you we have a time limit. If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises, they will be undefeatable."
2970,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,I assure you I have everything under control. I intend to remove the moon as a factor.
2971,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Iroh,Remove the moon? How?
2972,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Hahn,Admiral Choi! Prepare to meet your fate!
2973,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,"As I was saying, years ago I stumble upon a great and powerful secret: the identity of the Moon Spirit's mortal form."
2974,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Iroh,What?
2975,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,"I was a young lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom. I discovered a hidden library. Underground, in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll. One of them contained a detailed illustration, and the words ""moon"" and ""ocean"". I knew then that these spirits could be found and killed. And that it was my destiny to do so."
2976,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Iroh,"Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with!"
2977,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,"Yes, yes ... I know you fear the spirits, Iroh. I've heard rumors about your journey into the Spirit World. But the Ocean and Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world. And now they will face the consequences."
2978,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,You're just a curly tailed blue nose.
2979,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Aaahhh! Show no fear. Show no emotion at all.
2980,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Hello? I-I'm looking for a spirit named 'Koh'.
2981,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Koh,Welcome!
2982,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Thank you.
2983,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Koh,"My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time."
2984,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,You know me?
2985,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"I didn't know that. Why did he, or ''I'', try to kill you?"
2986,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,Guess we'll be here awhile.
2987,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,"Don't worry, Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather."
2988,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Katara,I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.
2989,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,"They're not going to die in this blizzard. If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive, and we'll find them."
2990,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Koh,It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection. So ... how may I help you?
2991,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,I need to find the moon and the ocean.
2992,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Koh,"Their spirit names are Tui and La, push and pull. And that has been the nature of their relationship for all time."
2993,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Please. Help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help.
2994,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?
2995,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Koh,"You've already met them, actually. Tui and La, your moon and ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other, push and pull, life and death, good and evil, yin and yang."
2996,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,The koi fish! I must be going now.
2997,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Koh,We'll meet again.
2998,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"The spirits are in trouble, I need to get back to the physical world."
2999,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Roku,"A friend is here, to guide you back."
3000,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,"We'll be following this map to a very special location. And when we get there, we're going fishing."
3001,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"This is where I came in, but how do I get back?"
3002,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Baboon spirit,Good riddance.
3003,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"Momo! Momo. Oh no, where's my body?"
3004,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Katara,"Look, that's gotta be Aang! Yip-yip!"
3005,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,Welcome back.
3006,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,It's good to be back.
3007,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,That won't be enough to escape.
3008,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Appa!
3009,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,Here for a rematch?
3010,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Katara,"Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match."
3011,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,"Hey, this is some quality rope!"
3012,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"Wait, we can't just leave him here."
3013,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,Sure we can. Let's go.
3014,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"No, if we leave him he'll die."
3015,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,"Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us."
3016,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,Are you okay?
3017,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,I feel faint.
3018,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"I feel it, too. The Moon Spirit is in trouble."
3019,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,I owe the Moon Spirit my life.
3020,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,What do you mean?
3021,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,"When I was born I was very sick and very weak. Most babies cry when they're born, but I was born as if I was asleep, my eyes closed. Our healers did everything they could. They told my mother and father I was going to die. My father pleaded with the spirits to save me. That night, beneath the full moon, he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond. My dark hair turned white. I opened my eyes and began to cry, and they knew I would live. That's why my mother named me Yue. For the moon."
3022,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,"I am ... a legend, now! The Fire Nation will, for generations, tell stories about the great Zhao, who darkened the moon. They will call me, Zhao the Conqueror, Zhao the Moon Slayer, Zhao the Invincible! Ugh ... Get it off! Get it off!"
3023,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,Don't bother.
3024,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"Zhao, don't!"
3025,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,"It's my destiny, to destroy the moon and the Water Tribe."
3026,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe. It will hurt everyone, including you. Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world."
3027,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Iroh,He is right Zhao.
3028,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,"There's no hope now, it's over."
3029,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,"No, it's not over."
3030,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,You're alive?
3031,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,You tried to have me killed!
3032,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,"Yes I did. You're the Blue Spirit, an enemy of the Fire Nation! You freed the Avatar."
3033,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,I had no choice.
3034,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Katara,"It's too late, it's dead."
3035,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Iroh,You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Some of its life is in you.
3036,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,"Yes, you're right. It gave me life, maybe I can give it back."
3037,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,No! You don't have to do that.
3038,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,"It's my duty, Sokka."
3039,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,I won't let you! Your father told me to protect you.
3040,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,I have to do this.
3041,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,"No! She's gone, she's gone."
3042,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Yue,"Goodbye, Sokka. I'll always be with you."
3043,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zhao,It can't be!
3044,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,Take my hand!
3045,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Pakku,I've decide to go to the South Pole. Some other benders and healers want to join me. It's time we helped rebuild our sister tribe.
3046,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Katara,What about Aang? He still needs to learn waterbending.
3047,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Pakku,"Well, then he better get used to calling you ''Master'' Katara."
3048,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Arnook,"The spirits gave me a vision when Yue was born. I saw a beautiful, brave, young woman become the Moon Spirit. I knew this day would come."
3049,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Sokka,You must be proud.
3050,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Arnook,So proud ... and sad.
3051,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Iroh,"I'm surprised Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar."
3052,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Zuko,I'm tired.
3053,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Iroh,Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.
3054,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Katara,"You too, Momo."
3055,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Aang,Come here.
3056,1,"The Siege of the North, Part 2",Water,1,20,Ozai,"Iroh is a traitor, and your brother Zuko is a failure. I have a task for you."
3057,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,Aang ...
3058,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,Do you want to talk about it?
3059,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Pakku,"Katara, I want you to have this. This amulet contains water from the Spirit Oasis. The water has unique properties. Don't lose it."
3060,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,"Thank you, Master Pakku."
3061,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Pakku,"Aang, these scrolls will help you master waterbending. But remember, they're no substitute for a real master. Sokka ... take care, son. Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom base to the east of here. General Fong will provide you with an escort to Omashu. There, you will be safe to begin your earthbending training with King Bumi."
3062,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"Appa, yip yip!"
3063,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,Say hi to Gran-Gran for me!
3064,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,"This is what I've been missing. Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water, and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense? I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it?"
3065,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,"Three years ago today, I was banished. I lost it all. I want it back. I want the Avatar, I want my honor, my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless."
3066,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,"My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord, and have brought shame on all of us. You might have mixed feelings about attacking members of the Royal Family. I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed."
3067,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,"Princess, I'm afraid the tides will not allow us to bring the ship into port before nightfall."
3068,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,"I'm sorry, captain, but I do not know much about the tides. Could you explain something to me?"
3069,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,"Of course, Your Highness."
3070,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,Do the tides command this ship?
3071,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,I'm afraid I don't understand.
3072,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,You said the tides would not allow us to bring the ship in. Do the tides command this ship?
3073,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,"No, princess."
3074,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,"And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore?"
3075,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,"No, princess."
3076,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,"Well then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who have already made up their mind about killing you, and worry more about me, who's still mulling it over."
3077,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,I'll pull us in.
3078,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,There it is!
3079,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"Welcome, Avatar Aang! I am General Fong, and welcome, to all of you great heroes! Appa, Momo, brave Sokka, the mighty Katara ..."
3080,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,Mighty Katara? I like that.
3081,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,"Not bad, not bad."
3082,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"Avatar Aang, we were all amazed at the stories of how you singlehandedly wiped out an entire Fire Navy fleet at the North Pole. I can't imagine what it feels like to wield such devastating power. It's an awesome responsibility."
3083,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,I try not to think about it too much.
3084,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"Avatar, you're ready to face the Fire Lord now."
3085,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,What? No I'm not!
3086,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,Aang still needs to master all four elements.
3087,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"Why? With the kind of power he possesses, power enough to destroy hundreds of battle ships in a matter of minutes, he could defeat the Fire Lord now!"
3088,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,"But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar State."
3089,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"See, it's this special state where-"
3090,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"I'm well aware! Your eyes and tattoos glow and you're able to summon unbelievable power. Without you, we'd be slaughtered before we even reach their shores. But with you leading the way, as the ultimate weapon, we could cut a swath right through to the heart of the Fire Nation."
3091,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there."
3092,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"So, it's decided then. I'll help you figure out how to get into the Avatar State and then you'll face your destiny."
3093,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"Well, while you take your time learning the elements, the War goes on. May I show you something? That's the infirmary, and those soldiers are the lucky ones. They came back. Every day, the Fire Nation takes lives. People are ''dying'', Aang! You could end it, ''now''. Think about it."
3094,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Lo,Almost perfect.
3095,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Li,One hair out of place.
3096,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,Almost isn't good enough!
3097,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,General Fong?
3098,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"Come in, Aang. Have you thought about our discussion?"
3099,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,I'm in. I'll fight the Fire Lord.
3100,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"I told the general I'd help him, by going into the Avatar State."
3101,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,"Aang, no! This is not the right way!"
3102,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? He was incredible!
3103,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,"There's a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline!"
3104,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord!
3105,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,"If you two meat heads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine, go ahead and glow it up!"
3106,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"Katara, I'm just being realistic! I don't have time to do this the right way!"
3107,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Soldier,"This rare chi-enhancing tea is a natural stimulant. In an ordinary warrior, it improves strength and energy ten-fold. In you, it may induce the Avatar State."
3108,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"Ten-fold energy, huh?"
3109,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,Is it working? Is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar State 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud?
3110,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death.
3111,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar State.
3112,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,I love surprises!
3113,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,Still not glowing.
3114,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Oracle,"You are wearing a ceremonial piece of clothing from each of the bending nations. Now I will join the four elements into one! Water , earth , fire , air! Four elements together as one!"
3115,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,This is just mud!
3116,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Oracle,So ... do you feel anything?
3117,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,We have to find a way.
3118,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,Look at these magnificent shells! I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.
3119,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,"We don't need any more useless things! You forget, we have to carry everything ourselves now!"
3120,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,What are you doing here?
3121,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,"In my country, we exchange a pleasant hello before asking questions. Have you become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?"
3122,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,Don't call me that!
3123,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,To what do we owe this honor?
3124,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,I'm sure your brother simply needs a moment.
3125,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,"Don't interrupt, Uncle! I still haven't heard my thank you. I'm ''not'' a messenger. I didn't have to come all this way."
3126,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,Father regrets? He ... wants me back?
3127,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,I can see you need time to take this in. I'll come to call on you tomorrow. Good evening.
3128,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,Can we talk about something?
3129,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,Sure.
3130,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,"Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore. I'm not saying the Avatar State doesn't have incredible and helpful power ... but you have to understand ... for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary."
3131,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this.
3132,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,I don't understand.
3133,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"No, you don't. Every day, more and more people die. I'm already one hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it!"
3134,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,I can't watch you do this to yourself. I'm not coming tomorrow. Good night.
3135,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,Good night.
3136,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,"We're going home! After three long years, it's unbelievable!"
3137,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,It ''is'' unbelievable. I have never known my brother to regret anything.
3138,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,Did you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him! He cares about me!
3139,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,"I care about you! And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine."
3140,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,You don't know how my father feels about me. You don't know anything!
3141,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,"Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem."
3142,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,"I think you are exactly what you seem! A lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man who's always been jealous of his brother!"
3143,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"Sokka! Sokka, wake up."
3144,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Huh?
3145,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar State.
3146,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,You sure?
3147,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,Yes.
3148,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Okay.
3149,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,Do you think the general will be mad?
3150,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you?
3151,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,Wait! Don't leave without me!
3152,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,Uncle! You've changed your mind!
3153,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,"Family sticks together, right?"
3154,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,We're finally going home!
3155,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,"The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So I guess that's it."
3156,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,You sure I can't change your mind?
3157,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar State when I'm in genuine danger.
3158,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,I see. I was afraid you'd say that.
3159,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Aang!
3160,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,Men! Attack the Avatar!
3161,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,What are you doing?
3162,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,I believe we're about to get results.
3163,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,I'm not your enemy! I won't fight you!
3164,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,You can't run forever!
3165,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,You can't fight forever!
3166,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,Brother! Uncle! Welcome! I'm so glad you decided to come.
3167,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,"Are we ready to depart, Your Highness?"
3168,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,"Set our course for home, captain."
3169,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,Home.
3170,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,You heard the princess! Raise the anchors! We're taking the prisoners home!
3171,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Captain,"Your Highness, I ..."
3172,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Zuko,You lied to me!
3173,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,Like I've never done that before.
3174,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,I wonder what crazy thing they're trying to do now. Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay.
3175,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,What's going on?
3176,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,The general's gone crazy! He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar State!
3177,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Good ... bird ... horse thingy ...
3178,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,Maybe you can avoid me ... but she can't.
3179,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,I can't move!
3180,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Katara! No!
3181,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,Stop this! You have to let her go!
3182,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,You could save her if you were in the Avatar State!
3183,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,I'm trying ... I'm trying!
3184,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,"Aang, I'm sinking!"
3185,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,Please!
3186,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,You don't need to do this!
3187,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,"Apparently, I do."
3188,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,It worked! It worked!
3189,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Azula,"You know, Father blames Uncle for the loss of the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar! Why would he want ''you ''back home, except to lock you up where you can no longer embarrass him?"
3190,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Roku,It's time you learned.
3191,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Roku,"The Avatar State is a defense mechanism, designed to empower you with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars."
3192,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Roku,"The glow is the combination of all your past lives, focusing their energy through your body."
3193,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,What do you mean?
3194,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,Ha! Are you joking? That was almost perfect! We just have to find out a way to control you when you're like that.
3195,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Aang,You're out of your mind.
3196,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Fong,I guess we'll figure it out on the way to the Fire Nation.
3197,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Sokka,Anybody got a problem with that?
3198,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Soldier,Do you still want an escort to Omashu?
3199,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Katara,I think we're all set.
3200,1,The Avatar State,Earth,2,21,Iroh,I think we're safe here.
3201,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"You guys are going to be done soon, right? We have a lot of ground to cover if we're going to make it to Omashu today."
3202,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"I could be ready in two minutes. Seriously, whenever."
3203,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,So you were showing me the octopus form?
3204,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Right, let me see your stance."
3205,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Your arms are too far apart. See, if you move them closer together, you protect your center. You got it?"
3206,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"Oh, yea ... thanks."
3207,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Okay, let's see what you got."
3208,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang."
3209,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Da, da, da. Don't fall in love with the traveling girl. She'll leave you broke and brokenhearted. Hey, river people!"
3210,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,We're not river people.
3211,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,You're not? Well then what kind of people are you?
3212,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,Just ... people.
3213,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Aren't we all, brother?"
3214,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,Who are you?
3215,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"I'm Chong and this is my wife, Lily. We're nomads, happy to go wherever the wind takes us!"
3216,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,You guys are nomads? That's great! I'm a nomad!
3217,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Hey, me too!"
3218,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,I know ... you just said that.
3219,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,Oh. Nice underwear ...
3220,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,"I didn't find anything to eat! I can't live like this! I wasn't meant to be a fugitive. This is impossible! Uncle, what are you doing?"
3221,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,"You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking. That, or it's the white jade, which is poisonous."
3222,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,"We need food, not tea. I'm going fishing."
3223,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,Hmm ... delectable tea? Or deadly poison?
3224,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere!"
3225,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Well not everywhere, Little Arrowhead. But where we haven't been, we've heard about through stories and songs."
3226,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler!
3227,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me."
3228,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows."
3229,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Wow, sounds like someone has a case of destination fever. You're worried too much about where you're going."
3230,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Lily,"You got to focus less on the ""where"" and more on the ""going""."
3231,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,O. Ma. Shu!
3232,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi, so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe."
3233,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,Sounds like you're headed to Omashu.
3234,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,There's an old story about a secret pass right through the mountains.
3235,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,Is this real or a legend?
3236,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself. Two lovers, forbidden from one another, the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be together! Yeah, I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes ... Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountains, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!"
3237,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine.
3238,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground. And we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable ..."
3239,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Commander,Launch!
3240,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Team Avatar,Ahhhh!
3241,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"Secret love cave, let's go."
3242,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,"Zuko, remember that plant I thought might be tea?"
3243,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,You didn't ...
3244,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,I did ... and it wasn't.
3245,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,Ahh!
3246,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,"When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing. But look what I found. These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade. That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness."
3247,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help.
3248,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,But where are we going to go? We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation.
3249,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,"If the Earth Kingdom discovers us, they'll have us killed."
3250,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,"But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula."
3251,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,Earth Kingdom it is.
3252,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,How far are we from the tunnel?
3253,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Actually, it's not just one tunnel. The lovers didn't want anyone to find out about their love, so they built a whole labyrinth!"
3254,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Oh, I'm sure we'll figure it out."
3255,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Lily,All you need to do is trust in love ... according to the curse.
3256,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,Curse!
3257,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,Hey-hey! We're here!
3258,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,What exactly is this curse?
3259,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise, you'll be trapped in them forever."
3260,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Lily,And die.
3261,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Oh yeah, and die. Hey, I just remembered the rest of that song! And die!"
3262,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,That's it! There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!
3263,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Moku,"Hey, someone's making a big campfire!"
3264,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"That's no campfire, Moku."
3265,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,It's Fire Nation. They're tracking us.
3266,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,So all you need to do is trust in love to get through these caves?
3267,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"That is correct, Master Arrowhead."
3268,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,We can make it.
3269,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Commander,Hold on! It's too dangerous. Haven't you heard the song? Just close them in. The mountain will take care of the rest.
3270,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. I hope."
3271,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?"
3272,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Uh, about two hours each."
3273,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Lily,"And we have five torches, so that's ten hours!"
3274,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!
3275,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Lily,"Oh, right."
3276,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.
3277,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,"You two must not be from around here. We know better than to touch the White Jade, much less make it into tea and drink it."
3278,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,Whoops!
3279,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,So where are you traveling from?
3280,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,Do you have names?
3281,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,"Names? Of course we have names. I'm, uh ... Lee and this is my Uncle, uh ... Mushi?"
3282,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,"Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior."
3283,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,"Mushi and Junior, huh. My name is Song. You two look like you could use a good meal. Why don't you stay for dinner?"
3284,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,"Sorry, but we need to be moving on."
3285,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,That's too bad. My mom always makes too much roast duck.
3286,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,Where do you live exactly?
3287,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to."
3288,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,This doesn't make sense. We already came through this way.
3289,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,We don't need a map. We just need love. The little guy knows it.
3290,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map also."
3291,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,There's something strange here. There's only one explanation. The tunnels are changing.
3292,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song's mother,My daughter tells me you're refugees. We were once refugees ourselves.
3293,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,"When I was a little girl, the Fire Nation raided our farming village. All the men were taken away. That was the last time I saw my father."
3294,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,I haven't seen my father in many years.
3295,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,"Oh, is he fighting in the War?"
3296,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,Yeah.
3297,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"The tunnels, they're a-changin'. It must be the curse! I knew we shouldn't have come down here!"
3298,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"Right, if only we listened to you."
3299,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,Everyone be quiet. Listen.
3300,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,It's a giant flying thing with teeth!
3301,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Moku,No! It's a wolfbat!
3302,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Yeah, it's no use. We're separated. But at least you have us!"
3303,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,Nooooo!
3304,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,Can I join you? I know what you've been through. We've all been through it. The Fire Nation has hurt you.
3305,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,"It's okay. They've hurt me, too."
3306,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Oh, don't let the cave-in get you down! Don't let the falling rocks turn your smile into a frown! When the tunnels are darkest, that's when you need a clown, hey! Don't let the cave-in get you down, Sokka!"
3307,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Aang, look!"
3308,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,We found the exit!
3309,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,This isn't the exit.
3310,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,No. It's a tomb.
3311,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,These pictures tell their story.
3312,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ...
3313,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ... but their love was strong and they found a way."
3314,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly. Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth. But, one day, the man didn't come - he'd died in the war between the two villages. Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ... but, instead, she declared the war over. Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace. The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love."
3315,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,Love is brightest in the dark.
3316,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Moku,"Oh, great! Your plans have led us to ''another'' dead end!"
3317,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"At least I'm ''thinking'' of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku."
3318,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Well, then listen to this: If love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song!"
3319,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,How are we going to find our way out of these tunnels?
3320,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,I have a crazy idea.
3321,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,What?
3322,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,Never mind. It's too crazy.
3323,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"Katara, what is it?"
3324,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ...
3325,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,Right ...
3326,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"And here, it says, ""Love is brightest in the dark,"" and has a picture of them kissing."
3327,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,Where are you going with this?
3328,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Well, what if we ... kissed?"
3329,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,See? It was a crazy idea.
3330,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,Us ... ''kissing'' ...
3331,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,Yeah. I definitely wouldn't want to kiss ''you''!
3332,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Oh, well! I didn't realize it was'' such'' a ''horrible'' option. Sorry I suggested it!"
3333,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"No, no, I mean ... if there was a choice between kissing you and ''dying'' ..."
3334,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,Ugh!
3335,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,What? I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment.
3336,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,"Well, I'm not sure ''which'' I'd rather do!"
3337,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,What is ''wrong'' with me ...
3338,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart ..."
3339,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,Thank you for the duck. It was excellent.
3340,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song's mother,You're welcome. It brings me pleasure to see someone eat my cooking with such ... gusto.
3341,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,Much practice.
3342,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,"Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people."
3343,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,Thank you.
3344,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Song,"I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The Avatar has returned."
3345,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,I know.
3346,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Iroh,What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness.
3347,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Zuko,They're about to show us a little more kindness. Well?
3348,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we?"
3349,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,I think so ...
3350,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"Then, what are we going to do?"
3351,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,What ''can'' we do?
3352,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Hey! You saved us, Sokka!"
3353,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"No, they were trying to get away from something!"
3354,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,From what?
3355,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Hey, those things are music lovers!"
3356,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"Badgermoles coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out!"
3357,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"The big, bad badgermoles who earthbend the tunnels, hate the wolfbats, but love the sounds!"
3358,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,They're made of some kind of crystal. They must only light up in the dark.
3359,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,That's how the two lovers found each other. They just put out their lights and followed the crystals. That must be the way out!
3360,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"So, uh ..."
3361,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,Let's go!
3362,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,What about Sokka?
3363,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,Sokka!
3364,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,How did you guys get out?
3365,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way."
3366,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way."
3367,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Katara,Why is your forehead all red?
3368,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you: I think that kid might be the Avatar!
3369,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,So are you guys going to come to Omashu with us?
3370,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Moku,Nope.
3371,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Aang,"Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku."
3372,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey."
3373,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,Just play your songs.
3374,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Chong,"Hey! Good plan! Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart. Da, da, da ..."
3375,1,The Cave of Two Lovers,Earth,2,22,Sokka,"The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about: the destination. I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O- Oh no ..."
3376,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Up until now it was. Now Ba Sing Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.
3377,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"No, I'm going in to find Bumi."
3378,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,"Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still ..."
3379,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,What? If he's still what?
3380,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,A-around.
3381,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,"I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people who can teach you earthbending."
3382,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend.
3383,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,A secret passage? Why didn't we just use this last time?
3384,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Ugh!
3385,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,That answer your question?
3386,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Eww!
3387,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,That wasn't as bad as I thought.
3388,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Ahh! They won't let go! Help!
3389,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Guard one,Hey! What are you kids doing out past curfew?
3390,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,Sorry. We were just on our way home.
3391,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Guard one,"Wait, what's the matter with him?"
3392,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,"Uh, he has pentapox, sir. Umm, it's highly contagious."
3393,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,"Oh, it's so awful. I'm dying."
3394,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,And deadly.
3395,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Guard two,"Hey, I think I heard of pentapox! Didn't your cousin Chang die of it?"
3396,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Guard one,"We'd better go wash our hands, and burn our clothes."
3397,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"Thank you, sewer friends."
3398,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Li,"When tracking your brother and uncle, traveling with the royal procession may no longer be an option."
3399,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Lo,May no longer be wise.
3400,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Lo and Li,If you hope to keep the element of surprise.
3401,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"You're right. The Royal Procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile, nimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends."
3402,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,Let's find Bumi and get out of here.
3403,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Where would they be keeping him?
3404,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,Somewhere he can't earthbend. Somewhere made of metal.
3405,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.
3406,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Michi,"Mai, your father was appointed governor. We're like royalty here. Be happy and enjoy it."
3407,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Resistance fighter,The targets are approaching.
3408,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,Take them out.
3409,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,"I thought my life was boring in the Fire Nation, but this place is unbearably bleak. Nothing ever happens."
3410,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Michi,The resistance!
3411,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"Ty Lee, could that possibly be you?"
3412,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,Azula!
3413,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,It is so good to see you!
3414,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"Please, don't let me interrupt your ... whatever it is you were doing."
3415,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"Tell me, what is the daughter of a nobleman doing here? Certainly our parents didn't send us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls to end up in ... places like this."
3416,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,I have a proposition for you.
3417,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"I'm hunting a traitor. You remember my old fuddy-duddy uncle, don't you?"
3418,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,Oh yeah. He was so funny.
3419,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,I would be honored if you would join me on my mission.
3420,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,"Oh ... I ... uh ... would love to. But the truth is, I'm really happy here. I mean, my aura has never been pinker!"
3421,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"I'll take your word for it. Well, I wouldn't want you to give up the life you love just to please me."
3422,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,"Thank you, Azula."
3423,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"Of course, before I leave, I'm going to catch your show."
3424,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,Uh ... yeah ... sure ... uh ... of course ...
3425,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance?"
3426,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,"Of course not! The day of the invasion, we readied ourselves for battle. We were prepared to defend our city ... to fight for our lives and for our freedom. But before we even had a chance, King Bumi surrendered."
3427,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,"The day of the invasion, I asked King Bumi what he wanted to do. He looked me in the eye and said ..."
3428,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,I'm going to do ... nothing!
3429,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,It doesn't matter now. Fighting the Fire Nation is the only path to freedom. And freedom is worth dying for.
3430,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation. But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day."
3431,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,"You don't understand. They've taken our home, and we have to fight them at any cost!"
3432,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,Fine. But there's thousands of citizens that need to leave. How're we going to get them all out?
3433,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Suckers!
3434,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.
3435,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,"The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta act sick too. Ya gotta sell it!"
3436,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
3437,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Old man,Years of practice.
3438,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Okay everyone! Into sick formation.
3439,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,"Aang, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us?"
3440,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi.
3441,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later."
3442,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Soldier,Plague! Plague!
3443,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ukano,What is going on down there?
3444,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Guard,I saw some kids yesterday who were sick with pentapox. It must have spread!
3445,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ukano,"Pentapox! Hmm, I'm pretty sure I've heard of that."
3446,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Michi,"Oh, this is terrible."
3447,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Guard,What should we do?
3448,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ukano,Drive them out of the city ... but don't touch them! We have to rid the city of this disease!
3449,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,"Fire flakes, Dad?"
3450,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Michi,How awful!
3451,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,Flopsie!
3452,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"Come on, Flopsie. You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! Oh ... I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!"
3453,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Shuzumu,We're deeply honored to have the Fire Lord's daughter at our humble circus.
3454,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Shuzumu,Uh ... tell us if there is anything we can do to make the show more enjoyable.
3455,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,I will.
3456,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,Incredible. Do you think she'll fall?
3457,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Shuzumu,Of course not.
3458,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,Then wouldn't it make it more interesting if you removed the net?
3459,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Shuzumu,Uh ... the thing is ... the performers ...
3460,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"You're right, you're right. That's been done. I know. Set the net on fire."
3461,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Shuzumu,"Of course, Princess."
3462,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"Brilliant, just brilliant! Ooh, what kind of dangerous animals do you have?"
3463,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Shuzumu,"Well, our circus boasts the most exotic assortment-"
3464,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,Release them all!
3465,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,We looked everywhere. No Bumi.
3466,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,We've got a problem. We just did a head count.
3467,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,Oh no. Did someone get left behind?
3468,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,"No, we have an extra."
3469,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ukano,"So, the resistance has kidnapped my son. Everything so clever, so tricky. Just like their King Bumi."
3470,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Guard,"What do you want to do, sir?"
3471,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,What an exquisite performance. I can't wait to see how you'll top yourself tomorrow.
3472,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,"I'm sorry Azula, but unfortunately there won't be a show tomorrow."
3473,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,Really?
3474,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,The universe has given me strong hints that it's time for a career change. I want to join you on your mission.
3475,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,No! Bad Fire Nation baby!
3476,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Oh ... all right.
3477,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,"Oooh, you're so cute. Mmmmm ..."
3478,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,"Sure he's cute now, but when he's older, he'll join the Fire Nation army. You won't think he's so cute then. He'll be a killer."
3479,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,Does that look like the face of a killer to you?
3480,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Yung,A messenger hawk!
3481,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,It's from the Fire Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son. So ... he wants to make a trade. His son for King Bumi.
3482,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,You realize we're probably walking right into a trap.
3483,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,I don't think so. I'm sure the governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi. It's a new day. I have a good feeling about this.
3484,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,Please tell me you're here to kill me.
3485,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"It's great to see you, Mai."
3486,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,I thought you ran off and joined the circus. You said it was your calling.
3487,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,"Well, Azula called a little louder."
3488,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,I have a mission and I need you both.
3489,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,Count me in. Anything to get me out of this place.
3490,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ukano,I apologize. You've come to Omashu at a difficult time. At noon we're making a trade with the resistance to get Tom-Tom back.
3491,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"Yes, I'm so sorry to hear about your son, but really, what did you expect by just letting all the citizens leave? My father has trusted you with this city and you're making a mess of things!"
3492,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ukano,"Forgive me, Princess."
3493,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"You stay here. Mai will handle the hostage trade so you don't have a chance to mess it up. And there is no more ""Omashu"". I'm renaming it in honor of my father, the city of New Ozai."
3494,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Hi, everybody!"
3495,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,You brought my brother?
3496,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,He's here. We're ready to trade.
3497,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"I'm sorry, but a thought just occurred to me. Do you mind?"
3498,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,"Of course not, Princess Azula."
3499,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"We're trading a two year old for a king. A powerful, earthbending king?"
3500,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,Mmm hmmm!
3501,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,"It just doesn't seem like a fair trade, does it?"
3502,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,You're right. The deal's off.
3503,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,Whhhoa! See you all later!
3504,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,Bumi!
3505,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,The Avatar!
3506,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,My lucky day.
3507,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Aang, is that you? Where did you come from?"
3508,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,Hang on! We're gonna get you out of here.
3509,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,We've got to get the baby out of here!
3510,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,Way ahead of ya!
3511,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Aang, stop your blowing for a minute."
3512,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,Now hold on just a duahhh!!!
3513,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"It's just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?"
3514,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Aang, I need to talk to you!"
3515,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,It's good to see you too!
3516,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,How are you gonna fight without your bending?
3517,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,I seem to manage!
3518,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Katara,There's Aang!
3519,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Sokka,We can catch him!
3520,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here!"
3521,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,You could earthbend? All along?
3522,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Well, they didn't cover my face."
3523,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi?"
3524,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Listen to me, Aang. There are options in fighting, called jing. It's a choice of how you direct your energy."
3525,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"I know! There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating."
3526,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,... and neutral jing when you do nothing!
3527,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,There are ''three'' jings?
3528,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Well, technically there are eighty-five, but let's just focus on the third. Neutral jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike."
3529,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"That's why you surrendered, isn't it?"
3530,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Yes, and it's why I can't leave now."
3531,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.
3532,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jing. You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking.
3533,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Aang,"Hey, Momo!"
3534,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,Momo's mastered a few jings himself!
3535,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,King Bumi,"Goodbye, Aang. I'll see you when the time is right."
3536,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Mai,"So, we're tracking down your brother and Uncle, huh?"
3537,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Ty Lee,"It'll be interesting seeing Zuko again, won't it, Mai?"
3538,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Azula,It's not just Zuko and Iroh anymore. We have a third target now.
3539,1,Return to Omashu,Earth,2,23,Michi,Tom-Tom!
3540,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Iroh,Spare coins for weary travelers?
3541,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Zuko,This is humiliating! We're royalty! These people should be giving us whatever we want.
3542,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Peasant girl,"Aw, here you go."
3543,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Iroh,"The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile!"
3544,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Broadsword man,How about some entertainment in exchange for ... a gold piece?
3545,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Zuko,We're ''not'' performers.
3546,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Iroh,"Not professional anyway. It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty!"
3547,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Broadsword man,"Come on, we're talking a ''gold'' piece here! Let's see some action! Dance!"
3548,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Iroh,They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se!
3549,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Broadsword man,"Ha, ha! Nothing like a fat man dancing for his dinner! Here ya go!"
3550,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Hey, you taking us down for a reason? Aang, why are we going down?"
3551,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,What? I didn't even notice.
3552,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Are you noticing now?
3553,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,Is something wrong?
3554,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me."
3555,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Is it telling you where we can get something to eat?
3556,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"No, I ... I think it wants us to land there."
3557,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on."
3558,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"I don't know. Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?"
3559,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Yes.
3560,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,I don't know. There's something ominous about that place.
3561,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here."
3562,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this, bye swamp. Yip, Yip!"
3563,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"You better throw in an extra ""yip""! We gotta move!"
3564,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Where's Appa and Momo? Appa! Momo!
3565,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,"Sokka, you've got an elbow leech."
3566,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Where? Where?
3567,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Why do things keep attaching to me?!
3568,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,You couldn't find them?
3569,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"No, and the tornado ... it just disappeared."
3570,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,We better speed things up.
3571,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Maybe we should be a little nicer to the swamp.
3572,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Aang, these are just plants. Do you want me to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" as I swing my machete back and forth?"
3573,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels ... ''alive.''
3574,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can."
3575,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,Appa! Momo!
3576,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night.
3577,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,What was that?
3578,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Nothing, just swamp gas. Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here."
3579,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,I think we should build a fire.
3580,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"Sokka, the longer we're here, the more I think you shouldn't be doing do that."
3581,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine. Right, swamp? ""No problem, Sokka!"""
3582,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?
3583,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Please, we're all alone out here."
3584,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Except for them.
3585,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Right, except for them."
3586,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Guys?
3587,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,"What'd you reckon make a track like that, Tho?"
3588,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,"Don't know, Due. Some'in with six legs. Pretty big'uns too."
3589,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,"Leaves a nice, wide trail to folla'."
3590,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,You know what's at the end of that trail?
3591,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,Dinner.
3592,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,Aang! Sokka!
3593,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,Hello? Hello? Can you help me? Mom? Mom!
3594,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,I can't believe ...
3595,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Aang! Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines! Katara! You think you're so tough, huh?"
3596,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Hello? Yue? This is just a trick of the light ... swamp gas ... I ... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy.
3597,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Princess Yue,You didn't protect me.
3598,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Katara! Appa!
3599,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Hello? Who are you?
3600,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"Hey, come back!"
3601,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,Look at that Tho. Is that a little hairy fella ridin' that thing?
3602,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,"No, that's what they call a ""lemoo"". Saw one at a traveling show once. Real smart they say."
3603,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,Bet he tastes a lot like possum chicken.
3604,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,You think everything tastes like possum chicken.
3605,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,"C'mon now, fellas. Just a little closer. Nice and easy. Nothing to worry about. We just fixin' to eat ya."
3606,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,What'd you say that fer?
3607,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,"Well, we are!"
3608,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,But you don't have to tell 'em that.
3609,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,Well how'd I know they'd understand me?
3610,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,Come on!
3611,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Who are you?
3612,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,What do you guys think you're doing!? I've been looking all over for you!
3613,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,"Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!"
3614,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,I was chasing some girl.
3615,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,What girl?
3616,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress.
3617,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!"
3618,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,I thought I saw Mom.
3619,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here."
3620,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,You saw something too?
3621,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything. Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot."
3622,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here.
3623,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,Okay ... so where's here? The middle of the swamp?
3624,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"Yeah, the center ... it's the heart of the swamp. It's been calling us here. I knew it."
3625,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"It's just a tree. It can't call anyone. For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here."
3626,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,"Now, what would a lemoo need a shirt fer?"
3627,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,There's someone in there! He's bending the vines!
3628,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us!?
3629,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,Wait! I didn't call you here.
3630,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land."
3631,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us a lot.
3632,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,The Avatar? Come with me.
3633,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,"So, who are you then?"
3634,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,"I protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it, like this fella with his big knife."
3635,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"See, completely reasonable. Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home. Nothing mystical about it."
3636,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,"Oh the swamp is a mystical place all right. It's sacred. I reached enlightenment right here under the banyan-grove tree. I heard it calling me, just like you did."
3637,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Sure you did. It seems real chatty.
3638,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,"See this whole swamp is actually just one tree spread out over miles. Branches spread and sink, take root, and spread some more. One big, living organism. Just like the entire world."
3639,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"I get how the tree is one big thing, but the whole world?"
3640,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,"Sure. You think you're any different from me or your friends or this tree? If you listen hard enough, you can hear every living thing breathing together. You can feel everything growing. We're all living together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots and we are all branches of the same tree."
3641,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,But what did our visions mean?
3642,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,"In the swamp, we see visions of people we've lost, people we loved, folks we think are gone. But the swamp tells us they're not. We're still connected to them. Time is an illusion and so is death."
3643,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,But what about my vision? It was someone I had never met.
3644,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,You're the Avatar. You tell me.
3645,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,"Time is an illusion. So, it's someone I will meet."
3646,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to find Appa and Momo."
3647,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,I think I know how to find them. Everything is connected. Come on! We've got to hurry!
3648,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,Set my lines by the river bed! Caught ten fish and I killed 'em dead! Cut 'em and gut 'em and I tossed the heads in the water to keep them catgators fed.
3649,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,Appa!
3650,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,We're under attack!
3651,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,"Hey, you guys are waterbenders!"
3652,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,You too! That means we're kin! Hey Huu! How you been?
3653,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,"You know, scared some folks, swung some vines, the usual."
3654,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Huu?
3655,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,How you like that possum chicken?
3656,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Tastes just like arctic hen. So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa? You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.
3657,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,You want me to eat old Slim? He's like a member of the family!
3658,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,Nice Slim!
3659,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Due,"Oh, he don't eat no bugs! That's people food."
3660,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,Where'd you say you was from?
3661,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,The South Pole.
3662,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,"Didn't know there was waterbenders anywhere but here. They got a nice swamp there, do they?"
3663,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,"No, it's all ice and snow."
3664,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Tho,Hmm. No wonder you left.
3665,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here. Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp."
3666,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Katara,What about the visions?
3667,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!"
3668,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Aang,But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?
3669,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count. The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down."
3670,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Huu,I can't do anything like that. I just bend the water in the plants.
3671,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Sokka,"Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp."
3672,1,The Swamp,Earth,2,24,Broadsword man,Who's there?
3673,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"What are you doing in my mouth? Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries."
3674,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Mongke,Give up! You're completely surrounded!
3675,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,Come on! Come on! Come on!
3676,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,My scrolls!
3677,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,My staff!
3678,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,Yip yip!
3679,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"Wait, my boomerang!"
3680,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,There's no time!
3681,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"Oh, I see, so there's time to get your scrolls and time to get your staff, but no time for my boomerang?"
3682,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,That's correct!
3683,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,Oh.
3684,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka."
3685,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"I feel like I've lost part of my identity. Imagine if you lost your arrow, or Katara lost her ... hair loopies."
3686,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Merchant,"Here's your produce, ponytail guy."
3687,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,I used to be boomerang guy ...
3688,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Merchant,"Hey, Water Tribe money!"
3689,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,I hope that's okay.
3690,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Merchant,So long as it's money. Have a nice Avatar Day!
3691,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,Avatar Day?
3692,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Merchant,"You guys are going to the festival, right?"
3693,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew?
3694,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float!
3695,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,And here comes Avatar Roku!
3696,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated."
3697,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food!
3698,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Aang, look!"
3699,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,That's the biggest me I've ever seen!
3700,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"Now a torch, that's a nice prop. It's bright, dangerous ... smells manly. But I'm not sure I could carry it off."
3701,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Hey, what's that guy doing?"
3702,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Villagers,Down with the Avatar!
3703,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Iroh,Where did you get these?
3704,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Zuko,What does it matter where they came from?
3705,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Iroh,Mmmm ... ... mmmm!
3706,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Villager,That party pooper's ruining Avatar Day!
3707,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,That party pooper's my friend!
3708,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,It's the Avatar himself!
3709,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Villager,It's going to kill us with its awesome Avatar powers!
3710,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"No, I'm not, I ..."
3711,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,"I suggest you leave! You're not welcome here, Avatar!"
3712,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,Why not? Aang helps people.
3713,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,It's true! I'm on your side.
3714,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,You think that I ... murdered someone?
3715,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,Huh!
3716,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would. And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!
3717,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,Give me a chance to clear my name!
3718,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,The only way to prove your innocence is to stand trial.
3719,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,I'll gladly stand trial!
3720,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,You'll have to follow all our rules. That includes paying bail.
3721,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,No problem.
3722,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?
3723,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"So some people don't like you, big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here!"
3724,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,I can't.
3725,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,Sure you can! A little swish-swish-swish! Airbending slice! And we're on our way!
3726,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"I think what ""Master Swish"" is trying to say is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here."
3727,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence.
3728,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.
3729,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective."
3730,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"Well, I guess I could be classified as such."
3731,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky."
3732,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots! See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. Okay, I guess I am pretty good."
3733,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"So, you'll help me with my case?"
3734,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,Fine! But I'm going to need some new props. I'm ready. What?
3735,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,"This is the crime scene. This is the footprint of the killer, Kyoshi. It was at sunset, 370 years ago today, that she emerged from the temple, and struck down Chin the Great. After that tragic day, we built this statue to immortalize our great leader. Feel free to appreciate it."
3736,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.
3737,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,Shhh! I wanna solve it! That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple!
3738,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"That's a big hole in the mayor's story, but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence."
3739,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,You're right. We need to go to Kyoshi Island.
3740,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,Where did you get that?
3741,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Scary prisoner,You got a bald head. Some nice tattoos. You're going to fit in real well around here.
3742,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Koko,Where's Aangy?
3743,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"He couldn't be here, Koko."
3744,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Koko,I wanted to see Aangy ...
3745,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,Oyaji! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life.
3746,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,They say it was Kyoshi.
3747,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine. Maybe something there will help you clear her name.
3748,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"So, uh ... what's Suki up to? Is she around?"
3749,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,"Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war. You kids had a big impact on Suki. She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world."
3750,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"Oh, well ... that's great."
3751,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,This temple was converted into a shrine to Kyoshi. The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono.
3752,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,She had exquisite taste.
3753,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,Please don't touch!
3754,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"These fans ... They were her weapons, no?"
3755,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,Also refrain from touching the fans.
3756,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!
3757,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,The biggest of any Avatar.
3758,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you?
3759,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,You're right. I'm sorry. Please.
3760,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,Aha! There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint. And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene.
3761,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Brilliant, Sokka."
3762,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Scary prisoner,This girl you're talking about? She'll come around. You just gotta hang in there.
3763,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,You think so?
3764,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Scary prisoner,Sure.
3765,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sensitive ruffian,You're a catch.
3766,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,I don't know ...
3767,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Scary prisoner,"Hey! You're smart, handsome, funny. Not to mention you're the Avatar."
3768,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,You guys are great.
3769,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sensitive ruffian,Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel.
3770,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,"This piece is called ""The Birth of Kyoshi"". It was painted at sunrise on this day this island was founded. Why, it was today in fact, three hundred and seventy years ago."
3771,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"Three hundred and seventy years? Wait, are you sure it was today?"
3772,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,"Oh, seeing how it's Kyoshi Day, yes, I'm sure."
3773,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise. It took place at sun''set''. Look at the shadows.
3774,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,They point east. So the sun must have been in the west.
3775,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Oyaji,So what?
3776,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. She has an alibi!"
3777,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Honorable Mayor, we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence."
3778,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,Evidence? Hmph! That's not how our court system works.
3779,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,Then how can I prove my innocence?
3780,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,"Simple. I say what happened , then you say what happened, and then I decide who's right. That's why we call it justice. Because it's ""just us."""
3781,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,"Everyone loved Chin the Great because he was so great. Then the Avatar showed up and killed him, and that's how it happened."
3782,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Guard,The accused will now present its argument.
3783,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,"You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence."
3784,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,Right ... evidence. Ladies and gentlemen ... I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one. Uhhh ...
3785,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,The footprint!
3786,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"Oh, yeah. You see ... I have very large feet. Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue. But ... I was in a painting at sunset. So, there you have it, I'm not guilty."
3787,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,He's dead.
3788,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Iroh,Looks like you did some serious shopping. But where did you get the money?
3789,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Zuko,Do you like your new teapot?
3790,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Iroh,"To be honest with you , the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup. I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty."
3791,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Zuko,There's no honor for me without the Avatar.
3792,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Iroh,"Zuko ... Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now."
3793,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Zuko,Then there is no hope at all.
3794,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Iroh,"No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength."
3795,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony."
3796,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,"I've already told you, it's just me and the accused. You can't call any witnesses!"
3797,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call ... Avatar Kyoshi herself!
3798,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,What are you doing?
3799,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something."
3800,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,I do believe in the power of stuff.
3801,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,This is a mockery of Chin Law!
3802,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here!"
3803,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"Hey, everybody! Avatar Kyoshi here."
3804,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Kyoshi,"I killed Chin the Conqueror. A horrible tyrant, Chin was expanding his army to all corners of the continent."
3805,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Kyoshi,"When they came to the neck of the peninsula where we lived, he demanded our immediate surrender. I warned him that I would not sit passively while he took our home. But he did not back down."
3806,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Kyoshi,"On that day, we split from the mainland."
3807,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Kyoshi,I created Kyoshi Island so my people could be safe from invaders.
3808,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"So, what just happened?"
3809,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,Uhhh ... you kind of confessed. Sorry.
3810,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,And I find you ... Guilty! Bring out the Wheel of Punishment!
3811,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Zuko,Uncle ... I thought a lot about what you said.
3812,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Iroh,"You did? Good, good."
3813,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Zuko,It's helped me realize something. We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together. I need to find my own way.
3814,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Iroh,Wait!
3815,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Guard,The accused will now spin the Wheel of Punishment to determine his sentence.
3816,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"I said I would face justice, so I will."
3817,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Villager,"Come on, torture machine!"
3818,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,Community service! Please stop on community service!
3819,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Guard,"Looks like it's ""boiled in oil."""
3820,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Mongke,We've come to claim this village for the Fire Lord! Now show me your leader so I may ... dethrone him!
3821,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Villager,That's him over there!
3822,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,"Ahhh! You, Avatar, do something!"
3823,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Aang,"Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil."
3824,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,"There, community service! Now serve our community and get rid of those rhinos!"
3825,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Mongke,"Rough Rhinos, to the town!"
3826,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,Boomerang! You do always come back!
3827,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,"From now on, we'll celebrate a new Avatar Day in honor of the day Avatar Aang saved us from the Rough Rhino Invasion."
3828,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,What is this?
3829,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Tong,That's our new festival food! Un-fried dough. May we eat it and be reminded of how on this day the Avatar was not boiled in oil.
3830,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Katara,"Happy Avatar Day, everyone!"
3831,1,Avatar Day,Earth,2,25,Sokka,This is by far the worst town we've ever been to.
3832,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,It's pricey ... but I really do like it.
3833,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"Then you should get it, you deserve something nice."
3834,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,"I do, don't I? But no, it's too expensive. I shouldn't."
3835,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"All right, then don't."
3836,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,You know what? I'm gonna get it.
3837,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Flyer distribution man,"Psst, psst! Hey, you kids love earthbending? You like ... throwing rocks? Then check out Master Yu's Earthbending Academy."
3838,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Look! There's a coupon on the back! The first lesson is free.
3839,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,Who knows? This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for.
3840,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Yu,"Take your stances! Now, strike as if you're punching through your opponent's head!"
3841,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Yu,"So, are you ready to commit to more lessons? If you pay for the whole year in advance, I'll bump you up to the next belt!"
3842,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Ehhh, he's not the one."
3843,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Male student,I think The Boulder's going to win back the belt at Earth Rumble VI.
3844,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Excuse me, but where is this earthbending tournament, exactly?"
3845,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Male student,"It's on the island of Noneya ... ""Noneya"" business!"
3846,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,"Oh, I got to remember that one!"
3847,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"I'll take care of this. Hey, strong guys! Wait up!"
3848,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,What was I thinking? I don't need a new bag! Why did you let me buy this?
3849,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,You ready to find an earthbending teacher? Because we're going to Earth Rumble VI!
3850,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,How'd you get them to tell you?
3851,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,Oh ... a girl has her ways.
3852,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here."
3853,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,I guess that's why.
3854,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,"Welcome to Earth Rumble VI! I am your host, Xin Fu!"
3855,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"This is just going to be a bunch of guys chucking rocks at each other, isn't it?"
3856,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,That's what I paid for.
3857,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,"The rules are simple. Just knock the other guy out of the ring, and you win! Round one: The Boulder vs. The Big Bad Hippo!"
3858,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,The Boulder,"Listen up, Hippo. You may be big, but you ain't bad! The Boulder's gonna win this in a landslide!"
3859,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,The Hippo,Hippo ... mad!
3860,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,"Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! The Hippo is rocking the boat!"
3861,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,The Boulder wins!
3862,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves.
3863,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka?"
3864,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Go back to the Fire Nation!
3865,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Fire Nation Man,"No, no, please!"
3866,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Yeah! Wooo! The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt! Yeah! Woohoo!
3867,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,I think she is.
3868,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,The Boulder,The Boulder feels conflicted about fighting a young blind girl.
3869,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder!"
3870,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,The Boulder,"The Boulder's over his conflicted feelings, and now he's ready to bury you screen in a rock-alanche!"
3871,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Whenever you're ready, The Pebble!"
3872,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,The Boulder,It's on!
3873,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,The Boulder,Ooooooh!
3874,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,"Your winner, and still the champion, the Blind Bandit!"
3875,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,How did she do that?
3876,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,She waited ... and listened.
3877,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,"To make things a little more interesting, I'm offering up this sack of gold pieces to anyone who can defeat the Blind Bandit! What? No one dares to face her?"
3878,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,I will!
3879,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder!
3880,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,Do people really want to see ''two'' little girls fighting out here?
3881,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Audience,Oooh.
3882,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you.
3883,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Boo! No talking!
3884,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,Don't boo at him!
3885,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,Somebody's a little light on his feet! What's your fighting name: the Fancy Dancer? Where'd you go?
3886,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Please, wait!"
3887,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,There you are!
3888,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Please, listen! I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you!"
3889,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Whoever you are, just leave me alone."
3890,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Wait!
3891,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,"Way to go, champ!"
3892,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,"I've got to admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag. It matches the belt, perfectly."
3893,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,That is a big relief.
3894,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"If we want to find the Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a great place to start."
3895,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Male student,"Oh great, you again."
3896,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"Yeah, I didn't think so."
3897,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Nicely done.
3898,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Male student,Hey! You're that kid who beat the Blind Bandit!
3899,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives?
3900,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Male student,"The Blind Bandit's a mystery. She shows up to fight, then disappears."
3901,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl, in a white dress, with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that?"
3902,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Male student,"Well, a flying boar is the symbol of the Beifong family. They're the richest people in town. Probably the whole world."
3903,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,A flying boar is good enough for me. Let's check it out.
3904,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Male student,"Yeah, you better leave."
3905,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"Hey, I got my eye on you."
3906,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Water Tribe.
3907,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,The Boulder,"I'm telling you, The Boulder was standing right there. I saw the kid strike, but there was no earthbending. Nothing made contact. The Blind Bandit just fell out of the ring. She must've took a dive and split the money with the kid."
3908,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,That's the flying boar from my vision. Come on!
3909,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"What are you doing here, Twinkle Toes?!"
3910,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,How did you know it was me?
3911,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,"Don't answer to Twinkle Toes, it's not manly!"
3912,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,You're the one whose bag matches his belt.
3913,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,How did you find me?
3914,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth. And then I had a vision in a magic swamp, and -"
3915,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar. And if he doesn't master earthbending soon, he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord."
3916,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Not my problem. Now, get out of here, or I'll call the guards."
3917,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,"Look, we all have to do our part to win this war, and yours is to teach Aang earthbending."
3918,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Guards! Guards, help!"
3919,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Guard,"Toph, what happened?"
3920,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,I ... thought I heard someone. I got scared.
3921,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Guard,"You know your father doesn't want you wandering the grounds without supervision, Toph."
3922,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,I'm pleased to hear that Toph's private lessons are going well. But I want to be sure she's not trying anything too dangerous.
3923,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Yu,Absolutely not. I am keeping her at a beginner's level. Basic forms and breathing exercises only.
3924,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,Very good.
3925,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Servant,"Excuse me, sir, but you have a visitor."
3926,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,Who thinks they are so important they can just come to my home unannounced?
3927,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Servant,"Uh ... the Avatar, sir."
3928,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,Blow on it. It's too hot for her.
3929,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Allow me.
3930,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Poppy,"Avatar Aang, it's an honor to have you visit us."
3931,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,"In your opinion, how much longer do think the war will last?"
3932,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first."
3933,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,"Well, Master Yu is the finest teacher in the land. He's been teaching Toph since she was little."
3934,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Then she must be a great earthbender! Probably good enough to teach someone else! Ow!
3935,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Yu,Toph is still learning the basics.
3936,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,"Yes, and sadly, because of her blindness, I don't think she will ever become a true master."
3937,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is."
3938,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,What's your problem?!
3939,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,What's ''your'' problem?
3940,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Poppy,"Well, shall we move to the living room for dessert, then?"
3941,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Good night, buddy."
3942,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Relax. Look, I'm sorry about dinner. Let's call a truce, okay? Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing. I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet. I feel the vibrations in the Earth, and I can see where everything is. You, that tree ... even those ants."
3943,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,That's amazing.
3944,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless.
3945,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Is that why you became the Blind Bandit?
3946,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,Yeah.
3947,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Then why stay here where you're not happy?
3948,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,They're my parents. Where else am I supposed to go?
3949,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,You could come with us.
3950,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Yeah. You guys get to go wherever you want. No one telling you what to do, that's the life. It's just not my life. We're being ambushed!"
3951,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,I think you kids owe me some money.
3952,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Whoever took Aang and Toph left this.
3953,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"""If you want to see your daughter again, bring five hundred gold pieces to the arena."" It's signed Xin Fu and The Boulder."
3954,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,"Master Yu, I need you to help me get my daughter back."
3955,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,We're going with you.
3956,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Poppy,"Poor Toph, she must be so scared ..."
3957,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,You think you're so tough? Why don't you come up here so I can snap that grin off your face?
3958,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,I'm not smiling.
3959,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,Toph!
3960,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Here's your money. Now let them go.
3961,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,What about Aang?
3962,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Xin Fu,"I think the Fire Nation will pay a hefty price for the Avatar. Now, get out of my ring."
3963,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"Go, I'll be okay."
3964,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"Toph, there's too many of them. We need an earthbender. We need you!"
3965,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,My daughter is blind. She is blind and tiny and helpless and fragile. She cannot help you!
3966,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Yes, I can."
3967,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,Let him go! I beat you all before and I'll do it again!
3968,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,The Boulder,The Boulder takes issue with that comment.
3969,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Hit it harder!
3970,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,I'm trying!
3971,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Yu,I never knew. Your daughter's amazing!
3972,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Yu,She's the greatest earthbender I've ever seen.
3973,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Dad, I know it's probably hard for you to see me this way. But the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me. I love fighting. I love being an earthbender, and I'm really, really good at it. I know I've kept my life secret from you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world. You were doing it to protect me, but I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend. So, now that you see who I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me."
3974,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,"Of course it doesn't change the way I feel about you, Toph. It's made me realize something."
3975,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,It has?
3976,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,Yes. I've let you had far too much freedom. From now on you'll be cared for and guarded twenty-four hours a day.
3977,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"But, Dad!"
3978,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Poppy,"We're doing this for your own good, Toph."
3979,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,Please escort the Avatar and his friends out. They are no longer welcome here.
3980,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"I'm sorry, Toph."
3981,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"I'm sorry too. Goodbye, Aang."
3982,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Katara,"Don't worry, we'll find you a teacher. There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there."
3983,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Not like her.
3984,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Toph! What are you doing here?
3985,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world.
3986,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,"Well, we'd better get out of here, before your dad changes his mind again."
3987,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,Good idea.
3988,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,"You're going to be a great teacher, Toph."
3989,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Speaking of which, I want to show you something."
3990,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Aang,Okay.
3991,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,"Now we're even. Um, I'll take the belt back."
3992,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Toph,Ow!
3993,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Sokka,Sorry.
3994,1,The Blind Bandit,Earth,2,26,Lao,I know you two are very different. But I believe you have a common interest. The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter. I want you to do whatever it takes to bring her home.
3995,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Earth Kingdom soldier,"Come on, spidersnake eyes! Ha! Ha! Yeah!"
3996,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,"Could I get some water, a bag of feed and something hot to eat?"
3997,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Store owner,Not enough here for a hot meal. I can get you ''two'' bags of feed.
3998,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Earth Kingdom soldier,Ow!
3999,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,"Hey! You throwing eggs at us, stranger?"
4000,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,No.
4001,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,You see who did throw it?
4002,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,No.
4003,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Earth Kingdom soldier,"That your favorite word, no?"
4004,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,Egg had to come from somewhere.
4005,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,Maybe a chicken flew over.
4006,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,"Thanks for your contribution. The army appreciates your support. You better leave town. Penalty for stayin's a lot steeper than you can afford, stranger. Trust me."
4007,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Store owner,Those soldiers are supposed to protect us from the Fire Nation. But they're just a bunch of thugs.
4008,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Thanks for not ratting me out!
4009,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,"I'll take you to my house and feed your ostrich horse for you. Come on, I owe you!"
4010,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,No one can ever sneak up on us.
4011,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,No kidding.
4012,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gansu,You a friend of Lee's?
4013,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,"This guy just stood up to the soldiers! By the end, he practically had them running away!"
4014,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Sela,Does this guy have a name?
4015,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,I'm ... uh ...
4016,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gansu,"He doesn't have to say who he is if he doesn't want to, Sela. Anyone who can hold his own against those bully soldiers is welcome here. Those men should be ashamed to wear Earth Kingdom uniforms."
4017,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Sela,"The real soldiers are off fighting the War, like Lee's big brother Sensu. Supper's going to be ready soon. Would you like to stay?"
4018,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,I can't. I should be moving on.
4019,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Sela,"Gansu could use some help on the barn. Why don't you two work for a while, and then we'll eat."
4020,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,You don't seem like you're from around here.
4021,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,Mm-mm.
4022,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Where are you from then?
4023,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,Far away.
4024,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Ohhh. Where are you going?
4025,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gansu,"Lee, give it a rest. Stop asking the man personal questions, got it?"
4026,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Yes. So how'd you get that scar?
4027,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gansu,It's not nice to bother people about things they might not want to talk about. A man's past is his business.
4028,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,"Hey Mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks?"
4029,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,Zuko! Why would you do that?
4030,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Ow! Ow ow! Ouch!
4031,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Stupid turtle duck. Why she'd do that?
4032,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"Zuko. That's what moms are like. If you mess with their babies,, they're gonna bite you back!"
4033,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Ty Lee,Ugh! Azula!
4034,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,Watch this! Mom! Can you make Zuko play with us? We need equal teams to play a game!
4035,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,I am ''not'' cart-wheeling.
4036,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"You won't have to. Cart-wheeling's not a game, dum-dum."
4037,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,I don't care. I don't want to play with you!
4038,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"We ''are'' brother and sister. It's important for us to spend time together! Don't you think so, Mom?"
4039,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"Yes, darling, I think it's a good idea to play with your sister. Go on now, just for a little while."
4040,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"Here's the way it goes. Now what you do is, try to knock the apple off the other person's head, like this."
4041,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"See, I told you it would work!"
4042,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Ty Lee,"Aww, they're so cute together!"
4043,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Mai,You two are such ... ugh!
4044,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,I was just coming to get you. Uncle Iroh sent us a letter from the war-front. You're soaking wet?
4045,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Girls are crazy!
4046,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Iroh,"If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold. I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first!"
4047,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"Until then, enjoy these gifts."
4048,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"For Zuko, a pearl dagger from the general who surrendered when we broke through the Outer Wall. Note the inscription and the superior craftsmanship."
4049,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Never give up without a fight.
4050,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"And for Azula, a new friend. She wears the latest fashion for Earth Kingdom girls."
4051,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"If Uncle doesn't make it back from war, then Dad will be next in line for Fire Lord, wouldn't he?"
4052,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"Azula, we don't speak that way. It would be awful if Uncle Iroh didn't return. And besides, Fire Lord Azulon is a picture of health."
4053,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted Dad to die?
4054,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord than His Royal Tea-Loving Kookiness.
4055,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,You're holding them wrong.
4056,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,"Keep in mind, these are dual swords. Two halves of a single weapon. Don't think of them as separate, 'cause they're not. They're just two different parts of the same whole."
4057,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,I think you'd really like my brother Sensu. He used to show me stuff like this all the time.
4058,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Sela,Here. This ought to get you through a few meals.
4059,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gansu,What do you think they want?
4060,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,Trouble.
4061,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gansu,"What do you want, Gow?"
4062,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,Just thought someone ought to tell you that your son's battalion got captured. You boys hear what the Fire Nation did with their last group of Earth Kingdom prisoners?
4063,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Earth Kingdom soldier,"Dressed 'em up in Fire Nation uniforms and put 'em on the front line unarmed, the way I heard it. Then they just watched."
4064,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gansu,You watch your mouth!
4065,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,Why bother rooting around in the mud with these pigs?
4066,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,Iroh has lost his son. Your cousin Lu Ten did not survive the battle.
4067,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,What's going to happen to my brother?
4068,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gansu,I'm going to the front. I'm going to find Sensu and bring him back.
4069,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,When my dad goes ... will you stay?
4070,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,No. I need to move on.
4071,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,Here. I want you to have this. Read the inscription.
4072,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Made in Earth Kingdom.
4073,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,The other one.
4074,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Never give up without a fight.
4075,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,You waste all your time playing with knives. You're not even good!
4076,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Put an apple on your head and we'll find out how good I am!
4077,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"By the way, Uncle's coming home."
4078,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Does that mean ... we won the War?
4079,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"No, it means Uncle's a quitter ''and'' a loser."
4080,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,What are you talking about? Uncle's ''not'' a quitter!
4081,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"Oh yes he is! He found out his son died and he just fell apart! A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying."
4082,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,How do you know what he should do? He's probably just sad his only kid is gone. Forever.
4083,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"Your father has requested an audience with Fire Lord Azulon. Best clothes, hurry up!"
4084,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,Fire Lord Azulon ... can't you just call him 'Grandfather'? He's not exactly the powerful Fire Lord he used to be. Someone will probably end up taking his place soon.
4085,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,Young lady! Not another word!
4086,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,What is wrong with that child?
4087,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ozai,And how was it Great-Grandfather Sozin managed to win the Battle of Han Tui?
4088,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Great-Grandfather won ... because ...
4089,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"Because even though his army was outnumbered, he cleverly calculated his advantages. The enemy was downwind and there was a drought. Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes."
4090,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ozai,"Correct, my dear. Now, would you show Grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to me?"
4091,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ozai,She's a true prodigy! Just like her grandfather for whom she's named.
4092,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,You'll never catch up ...
4093,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,I'd like to demonstrate what I've been learning.
4094,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,I failed.
4095,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"No. I loved watching you. That's who you are, Zuko. Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard."
4096,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Azulon,"Prince Ozai, why are you wasting my time with this pomp? Just tell me what you want. Everyone else, go!"
4097,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,What are you -?
4098,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,Shh!
4099,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ozai,"Father, you must have realized as I have, that with Lu Ten gone, Iroh's bloodline has ended. After his son's death, my brother abandoned the siege at Ba Sing Se, and who knows when he will return home. But I am here, Father, and my children are alive."
4100,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Azulon,Say what it is you want!
4101,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ozai,"Father, revoke Iroh's birthright. I am your humble servant, here to serve you and our nation. Use me."
4102,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Azulon,You dare suggest I betray Iroh? My first born? Directly after the demise of his only beloved son? I think Iroh has suffered enough! But you ... your punishment has scarcely begun!
4103,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"Dad's going to kill you! Really, he is."
4104,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,"Ha-ha, Azula. Nice try."
4105,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"Fine, don't believe me. But I heard everything. Grandfather said Dad's punishment should fit his crime. ""You must know the pain of losing a first-born son. By sacrificing your own!"""
4106,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Liar!
4107,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,I'm only telling you for your own good. I know! Maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you!
4108,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Stop it! You're lying! Dad would never do that to me!
4109,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,Your father would never do what to you? What is going on here?
4110,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,I don't know ...
4111,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,It's time for a talk!
4112,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Azula always lies. Azula always lies.
4113,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,Azula always lies.
4114,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,I'll get your son back.
4115,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Hey! There he is! I told you he'd come!
4116,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,Let the kid go.
4117,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,"Who do you think you are, telling us what to do?"
4118,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,Are you gonna let this stranger stand there and insult you like this?
4119,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Old man,Give him a left! A left!
4120,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Old woman,It's not a fistfight ...
4121,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Old man,"He's got a left sword, don't he?"
4122,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Old man,Look out!
4123,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Behind you!
4124,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,... Mom?
4125,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect you."
4126,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Ursa,"Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are."
4127,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,Get up ...!
4128,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Gow,Who ... who are you?
4129,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,"My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Prince of the Fire Nation, and heir to the throne."
4130,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Old man,"Liar! I heard of you! You're not a prince, you're an outcast! His own father burned and disowned him!"
4131,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Sela,Not a step closer.
4132,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Zuko,It's yours. You should have it.
4133,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Lee,No! I hate you!
4134,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Mom? Mom? Mom!
4135,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Where's Mom?
4136,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,"No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away."
4137,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,"Not funny, Azula! You're sick. And I want my knife back, now."
4138,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Azula,Who's going to make me? ''Mom?''
4139,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Young Zuko,Where is she?
4140,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Fire Sage,"Azulon. Fire Lord to our nation for twenty-three years. You were our fearless leader in the Battle of Garsai. Our matchless conqueror of the Hu Xin Provinces. You were father of Iroh, father of Ozai, husband of Ilah, now passed. Grandfather of Lu Ten, now passed. Grandfather of Zuko, and Azula. We lay you to rest."
4141,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Fire Sage,"As was your dying wish, you are now succeeded by your second son."
4142,1,Zuko Alone,Earth,2,27,Fire Sage,Hail Fire Lord Ozai!
4143,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,Hey! You guys picked a great campsite. The grass is so soft.
4144,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,That's not grass. Appa's shedding.
4145,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Oh, gross!"
4146,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"That's not gross, it's just a part of spring! You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat."
4147,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Ah, the beauty of spring."
4148,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Stop! Appa, stop! Ugh!"
4149,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"It's not that bad, Katara. It makes a great wig!"
4150,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,And a great beard!
4151,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group, because you two are disgusting."
4152,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Excuse me, does anyone have a razor? Because I've got some hairy pits!"
4153,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"So Toph, usually when setting up camp, we try to divide up the work."
4154,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Hey, don't worry about me. I'm good to go."
4155,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Well, actually what I'm trying to say is, some of us might fetch water, while someone else might set up the fire pit, or put up the tent. Even Momo does his fair share."
4156,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire, I've already collected my own food and look, my tent's all set up."
4157,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish -"
4158,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,I don't understand what's the problem here!
4159,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,Never mind.
4160,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,Sorry!
4161,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each other's nerves."
4162,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Yeah, you ''do'' seem pretty tired."
4163,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,I meant all of us.
4164,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Well, good night."
4165,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,Good night.
4166,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,There's something coming toward us!
4167,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,What is it?
4168,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"It feels like an avalanche, but also ''not'' an avalanche."
4169,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,Your powers of perception are frightening.
4170,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,Should we leave?
4171,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,Better safe than sorry.
4172,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,What is that thing?
4173,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Ah, land sweet land! See you guys in the morning!"
4174,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Actually, can you help us unload?"
4175,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,Really? You need ''me'' to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?
4176,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Well, yeah. That and everything else. You're a part of our team now, and -"
4177,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,Look! I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff! I'm carrying my own weight.
4178,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"That's not the point. Ever since you joined us, you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful!"
4179,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"What? Look here, sugar queen, I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending. So don't you talk to me about being selfish!"
4180,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"''""Sugar queen""''?! D-did you just slam the door in my face?! How can you be so infuriating?!"
4181,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,Should we do something?
4182,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Hey, I'm just enjoying the show."
4183,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"Okay, okay, you both need to calm down."
4184,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"""Both""?! ''I'm completely calm!!''"
4185,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,I ... can see that.
4186,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"The stars sure are beautiful tonight. Too bad you can't see them, Toph!"
4187,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,That thing is back!
4188,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"I don't think so, Sokka."
4189,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Seriously, what is that thing?"
4190,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,And how does it keep finding us?
4191,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Okay, forget about setting up camp. I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep."
4192,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,It could be Zuko. We haven't seem him since the North Pole.
4193,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,Who's Zuko?
4194,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world."
4195,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"What's wrong with ponytails, Ponytail?"
4196,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,This is a warrior's wolf tail.
4197,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky."
4198,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh?"
4199,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"No Momo, shhh. Sleepy time."
4200,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Oh, don't tell me ..."
4201,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us.
4202,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,I can feel it with my own two feet!
4203,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,Let's get out of here.
4204,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly."
4205,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,Always the optimist ...
4206,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,It's those three girls from Omashu!
4207,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,We can take them. Three on three.
4208,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Actually Toph, there's four of us."
4209,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all."
4210,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,I can still fight!
4211,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Okay, three on three plus Sokka."
4212,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,Errrgh!
4213,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"Appa, yip yip!"
4214,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu.
4215,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,I still think we could have taken them.
4216,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Are you kidding me? The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary."
4217,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Oh no, the sun is rising. We've been up all night with no sleep!"
4218,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"Sokka, we'll be okay."
4219,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Every time we land, those girls are there. So we'll just have to keep flying."
4220,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,We can't keep flying forever.
4221,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,So what's our plan?
4222,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,Don't know ... too tired to think.
4223,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap.
4224,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,Yes ... sleep.
4225,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,What's going on?
4226,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,Appa fell asleep!
4227,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"Wake up, buddy!"
4228,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,Appa's exhausted.
4229,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them. The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep."
4230,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Of course, we could've gotten some sleep earlier, if Toph didn't have such issues."
4231,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"All right, all right, everyone's exhausted! Let's just get some rest."
4232,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"No, I want to hear what Katara has to say. You think I have issues?"
4233,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"I'm just saying. Maybe if you helped out earlier, we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!"
4234,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,You're blaming me for this?
4235,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"No! No, she's not blaming you."
4236,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"No, I'm blaming her!"
4237,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Hey, I never asked you for diddly-doo-dah. I carry my own weight. Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's Sheddy over here!"
4238,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,What? You're blaming Appa?
4239,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Yeah, you want to know how they keep finding us? He's leaving a trail everywhere we go!"
4240,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not. He is! Appa's carrying your weight. He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us!"
4241,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,I'm out of here.
4242,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,Wait!
4243,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,What did I just do? I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone.
4244,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other. And I was so mean to her.
4245,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks."
4246,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Thanks, Sokka."
4247,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,No problem.
4248,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,We need to find Toph and apologize.
4249,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?"
4250,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,I have a plan.
4251,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"Toph was right. The fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail."
4252,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,Are you sure he's okay to fly?
4253,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here. I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off-course.
4254,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,Ow ... That really hurt my tailbone.
4255,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Ty Lee,"Hmmm ... they're not wads, they're more like bundles, or bunches? It's got an ""uh"" sound."
4256,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Mai,Clumps?
4257,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Ty Lee,Clumps! They're clumps!
4258,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Mai,The trail goes this way.
4259,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Azula,The Avatar's trying to give us the slip. You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison. I'll follow this trail.
4260,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Toph couldn't have made it too far. What is it, Momo? Ooooh, no! Katara!"
4261,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Appa, come on, we need to go faster!"
4262,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,He's too tired!
4263,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Come on Appa, just a little further ..."
4264,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,We made it! We're safe.
4265,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,You did it Appa!
4266,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Good try, but no."
4267,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,How are you doing?
4268,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Well, you know ..."
4269,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Mai,"I thought when Ty Lee and I finally caught you guys, it would be more exciting. Oh well, victory is boring."
4270,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Sokka,"Thanks Appa, I don't know what we'd do without you."
4271,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Ty Lee,"Was it just me, or was that guy kind of cute?"
4272,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"All right, you've caught up with me. Now, who are you and what do you want?"
4273,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,So what now?
4274,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Azula,"Now? Now, it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go. You can run, but I'll catch you."
4275,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,I'm not running.
4276,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,Here is your tea. You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.
4277,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,You seem a little too old.
4278,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,Perhaps I am.
4279,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,I know what you're thinking ... I look like I can't handle being by myself.
4280,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,I wasn't thinking that.
4281,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea!
4282,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason.
4283,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me, but I can take care of myself, by myself."
4284,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,"You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. Not that I love you, I just met you."
4285,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,So where is your nephew?
4286,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,I've been tracking him actually.
4287,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,Is he lost?
4288,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,So now you're following him.
4289,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,"I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there."
4290,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it. Thank you."
4291,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.
4292,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"No, thank you for what you said. It helped me."
4293,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,I'm glad.
4294,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,"Oh, and about your nephew, maybe you should tell him that you need him, too."
4295,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Azula,Do you really want to fight me?
4296,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Zuko,"Yes, I really do."
4297,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,Zuko!
4298,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Azula,"I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu."
4299,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,"""Zuzu""?"
4300,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Zuko,"Back off, Azula! He's mine!"
4301,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Azula,I'm not going anywhere.
4302,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Aang,Katara!
4303,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Zuko,Uncle ...
4304,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Iroh,Get up!
4305,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Toph,I thought you guys could use a little help.
4306,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,Thanks.
4307,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Azula,"Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors, all working together. I'm done. I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor."
4308,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Zuko,Aaaah!
4309,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Zuko,Ugggh! Get away from us!
4310,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Katara,"Zuko, I can help."
4311,1,The Chase,Earth,2,28,Zuko,Leave!
4312,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Today's the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! And this place, it's perfect, don't you think? Sokka? Oh, you're still sleeping, huh? Sorry."
4313,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Goooood morning, earthbending student!"
4314,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Good morning, Sifu Toph."
4315,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Well, if you think I should ..."
4316,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Sorry, Snoozles, we'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can."
4317,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"So what move are you going to teach me first? Rock-a-lanche? The Trembler? Oh, maybe I could learn to make a whirlpool out of land!"
4318,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,Let's start with ... move a rock.
4319,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Sounds good, sounds good!"
4320,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"The key to earthbending is your stance. You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element. If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself."
4321,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,Like a rock. Got it.
4322,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple. Okay, you ready to give it a try?"
4323,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I'm ready.
4324,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,Rock beats airbender!
4325,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Lu Ten,"I got you, Dad!"
4326,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again."
4327,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,Uncle ... you were unconscious. Azula did this to you. It was a surprise attack.
4328,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Somehow, that's not so surprising."
4329,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,I hope I made it the way you like it.
4330,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,Good. That was very ... uhhh ... bracing.
4331,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,"So Uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her."
4332,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down. It's time to resume your training."
4333,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did.
4334,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle?
4335,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"No. That's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickety-trick that's going to move that rock. You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this ..."
4336,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,Whoa!
4337,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,"I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction."
4338,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,Rock-like!
4339,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,Rock-like!
4340,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat. Just a bit closer ... Gotcha! You are one lucky little meat creature."
4341,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind."
4342,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,"I see. That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind."
4343,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes. There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning."
4344,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,I'm ready to try it!
4345,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first."
4346,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you. If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. Like this!"
4347,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,"Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?"
4348,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"I'm glad you said something. Actually there is a better way. This way, you'll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara."
4349,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Yeah, thanks, Katara!"
4350,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,Heh.
4351,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.
4352,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"There's nothing to say, you blew it! You had a perfect stance, and a perfect form. But when it came right down to it, you didn't have the guts!"
4353,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I know. I'm sorry.
4354,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Yeah, you ''are'' sorry! If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?"
4355,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"No, I don't think I do."
4356,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,"Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on. Okay?"
4357,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Yeah, that sounds good."
4358,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better."
4359,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face ... like everything always does.
4360,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.
4361,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,What turmoil?
4362,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away."
4363,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,But I don't feel any shame at all. I'm as proud as ever.
4364,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame."
4365,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,"Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately."
4366,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself."
4367,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute. Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty. Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay, I got it. Now, come back boomerang."
4368,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,"You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?"
4369,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I don't want to talk about it.
4370,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"I know, I know, I know, I know! I get it, all right? I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't, but I can't."
4371,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,"Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?"
4372,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I guess it's earth.
4373,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,That's why it's so difficult for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast! Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.
4374,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Thanks, Katara. ''Sifu'' Katara."
4375,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything."
4376,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,Why are you telling me these things?
4377,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole."
4378,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.
4379,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful, too. You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders."
4380,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Aang, I found these nuts in your bag. I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it."
4381,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have."
4382,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"You know, I'm really glad you feel that way. Because I also have this great new nutcracker."
4383,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ... It's a delicate instrument!"
4384,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,It's not the only delicate instrument around here.
4385,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,'''Aang''',Ohm.
4386,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,Meditating here!
4387,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.
4388,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,We'll find him faster if we split up.
4389,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? Ow! That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal? Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat?"
4390,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,Sokka! Are you okay?
4391,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!"
4392,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,Hmmm ... I bet I can airbend you out of here.
4393,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?"
4394,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I can't ... I can't do it.
4395,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph."
4396,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I can't do that either.
4397,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,You can't? Why not?
4398,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,It would just be really ... uncomfortable.
4399,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Uncomfortable? Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ..."
4400,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Thanks, Sokka. This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position."
4401,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Awkward position, I think I know the feeling."
4402,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place."
4403,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Hmmm ... how about that. Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang."
4404,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub."
4405,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,Really? He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion.
4406,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. What are you doing out here little guy? Did you lose your mama?
4407,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning."
4408,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,You can teach me to redirect lightning?
4409,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean. From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this. Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?"
4410,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,I think so.
4411,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Come on, you've got to feel the flow. Excellent! You've got it!"
4412,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,"Great, I'm ready to try it with real lightning!"
4413,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous!"
4414,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,I thought that was the point! You teaching me to protect myself from it!
4415,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Iroh,"Yeah! But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all!"
4416,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,"Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning."
4417,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Hey there, we found your cub! See, we have no problem with you! We're friendly!"
4418,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here!"
4419,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"This is really bad! Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!"
4420,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Oh no! Woo-hoo, look at me!"
4421,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Please, don't leave me again."
4422,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I won't.
4423,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,What are you doing here?
4424,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,Just enjoying the show.
4425,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,What? You were there the whole time?
4426,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,Pretty much.
4427,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could have gotten him out and helped us get away!
4428,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,Guess it just didn't occur to me.
4429,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,Enough! I want my staff back!
4430,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,Do it now!
4431,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,What?
4432,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Earthbend, Twinkle Toes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast. And even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got stuff."
4433,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,Do it!
4434,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,You did it! You're an earthbender.
4435,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,I can't believe it!
4436,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?"
4437,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"No problem, Sokka!"
4438,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him."
4439,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Sokka,"Yeah, no crushing, please."
4440,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,You found him!
4441,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Hey Katara, look what I can do!"
4442,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Katara,"You did it! I knew you would! You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?"
4443,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Toph,"Yep, it worked wonders."
4444,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Aang,"Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable!"
4445,1,Bitter Work,Earth,2,29,Zuko,"You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back! Come on, strike me! You've never held back before!"
4446,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,What's out here?
4447,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,"A lot, actually. There's hundreds of little ..."
4448,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Shh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch. Yeah! I'm putting an orchestra together."
4449,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Orchestra, huh? Well, la-di-da."
4450,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans."
4451,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,We ''did'' make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations.
4452,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,There's no time for vacations.
4453,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrow off!
4454,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time?"
4455,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation. Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war."
4456,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"All right, we'll finish our vacations and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence."
4457,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Your turn, Katara. Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?"
4458,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.
4459,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring. And I usually don't use the word ""pristine"". It's one of nature's wonders."
4460,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,Must've changed ownership since I was here.
4461,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"One mango, please."
4462,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy. Excuse me.
4463,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"No worries, I clean up easy."
4464,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,You're a living relic.
4465,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Thanks, I try."
4466,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"An Air Nomad, right in front of me. Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University. Tell me, which of the air temples do you hail from?"
4467,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,The Southern Temple.
4468,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Oh, splendid! Now tell me- what was the primary agricultural product of your people?"
4469,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?"
4470,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal."
4471,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated."
4472,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,Certainly.
4473,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"What, no Fire Nation? Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?"
4474,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,You've made a lot of trips into the desert.
4475,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"All in vain, I'm afraid. I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom, but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel: Wan Shi Tong's Library."
4476,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?
4477,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"This library is more valuable than gold, little lady. It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge, and knowledge is priceless."
4478,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,"Hmm, sounds like good times."
4479,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Oh, it is. According to legend, it was built by the great Knowledge Spirit, Wan Shi Tong, with the help of his ""foxy"" knowledge seekers."
4480,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?"
4481,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka."
4482,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"You're both right. Handsome little creatures. Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers collected books from all over the world, and put them on display for mankind to read, so that we might better ourselves."
4483,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map, maybe?"
4484,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"I wouldn't know. But if such a thing exists, it's in Wan Shi Tong's Library."
4485,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Then it's settled. Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation at the library!"
4486,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,"Uh, hey, what about me? When do I get to pick?"
4487,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.
4488,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,Hmph!
4489,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Of course, there's the matter of finding it. I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert and almost died each time. I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross."
4490,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?"
4491,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,A sky bison?! You actually have one?
4492,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Sandbenders, shoo, away from the bison!"
4493,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Tell me, sky bison, are you the last of your breed? Delightful! I only wish I spoke his tongue. Oh, the stories this beast could tell. Shush, chatty monkey."
4494,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here."
4495,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,Does this place even exist?
4496,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,Some say it doesn't.
4497,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,Shouldn't you have mentioned that before?
4498,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,There it is! That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it.
4499,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air."
4500,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Down there, what's that?"
4501,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. The building in this drawing is enormous.
4502,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,What kind of animal is that?
4503,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"I think that was one of the Knowledge Seekers. Oh, we must be close to the library!"
4504,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"No, this is the library- look! It's completely buried."
4505,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"The library is buried?! My life's ambition is now full of sand. Well, time to start excavating."
4506,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,"Actually, that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be completely intact. And it's huge."
4507,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look.
4508,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,I say you guys go ahead without me.
4509,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,You got something against libraries?
4510,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,"I've held books before. And I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me."
4511,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"Oh, right. Sorry."
4512,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,Let me know if they have something you can listen to.
4513,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Don't worry, buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph."
4514,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,What's up?
4515,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Oh, it's breathtaking! The spirit spared no expense in designing this place. Look at those beautiful buttresses! What's funny?"
4516,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,Nothing. We just like architecture.
4517,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,As do I.
4518,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"My word! The exquisite mosaic handiwork of this tile-rendered avian symbol ... Eh, nice owl."
4519,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,I know you're back there.
4520,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Hello, I'm Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University."
4521,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,You should leave the way you came. Unless you want to become a ''stuffed'' head of anthropology.
4522,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?
4523,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong, ""He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things."" And you are obviously humans, which, by the way, are no longer permitted in my study."
4524,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,What do you have against humans?
4525,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"Hm! Humans only bother learning things to get the edge on other humans. Like that firebender who came to this place a few years ago, looking to destroy his enemy. So ... who are you trying to destroy?"
4526,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,What? No-no-no-no destroying. We're not into that.
4527,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,Then why have you come here?
4528,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,Um ... knowledge for knowledge's sake?
4529,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"If you're going to lie to an all-knowing spirit being, you should at least put some effort into it."
4530,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"I'm not lying, I'm here with the Avatar, and he's the bridge between our worlds. He'll vouch for me."
4531,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Ow. Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit. You have my word."
4532,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"Hmm, very well. I'll let you peruse my vast collection on one condition. To prove your worth as scholars, you have to contribute some worthwhile knowledge."
4533,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,Please accept this tome as a donation to your library.
4534,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"First edition, very nice."
4535,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,I have an authentic waterbending scroll.
4536,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"Ooh, these illustrations are quite stylish."
4537,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Uh ... oh, I know! Hah!"
4538,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,I suppose that counts.
4539,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Oh, great spirit, check this out. Ta-da! It's a special knot. That counts as knowledge!"
4540,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"You're not very bright, are you? Enjoy the library."
4541,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,Bright enough to fool you.
4542,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,"So ... you like ... flying? Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground where I can see. Well, I don't ''see'' the way you do. I feel the vibrations in the ground with my feet. But this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy. Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy."
4543,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things."
4544,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Eh, I've seen weirder."
4545,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed?"
4546,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,I always knew I was special.
4547,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"""The darkest day in Fire Nation history."" It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else."
4548,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Sokka, where are you going?"
4549,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising. The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here.
4550,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,Firebenders.
4551,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.
4552,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"That's so unfair! Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago. I need to know what happened on the darkest day. Hello, little weird fox guy."
4553,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,Seems it's trying to assist you.
4554,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Um, sure, I guess I'll follow you."
4555,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"This room is a true marvel, a mechanical wonder. It's a planetarium that shows the heavens moving."
4556,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Uh, this is beautiful, but how is it helpful?"
4557,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"Maybe these dials represent dates and times. Sokka, try entering that date from that parchment you took."
4558,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl."
4559,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Wow, I got to hand it to you, Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation for sure."
4560,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"Hey, wait. What happened to the sun?"
4561,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Great, you must have broken it."
4562,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"It's not broken. The sun is behind the moon. It's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it. Something awful happened on that day. I don't know what, but I do know why. Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse. Sorry."
4563,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"That makes sense. I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge."
4564,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Fine, you earned it. We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is going down!"
4565,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"Mortals are so predictable, and such terrible liars. You betrayed my trust. From the beginning, you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes."
4566,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information."
4567,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified? Countless others before you have come here seeking weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies.
4568,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"We had no choice. Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love."
4569,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,And now I'm going to protect what ''I'' love.
4570,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,What are you doing?
4571,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,I'm taking my knowledge back. No one will ever abuse it again.
4572,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,He's sinking the building. We've gotta get out of here.
4573,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,I'm afraid I can't allow that. You already know too much.
4574,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,"I already ''told'' you, I don't wanna snuggle. Library sinking. Library sinking! Hi-yah!"
4575,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,"Great Knowledge Spirit, I beg you, do not destroy your vast collection of priceless tomes."
4576,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,We've gotta get back to the surface!
4577,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"Sokka, let's go."
4578,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna to happen.
4579,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,Don't be stupid! We'll find out later!
4580,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"No, we won't. If we leave this place, we'll never get the information. Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover. Katara, take Momo and get out of here!"
4581,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,But ...!
4582,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,Go!
4583,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,"Hurry, Sokka!"
4584,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,What is it now?
4585,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,Who's there?
4586,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,Why are we doing this?
4587,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be."
4588,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,You can't possibly check every single date.
4589,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"I don't have to. We just need to check every date before Sozin's Comet arrives. Because after that- well, try not to think about that."
4590,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,"Come on, eclipse."
4591,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"That's it! The solar eclipse! It's just a few months away. Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se."
4592,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,Don't make me put this down.
4593,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Toph,"No! Stop sinking! No! I'm sorry, Appa."
4594,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,At least I'll have one specimen to add to my collection.
4595,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Wan Shi Tong,"Your waterbending won't do you much good here. I've studied Northern water style, Southern water style, even Foggy Swamp style."
4596,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,That's called Sokka style. Learn it.
4597,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,"Wait! Professor, let's go."
4598,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Zei,I'm not leaving. I can't. I've spent too long trying to find this place. There's not another collection of knowledge like this on earth. I could spend an eternity in here.
4599,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Katara,Just go!
4600,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Sokka,We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming. The Fire Nation's in trouble now!
4601,1,The Library,Earth,2,30,Aang,Where's Appa?
4602,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,I couldn't! The library was sinking! You guys were still inside and-
4603,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,You could've come to get us. I could've saved him!
4604,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone!
4605,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives."
4606,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Who's going to save our lives now? We'll never make it out of here.
4607,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,"That's all any of you guys care about, yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!"
4608,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now."
4609,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,I'm going after Appa.
4610,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Aang, wait!"
4611,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba Sing Se.
4612,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,"You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?"
4613,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Zuko,Maybe we should make camp.
4614,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,"No please, don't stop just for me!"
4615,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,What now?
4616,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!
4617,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Mongke,"If you're surprised we're here, then the Dragon of the West has lost a few steps."
4618,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Zuko,You know these guys?
4619,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapon specialist. They are also a very capable singing group.
4620,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Mongke,We're not here to give a concert. We're here to apprehend fugitives!
4621,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,"Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, Kahchi? I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right?"
4622,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Mongke,Enough stalling! Round 'em up!
4623,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,It's nice to see old friends.
4624,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Zuko,Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you.
4625,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,Hmmm ... Old friends that don't want to attack me ...
4626,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Can't you watch where you're ...
4627,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,No.
4628,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Right. Sorry.
4629,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Come on guys, we've got to stick together."
4630,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,"If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem."
4631,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,"Katara, can I have some more water?"
4632,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it."
4633,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,We're drinking your bending water. You used this on the swamp guy! Urch!
4634,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,It does taste swampy.
4635,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"I'm sorry, it's all we have."
4636,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Not anymore! Look!
4637,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!"
4638,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,There's water trapped inside these!
4639,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,I don't know ...
4640,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Suit yourself. It's very thirst quenching though.
4641,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier. It's the quenchiest!
4642,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Okay, I think you've had enough."
4643,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Who lit Toph on fire?
4644,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,Can I get some of that cactus?
4645,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang."
4646,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?
4647,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,Appa! Appa!
4648,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,No ... No!
4649,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,What is that?
4650,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,What? What is what?
4651,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,It's a giant mushroom! Maybe it's friendly!
4652,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay ...
4653,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!
4654,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Man,"Yeah, a little barefoot blind girl and her friends passed through here a few days ago."
4655,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Man,They went in the desert! Too bad there's almost no chance they survived.
4656,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Xin Fu,"That's okay, 'cause she's wanted dead or alive."
4657,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Yu,No she's not! I'm certain her father wants her alive.
4658,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Xin Fu,"Hey, look ... Fire Nation wanted posters!"
4659,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Yu,So?
4660,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Xin Fu,"So, look who's here."
4661,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now but ... we need to focus on getting out of here."
4662,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it.
4663,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Come on, Aang. We can do this if we work together. Right Toph?"
4664,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,"As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding. I got nothin'."
4665,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,Sokka? Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?
4666,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Why don't we ask the circle birds?
4667,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody, hold hands. We can do this. We have to."
4668,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,I think we should stop for the night.
4669,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,Is there any more water?
4670,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink.
4671,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,"Momo, no! You've killed us all!"
4672,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"No, he hasn't."
4673,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,"Oh, right. Bending."
4674,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library."
4675,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,What?! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that? It was you! You ratted me out!
4676,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Sokka, I was there."
4677,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is.
4678,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is. We can use the stars to guide us. That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day."
4679,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours.
4680,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Zuko,No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy wanderers.
4681,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,"So do we. Ah, this is interesting. I think I found our friend."
4682,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Zuko,You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?
4683,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,I don't think this is a gamble.
4684,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Xin Fu,Let's take them now!
4685,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Yu,"This place is full of desperate characters. If they find out we're collecting a bounty, we might have to fight them all just to keep our prize. Patience."
4686,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,May I have this game?
4687,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Fung,The guest has the first move. I see you favor the white lotus gambit. Not many still cling to the ancient ways.
4688,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,Those who do can always find a friend.
4689,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Fung,Then let us play.
4690,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Fung,"Welcome, brother. The White Lotus opens wide to those who know her secrets."
4691,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Zuko,What are you old gasbags talking about?
4692,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.
4693,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Xin Fu,I'm not waiting all night for these geezers to finish yapping! It's over! You two fugitives are coming with me!
4694,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Fung,I knew it! You two are wanted criminals with a giant bounty on your heads!
4695,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Zuko,I thought you said he would help!
4696,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,He is. Just watch.
4697,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Fung,You think you're going to capture them and collect all that gold?
4698,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Man in the bar,Gold?
4699,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Yu,Uh ... Maybe we shouldn't.
4700,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Come on, get up. We need to go."
4701,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand. I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much.
4702,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,I'm awake. I couldn't sleep.
4703,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit."
4704,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,Appa!
4705,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud! Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch."
4706,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,Wow ... there's hardly any in here.
4707,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving. We need to head this direction.
4708,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,"Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations."
4709,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It's got some kind of compass on it! I bet it can point us out of here! Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it!"
4710,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Fung,"It is an honor to welcome such a high-ranking member of the Order of the White Lotus. Being a Grand Master, you must know so many secrets."
4711,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,You must forgive my nephew. He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.
4712,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.
4713,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,I'm afraid it's members only. Wait out here.
4714,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts.
4715,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.
4716,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock! It must be the magnetic center of the desert.
4717,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,Maybe we can find some water there!
4718,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,Maybe we can find some sandbenders.
4719,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,Ahhh ... Finally! Solid ground!
4720,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look!
4721,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,"Tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww, I feel woozy."
4722,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,I have a natural curiosity.
4723,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,I don't think this is a normal cave. This was carved by something.
4724,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,Yeah ... look at the shape.
4725,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,There's something buzzing in here. Something that's coming for us!
4726,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,What are you doing? That rock almost crushed me!
4727,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,"Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air!"
4728,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,I got this one.
4729,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Sokka, there's nothing there!"
4730,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,I guess my head's not as clear as I thought.
4731,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend!
4732,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here.
4733,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Come on, we're going down."
4734,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,"Toph, shoot a rock right there. Fire!"
4735,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,Yes. Now let's move.
4736,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,On your left!
4737,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,Everything is taken care of. We're heading to Ba Sing Se.
4738,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Fung,The city is filled with refugees. No one will notice two more.
4739,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Iroh,We can hide in plain sight there. And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation. Even I couldn't break through to the city.
4740,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,White Lotus member,"I have the passports for our guests, but there are two men out on the street looking for them."
4741,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Katara,We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar. Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se.
4742,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Ghashiun,"Sorry, father."
4743,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole Appa.
4744,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,I never forget a voice.
4745,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Ghashiun,They're lying! They're the thieves!
4746,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Florist,"As you can see, no one is here but us."
4747,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Yu,We know all about your secret back room. Kick it down.
4748,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Florist,Hey! That room is for flowers only!
4749,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Yu,Some unlucky soul has an incomplete Pai Sho set.
4750,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Xin Fu,Let's go back to finding the girl.
4751,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,You tell me where he is now!
4752,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Ghashiun,I-It wasn't me!
4753,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Toph,You said to put a muzzle on him!
4754,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Ghashiun,I'm sorry! I didn't know that it belonged to the Avatar!
4755,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Aang,Tell me where Appa is!
4756,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Ghashiun,I traded him! To some merchants! He's probably in Ba Sing Se by now! They were going to sell him there! Please! We'll escort you out of the desert! We'll help however we can!
4757,1,The Desert,Earth,2,31,Sokka,Just get out of here! Run!
4758,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,Waterbending bomb! Yeah!
4759,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em."
4760,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,Sorry.
4761,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"So, did you figure out what route we're going to take?"
4762,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here. And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass."
4763,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,You sure that's the best way to go?
4764,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"It's the only way. I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there."
4765,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive?
4766,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse."
4767,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"Oh ... well, okay. I'm glad you're doing better."
4768,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Then to Ba Sing Se we go. No more distractions.
4769,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Than,"Hello there, fellow refugees!"
4770,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"So, you guys are headed to Ba Sing Se, too?"
4771,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Than,Sure are. We're trying to get there before my wife Ying has her baby.
4772,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,Great! We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.
4773,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ying,The Serpent's Pass? Only the truly desperate take that deadly route!
4774,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,"Deadly route. Great pick, Sokka!"
4775,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Well, we are desperate."
4776,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Than,You should come with us to Full Moon Bay. Ferries take refugees across the lake. It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.
4777,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ying,"And it's hidden, so the Fire Nation can't find it."
4778,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?
4779,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.
4780,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Than,"We're all looking for a better life, safe behind the walls of Ba Sing Se."
4781,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Iroh,"Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace ... as a tourist!"
4782,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Zuko,"Look around. We're not tourists, we're refugees. Ugh! I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt. I'm tired of living like this!"
4783,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Jet,"Aren't we all? My name's Jet and these are my Freedom Fighters, Smellerbee and Longshot."
4784,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Smellerbee,Hey.
4785,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Zuko,Hello.
4786,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Jet,"Here's the deal. I hear the captain's eating like a king while the refugees have to feed off his scraps. Doesn't seem fair, does it?"
4787,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Iroh,What sort of king is he eating like?
4788,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Jet,"The fat, happy kind. You want to help us ""liberate"" some food?"
4789,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Zuko,I'm in.
4790,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,I told you already ... no vegetables on the ferry! One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se! Security!
4791,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Cabbage merchant,Ahhh! My cabbages!
4792,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,Next!
4793,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please."
4794,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,Passports?
4795,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports.
4796,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar!
4797,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,That won't be necessary.
4798,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,Next!
4799,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,"I'll take care of this. My name is Toph Beifong, and I'll need four tickets."
4800,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,"Ah, the golden seal of the flying boar! It is my pleasure to help anyone of the Beifong family."
4801,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,"It ''is'' your pleasure. As you can see, I am blind and these three imbeciles are my valets."
4802,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,"But, the animal-"
4803,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,-is my seeing-eye lemur.
4804,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,"Well, normally it's only one ticket per passport, but this document is so official ... I guess it's worth four tickets."
4805,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,Thank you very much.
4806,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"All right, we scammed that lady good!"
4807,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,Tickets and passports please.
4808,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Is there a problem?
4809,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Yeah, I got a problem with you! I've seen your type before. Probably sarcastic, think you're hilarious and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar."
4810,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Do I know you?
4811,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,You mean you don't remember? Maybe you'll remember this!
4812,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Suki!
4813,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Sokka, it's good to see you!"
4814,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,You look so different without your makeup! And the new outfit.
4815,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them. And look at you, sleeveless guy. Been working out?"
4816,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major."
4817,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?
4818,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Yeah. After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees and we've been here ever since. Hi, Momo! Good to see you too! So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry? Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?"
4819,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.
4820,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you doing okay?
4821,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me?
4822,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,I'll talk to the lady for you.
4823,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,"No passports, no tickets!"
4824,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen! You have to make an exception!
4825,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,"No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no more order! You know what that means, no more civilization!"
4826,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,What if we gave them our tickets?
4827,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,No!
4828,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,But ...
4829,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ticket lady,Next!
4830,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass."
4831,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.
4832,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,I can't believe you're still complaining about it.
4833,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,I'm coming too!
4834,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Are you sure that's a good idea?
4835,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come."
4836,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,Just what?
4837,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.
4838,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it."
4839,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ying,Look at this writing! How awful!
4840,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,What does it say?
4841,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"It says, ""abandon hope""."
4842,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ying,How can we abandon hope? It's all we have!
4843,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"I don't know. The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it."
4844,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,What are you talking about?
4845,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this path.
4846,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"Okay, if you say so."
4847,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,The Fire Nation controls the western lake. Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side of it and don't want anyone to find out what it is.
4848,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Than,I'm okay!
4849,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!"
4850,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Suki, are you okay? You have to be more careful! Come on!"
4851,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,"""Thanks for saving my life, Toph."" Hey, no problem, Sokka."
4852,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give away at any moment!"
4853,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Sokka, I'm fine, stop worrying!"
4854,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself! Wait! Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine."
4855,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Smellerbee,Guard's coming!
4856,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"You know, it's okay to miss Appa. What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all."
4857,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.
4858,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring. Come on, you need a hug."
4859,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"Thank you for your concern, Katara."
4860,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,It's a beautiful moon.
4861,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Yeah, it really is."
4862,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself."
4863,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,I know you can.
4864,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,Then why are you acting so overprotective?
4865,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.
4866,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"I lost someone I care about. He didn't die, he just went away. I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was smart and brave and funny ..."
4867,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Who is this guy? Is he taller than me?
4868,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"No, he's about your height."
4869,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Is he better-looking?
4870,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"It ''is'' you, stupid!"
4871,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,Oh!
4872,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,I can't.
4873,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,I'm sorry.
4874,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"No, you shouldn't be."
4875,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Iroh,"So, Smellerbee. That's an unusual name for a young man."
4876,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Smellerbee,Maybe it's because I'm not a man ... I'm a girl!
4877,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Iroh,"Oh, now I see. It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!"
4878,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Smellerbee,"I know, you're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks, Longshot."
4879,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Jet,"From what I heard, people eat like this every night in Ba Sing Se. I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall."
4880,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Iroh,It is a magnificent sight.
4881,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Jet,So you've been there before?
4882,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Iroh,Once. When I was a ... different man.
4883,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Jet,"I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of, but that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se: for a new beginning. A second chance."
4884,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Iroh,That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances.
4885,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"Everyone single file! Aang, I need help!"
4886,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,What is that thing?
4887,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass! Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!"
4888,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,Just because I live near the unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert!
4889,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you."
4890,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,Sokka!
4891,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"I'll distract it. Katara, get everyone across!"
4892,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Toph, come on, it's just ice!"
4893,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,"Actually, I'm going to stay on my little island, where I can see! Okay, I'm coming!"
4894,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice!
4895,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,It's hard to ignore.
4896,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,You're almost there!
4897,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,Help! I can't swim!
4898,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"I'm coming, Toph!"
4899,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,Help!
4900,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,"Oh Sokka, you saved me!"
4901,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Actually, it's me."
4902,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,Oh ... well ... you can go ahead and let me drown now.
4903,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,There's the wall! Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.
4904,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ying,Oh no!
4905,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,What's wrong?
4906,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ying,The baby's coming!
4907,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,What? Now? Can't you hold it in or something?
4908,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"Sokka, calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home."
4909,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real ... human ... thing!
4910,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"It's called a baby and I helped her deliver plenty of those, too. Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent, a big one. Suki, come with me."
4911,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Jet,"You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were. You're an outcast, like me. And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs. Because no one else will."
4912,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Zuko,I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path.
4913,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"You're doing great, Ying. Sokka, where's that water? Now get ready to push. One ... two ... ... three, push!"
4914,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,It's a girl!
4915,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,"So, you want to go see the baby, or are you going to faint like an old lady again?"
4916,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"No, no, I'm good this time."
4917,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"Aang, you have to come see this."
4918,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,She sounds healthy.
4919,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,She's beautiful.
4920,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,It's so ... squishy looking.
4921,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Than,What should we name her?
4922,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ying,I want our daughter's name to be unique. I want it to mean something.
4923,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me ... hopeful again.
4924,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Ying,I know what I want to name our baby now. Hope.
4925,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Than,That's a perfect name. Hope.
4926,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you."
4927,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this."
4928,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,See you in the big city.
4929,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Toph,Say hi to that big fuzzball for me.
4930,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Katara,"You'll find him, Aang."
4931,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"I know. Thank you, Katara. You ready, Momo?"
4932,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Sokka, it's been really great to see you again."
4933,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,"Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?"
4934,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely. But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.
4935,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,So you came along to protect me?
4936,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Suki,"Listen, I'm really sorry about last night. We were talking ... and saying things ... and I just got carried away and before I knew it -"
4937,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Sokka,You talk too much.
4938,1,The Serpent's Pass,Earth,2,32,Aang,"Sorry Momo, Appa's going to have to wait."
4939,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Qin,"This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. Once it tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city. The Earth Kingdom will finally fall, and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father. Nothing can stop us."
4940,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Ty Lee,"Hmmm, what about those muscle-y guys down there?"
4941,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Qin,Please. The drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack.
4942,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Azula,"Oh, I'm sure it is, War Minister Qin, but just to be on the safe side ... Mai and Ty Lee, take the earthbenders out!"
4943,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa."
4944,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,"I was, but something stopped me. Something big."
4945,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?
4946,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,That.
4947,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Ying,We made it to Ba Sing Se and we're still not safe. No one is!
4948,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Earthbender guard,What are you people doing here? Civilians aren't allowed on the wall!
4949,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever is in charge.
4950,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,"It is an honor to welcome you to the Outer Wall, young Avatar, but your help is not needed."
4951,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,Not needed?
4952,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,"''Not'' needed. I have the situation under control. I assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded."
4953,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,What about the Dragon of the West? He got in.
4954,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,"Well ... uh, technically yes, but he was quickly expunged. Nevertheless, that is why the city is named Ba Sing Se. It's the ""impenetrable city"". They don't call it Na Sing Se. That means ""penetrable city."""
4955,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,"Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem."
4956,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,"Not for long. To stop it, I've sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Terra Team."
4957,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,That's a good group name. Very catchy.
4958,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Terra Team leader,Ready ... attack!
4959,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,We're doomed!
4960,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Get a hold of yourself, man!"
4961,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,You're right. I'm sorry.
4962,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help ''now''?
4963,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,"Yes, please."
4964,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,"The question is, how are we going to stop that thing?"
4965,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,Why are you all looking at me?
4966,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,You're the idea guy.
4967,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure.
4968,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,And also the complaining guy.
4969,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,That part I don't mind.
4970,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Ticket woman,"So, Mr. Lee and Mr. ummm ... Mushy, is it?"
4971,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Iroh,It's pronounced Mushi.
4972,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Ticket woman,You telling me how to do my job?
4973,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Iroh,"Uh, no, no. But may I just say you're like a flower in bloom. Your beauty is intoxicating."
4974,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Ticket woman,"You're pretty easy on the eyes yourself, handsome. Raorr! Welcome to Ba Sing Se."
4975,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Zuko,I'm going to forget I saw that.
4976,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,"I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter. He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us."
4977,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Smellerbee,"You don't know anything about him, Jet."
4978,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,I know he didn't get that scar from a waterbender.
4979,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Smellerbee,"Besides, I thought we were going straight now."
4980,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,"We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee. What do you think, Longshot?"
4981,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,I can respect that.
4982,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,What's wrong with him? He doesn't look injured.
4983,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,His chi is blocked. Who did this to you?
4984,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Terra Team member,Two girls ambushed us. One of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs and suddenly I couldn't earthbend anymore and I could barely move. Then she cartwheeled away.
4985,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside."
4986,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh!"
4987,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,Yes?
4988,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,What you just said! That's how we're going to take down the drill! The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders!
4989,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,By hitting its pressure points!
4990,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,We'll take it down from the inside.
4991,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,"Once I whip up some cover, you're not going to be able to see. So, stay close to me."
4992,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,Run!
4993,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Ty Lee,"Hey, look at that dust cloud. It's so ... poofy. Poof."
4994,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Qin,"Don't worry, Princess. I'm sure it's nothing."
4995,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,Everyone into the hole!
4996,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing!"
4997,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,"Oh no, what a nightmare!"
4998,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,Sorry.
4999,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,There!
5000,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Toph, come on!"
5001,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there. I'll try to slow it down out here.
5002,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Okay, good luck!"
5003,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find its weak points.
5004,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,Where are we going to get something like that? What are you doing? Someone's going to hear us!
5005,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it. And when something breaks ...
5006,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,They come to fix it!
5007,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,Hi.
5008,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,This'll work. Thanks!
5009,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell. The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse."
5010,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,"So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city?"
5011,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Tea seller,Get your hot tea here! Finest tea in Ba Sing Se!
5012,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Iroh,Ooh! Jasmine please.
5013,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Iroh,"Blaugh! Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it! What a disgrace!"
5014,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
5015,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together. You want to join the Freedom Fighters?
5016,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Zuko,"Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang."
5017,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,"Come on, we made a great team looting that captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees."
5018,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Zuko,I said no.
5019,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,Have it your way.
5020,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Iroh,Hey!
5021,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Zuko,"What are you doing firebending your tea? For a wise, old man, that was a pretty stupid move!"
5022,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Iroh,"I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ... it's just so sad!"
5023,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that."
5024,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"What's this ""we"" stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work."
5025,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Look, I'm the plan guy. You two are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys. Together, we're Team Avatar!"
5026,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,C'mon team. Don't quit now. We're ...
5027,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,Grrr!
5028,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"I mean, you're almost there."
5029,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall."
5030,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,I don't know how many more of those I have in me.
5031,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,Do you hear that? We took it down! We better get out of here fast!
5032,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Qin,"Congratulations, crew. The drill has made contact with the wall of Ba Sing Se. Start the countdown to victory!"
5033,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,C'mon brace ... budge!
5034,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"This is bad, ''really'' bad."
5035,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!"
5036,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,"Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike. Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've got to be quick and accurate. Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance. And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow. His own weight becomes his downfall, literally."
5037,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through."
5038,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow.
5039,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,And boom! It all comes crashing down!
5040,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,Everyone inside that wall. The whole world is counting on us.
5041,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,The whole world minus the Fire Nation that is.
5042,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,"C'mon, Twinkle Toes, hurry up!"
5043,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,That's enough! We need to get to the next one!
5044,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Engineer,"War Minister, an engineer was ambushed! His schematics were stolen!"
5045,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Second Engineer,"War Minister, a brace on the starboard side has been cut clean through! It's sabotage, sir!"
5046,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Azula,"Let's go, ladies!"
5047,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Good work, Team Avatar! Now Aang just needs to ... duck!"
5048,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,Whoa!
5049,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,Hey.
5050,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,"Guys, get out of here. I know what I need to do."
5051,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,Wait. You need this water more than I do!
5052,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Azula,Follow them! The Avatar's mine!
5053,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,Slurry pipeline? What does that mean?
5054,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,It's rock and water mixed together. It means our way out!
5055,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Mai,"Ugh, disgusting!"
5056,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Ty Lee,C'mon! You heard Azula. We have to follow them!
5057,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Mai,She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me. I am not going in that wall sludge juice.
5058,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"Why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak?"
5059,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill. Then when Aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop!"
5060,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,"This looks like a good spot, Momo. General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!"
5061,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,General Sung,"Soldiers, whatever you do, don't stop shooting rocks down there!"
5062,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Good technique, little sister! Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe!"
5063,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"You know, I'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day! You're like a chattering hog-monkey!"
5064,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"Just bend the slurry, woman!"
5065,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,You guys need some help?
5066,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"Toph, help me plug up this drain."
5067,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,What I'd give to be a metalbender.
5068,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,"Momo, get out of here!"
5069,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,"Thanks, Momo. I owe you one. Now all I need ... Actually, that is what I need for once."
5070,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,Woohoo!
5071,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,Here it comes!
5072,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Mai,We lost.
5073,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Train conductor,Last call for Ba Sing Se!
5074,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Smellerbee,"Jet, relax. So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal."
5075,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Jet,He heated it himself! Those guys are ''firebenders''!
5076,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Iroh,What a handsome baby.
5077,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Ying,Thank you.
5078,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"I just want to say, good effort out there today, Team Avatar!"
5079,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,"Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on."
5080,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,"How about ... the Boomeraang Squad! See it's good because it's got ""Aang"" in it. Boomer''aang''."
5081,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Aang,I kind of like that one.
5082,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,Let's talk about this on our way into the city.
5083,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,The Aang Gang?
5084,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Katara,Sokka ...
5085,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,The Fearsome Foursome?
5086,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Toph,You're crazy.
5087,1,The Drill,Earth,2,33,Sokka,Why? We're fearsome!
5088,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"Look, the Inner Wall! I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece."
5089,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!"
5090,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,You been hitting the cactus juice again?
5091,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us."
5092,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa."
5093,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,It's such a big city.
5094,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,He's a giant bison! Where could someone possibly hide him?
5095,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Oh.
5096,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,Back in the city. Great.
5097,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,What's the problem? It's amazing!
5098,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"It's just a bunch of walls and rules. You wait, you'll get sick of it in a couple of days."
5099,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"Hello, my name is Joo Dee! I have been given the great honor of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se. And you must be Sokka, Katara, and Toph! Welcome to our wonderful city. Shall we get started?"
5100,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King, immediately."
5101,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,Great! Let's begin our tour. And then I'll show you to your new home here. I think you'll like it!
5102,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Ugh! Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the king about the War, it's important."
5103,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here.
5104,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,This is the Lower Ring.
5105,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,What's that wall for?
5106,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls! There are the ones outside protecting us, and the ones inside, that help maintain order. This is where our newest arrivals live, as well as our craftsman and artisans, people that work with their hands. It's so quaint and lively!"
5107,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"You do want to watch your step, though."
5108,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?
5109,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,This is why I never came here before. I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live.
5110,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,"I just want our place to look nice, in case someone brings home a lady friend!"
5111,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Zuko,This city is a prison. I don't want to make a life here.
5112,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,"Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not. Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we start this afternoon!"
5113,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,"Look at them, firebenders living right under everyone's nose."
5114,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"This is the Middle Ring of Ba Sing Se, home to the financial district, shops and restaurants, and the university."
5115,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Yeah, we met a professor from the Ba Sing Se University. He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is ''absolutely crucial for the Earth King to hear''!"
5116,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Is that woman deaf? She only seems to hear every other word I say.
5117,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"It's called ""being handled"". Get used to it."
5118,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Zuko,Ridiculous.
5119,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,"Uh, does this possibly come in a larger size?"
5120,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Pao,I have extra string in the back. Have some tea while you wait!
5121,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,Blech! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!
5122,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Zuko,"Uncle, that's what ''all'' tea is."
5123,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?! We'll have to make some major changes around here.
5124,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,The Upper Ring is home to our most important citizens. Your house is not too far from here!
5125,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,What's inside that wall?
5126,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,And who're the mean-looking guys in robes?
5127,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"Inside is the Royal Palace. Those men are agents of the Dai Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se. They are the guardians of all our traditions!"
5128,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,Can we see the king now?
5129,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"Oh no, one doesn't just pop in on the Earth King!"
5130,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,Here we are! Your new home.
5131,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"More good news! Your request for an audience with the Earth King is being processed, and should be put through in about month. Much more quickly than usual!"
5132,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,A month?
5133,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"Six to eight weeks, actually."
5134,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,Isn't it nice? I think you'll really enjoy it here.
5135,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,I think we would enjoy it more if we weren't staying for so long. Can't we see the Earth King ''any'' sooner?
5136,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,The Earth King is very busy running the finest city in the world! But he will see you as soon as time permits.
5137,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,"If we're going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa."
5138,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,I'd like to escort you anywhere you'd like to go.
5139,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,We don't ''need'' a babysitter.
5140,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"Oh, I won't get in the way. And to leave you alone would make me a bad host! Where shall we start?"
5141,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Pet store owner,"I'm sorry, but I haven't heard anything about a flying bison. I didn't even know there ''were'' any."
5142,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Where's the black market? Who runs it? Come on, you know!"
5143,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,University student,"Hmm ... I've never seen any sandbenders or nomads around here. You should ask Professor Zei, he teaches the class on desert cultures."
5144,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,''Right''. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?
5145,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,University student,Uh ...
5146,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,University student,I don't know. I'm not a political science student ... I've got to get to class.
5147,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Hey, come with me."
5148,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Pong,You're the Avatar! I heard you were in town. I'm Pong.
5149,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,"Nice to meet you, Pong."
5150,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"So, Pong, what's goin' on with this city? Why is everyone here so scared here to talk about the war?"
5151,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Pong,War? Scared? What do you mean?
5152,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,I can feel you shaking.
5153,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Pong,"Look, I'm just a minor government official. I've waited three years to get this house. I don't want go get into trouble."
5154,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,Get in trouble with who?!
5155,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Pong,"Shh, listen, you can't mention the War here. And whatever you do, stay away from the Dai Li."
5156,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,Would you like a pot of tea?
5157,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Zuko,We've been working in a tea shop all day! I'm ''sick'' of tea!
5158,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,"""Sick of tea?"" That's like being sick of breathing! Have you seen the spark rocks to heat up the water?"
5159,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,"They're not there. You'll have to firebend, old man. Where're you going?"
5160,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,I borrowed our neighbors'. Such kind people.
5161,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,I got it! I know how we're going to see the Earth King!
5162,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"How are we supposed to do that? ""One doesn't just ''pop'' in on the Earth King!"""
5163,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,The king is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.
5164,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,"You mean, platypus bear?"
5165,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"No, it just says 'bear'."
5166,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Certainly you mean his pet skunk bear.
5167,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,Or his armadillo bear.
5168,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,Gopher bear?
5169,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,Just ... bear.
5170,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,This place ... is weird.
5171,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd!
5172,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,Won't work.
5173,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,Why not?
5174,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd will spot you a mile away. You've got no manners!"
5175,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"Excuse me? ''I've'' got no manners?! You're not exactly ""lady fancy fingers!"""
5176,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"I learned proper society behavior and ''chose'' to leave it. You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late."
5177,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Aha, but you learned it! You could teach us!"
5178,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,"Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty. Your Momo-ness."
5179,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Avatar Aang, how do you do? Go on."
5180,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys!"
5181,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,But I feel so fancy!
5182,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,Earth!
5183,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Fire!
5184,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,"Wow, you look beautiful."
5185,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"Don't talk to the commoners, Katara. First rule of society."
5186,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate."
5187,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Smellerbee,"Jet, we need to talk."
5188,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Smellerbee,"We've been talking, and we think you're becoming obsessed with this. It's not healthy."
5189,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,"Oh, really? You both think this?"
5190,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Smellerbee,We came here to make a fresh start. But you won't let this go. Even though there is no real proof!
5191,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,"Well, maybe if you'd help me!"
5192,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Smellerbee,"Jet, you gotta stop this."
5193,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Customer,This is the best tea in the city!
5194,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,The secret ingredient is love.
5195,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Pao,I think you're due for a raise.
5196,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,I'm tired of waiting! These two men are firebenders!
5197,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,"I know they're firebenders, I saw the old man heating his tea!"
5198,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Customer,He works in a tea shop.
5199,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,He's a firebender! I'm ''telling'' you!
5200,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Customer,"Drop your swords, boy. Nice and easy."
5201,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,"You'll have to defend yourself. Then everyone will know. Go ahead, show them what you can do."
5202,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Zuko,You want a show? I'll give you a show!
5203,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Guard,Invitation please.
5204,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,I think this will do.
5205,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Guard,"No entry without an invitation. Step out of line, please."
5206,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us! I'm going to have to tell them ''who'' didn't let me in."
5207,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Guard,Step out of line please.
5208,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"Sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations. She's blind. Do you think you could help us? Our family's inside and I'm sure they're ''very'' worried."
5209,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,"I am honored, please come with me."
5210,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Older guest,He's taking all the good stuff!
5211,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Younger guest,Quiet! You don't know what I had to do to get seats ''this'' near the bear!
5212,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,"It's beautiful, isn't it? By the way, I'm Long Feng. I'm a cultural minister to the king."
5213,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"I'm Kwa Mai, and this is ... Dum. Ow!"
5214,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,Now where is your family? I'd ''love'' to meet them.
5215,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"Uh ... I don't see them right now, but I'm sure we'll find them soon. Thanks for all your help."
5216,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,"Don't worry, as your escort it would be dishonorable to abandon you ladies without finding your family first. We'll keep looking."
5217,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,Where are they?
5218,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Look, I came up with a back-up plan. We dress Momo like a ghost, okay? He flies by the guards, creating a distraction. Then, we blast a hole in the wall-"
5219,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,Or we could go in as these guys. Toph said we might pass as busboys!
5220,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Okay ... But remember that Momo ghost plan. I think it's a winner.
5221,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,You must be getting tired of using those swords. Why don't you go ahead and firebend at me?
5222,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,"Please, son, you're confused! You don't know what you're doing!"
5223,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,Bet you wish he'd help you out with a little fire blast right now.
5224,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Zuko,''You're'' the one who needs help.
5225,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,Where are Toph and Katara?
5226,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Forget about them! Just keep an eye out for the king.
5227,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,I don't know what he looks like.
5228,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"You know, ''royal'', flowing robe, fancy jewelry."
5229,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,That could be ''anyone''!
5230,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"Another crab puff, please."
5231,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,You found us!
5232,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,"I'd know your little footsteps anywhere, Twinkle Toes."
5233,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Thanks for letting us in!
5234,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,"Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in ''won't'' let us out of his sight!"
5235,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,''What'' guy?
5236,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,"What are you doing here? You have to leave immediately, or we will be in terrible trouble!"
5237,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Not until we see the king.
5238,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee,You don't understand. You must go.
5239,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Guest,Aarrrh! Oh!
5240,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,"Sorry. No, don't shout."
5241,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Guest,The Avatar! I didn't know the Avatar would be here.
5242,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,You keep their attention while I look for the king.
5243,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,"Watch this, everybody!"
5244,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Dai Li agent,Drop your weapons.
5245,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,Arrest them! They're firebenders!
5246,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,This poor boy is confused. We're just simple refugees.
5247,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Pao,"This young man wrecked my tea shop, and assaulted my employees!"
5248,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Customer,"It's true, sir. We saw the whole thing. This crazy kid attacked the finest tea maker in the city."
5249,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Iroh,"Oh, ho, ho. That's very sweet."
5250,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Dai Li agent,"Come with us, son."
5251,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,You don't understand! They're Fire Nation! You have to believe me!
5252,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Aang! The Earth King!
5253,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,"Greetings, Your Majesty."
5254,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,"Hey, let me go!"
5255,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,"Avatar, it is a great honor to meet you. I am Long Feng, Grand Secretariat of Ba Sing Se and head of the Dai Li. I'd like to talk to you. Your friends will be waiting for us in the library."
5256,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,Why won't you let us talk to the king? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!
5257,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,The Earth King has no time to get involved with political squabbles and the day to day minutia of military activities.
5258,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,This could be the most important thing he's ever heard.
5259,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,"What's most important to his royal majesty is maintaining the ''cultural'' heritage of Ba Sing Se. All his duties relate to issuing decrees on such matters. It's ''my'' job to oversee the rest of the city's resources, including the military."
5260,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,So the king is just a figurehead.
5261,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Toph,He's your puppet!
5262,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,"Oh, no, no. His Majesty is an icon, a god to his people. He can't sully his hands with the hourly change of an endless war."
5263,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Sokka,But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless. You could lead an invasion ...
5264,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,Enough! I don't want to hear your ridiculous plan. It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se that the War not be mentioned within the walls. Constant news of an escalating war will throw the citizens of Ba Sing Se into a state of panic.
5265,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,"You have to believe me, they're firebenders! They won't stop until they win the War."
5266,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Dai Li agent,"Calm down, you're safe now."
5267,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Dai Li agent,There's no war in Ba Sing Se.
5268,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Jet,What're you talking about? Where do you think all the refugees come from? You can't hide it!
5269,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,"In silencing talk of conflict, Ba Sing Se remains a peaceful, orderly utopia: the last one on Earth."
5270,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Dai Li agent,"There is no war within the walls. Here we are safe. Here, we are free."
5271,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,You can't keep the truth from all these people. They ''have'' to know.
5272,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Aang,I'll tell them! I'll make sure everyone knows!
5273,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Long Feng,"Until now, you've been treated as our honored guest. But from now on, you will be watched every moment by Dai Li agents. If you mention the War to anyone, you will be expelled from the city. I understand you've been looking for your bison. It would be quite a shame if you were not able to complete your quest. Now, Joo Dee will show you to your home."
5274,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee replacement,"Come with me, please."
5275,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Katara,What happened to Joo Dee?
5276,1,City of Walls and Secrets,Earth,2,34,Joo Dee replacement,I'm Joo Dee. I'll be your host as long as you're in our wonderful city.
5277,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,Toph! Aren't you gonna get ready for the day?
5278,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,I'm ready.
5279,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,"You're not gonna wash up? You've got a little dirt on your ... everywhere, actually."
5280,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,"You call it dirt, I call it a healthy coating of earth!"
5281,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,Hmm ... You know what we need? A girl's day out!
5282,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,Do I have to?!
5283,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,It'll be fun!
5284,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,The Fancy Lady Day Spa? Sounds like my kinda place.
5285,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,Are you ready for some ''serious'' pampering?
5286,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,"Sure, Katara, whatever you say. As long as they don't touch my feet."
5287,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,"Well, that wasn't so bad. I'm not usually into that stuff but I actually feel ... girly."
5288,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,I'm glad. It's about time we did something fun together.
5289,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Girl with umbrella,"Wow, great make-up."
5290,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,Thanks.
5291,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Girl with umbrella,For a clown!
5292,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,"Don't listen to them, let's just keep walking."
5293,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Star,I think she looks cute. Like that time we put a sweater on your pet poodle monkey.
5294,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Third girl,"Good one, Star."
5295,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,"Let's go, Toph."
5296,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,"No, no, that ''was'' a good one. Like your poodle monkey. You know what else is a good one?"
5297,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,Now ''that'' was funny.
5298,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,Those girls don't know what they're talking about.
5299,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,"It's okay. One of the good things about being blind, is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearance. I don't care what I look like. I'm not looking for anyone's approval. I know who I am."
5300,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,"That's what I really admire about you, Toph. You're so strong, and confident, and self-assured. And I know it doesn't matter, but ... You're really pretty."
5301,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,I am?
5302,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,"Yeah, you are."
5303,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Toph,"I'd return the compliment, but I've no idea how you look like. Thank you, Katara."
5304,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Katara,Ow!
5305,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Shop owner,"If this is for a romantic picnic, may I suggest this lavender one?"
5306,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"No, it's not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion. The moon flower likes partial shade."
5307,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Boy's mother,Shhh. It's okay. Shhh.
5308,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home."
5309,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Huge round angry face,Hey!
5310,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and seek to restore honor."
5311,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Huge round angry face,"When I'm through with you kids, the window won't be the only thing that's broken."
5312,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,But not this time. Run!
5313,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Tycho,"You, give me all your money!"
5314,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,What are you doing?
5315,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Tycho,I'm mugging you!
5316,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,With that stance?
5317,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Tycho,"Huh? What're you talking about? Just give me your money, old man!"
5318,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"With a poor stance, you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over."
5319,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat. Much better! But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type."
5320,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Tycho,I know. I'm ... I'm just confused.
5321,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Tycho,So you really think I could be a good masseur?
5322,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,Of course!
5323,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Tycho,This is so great. No one has ever believed in me.
5324,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing."
5325,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"Happy birthday, my son. If only I could have helped you. Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home."
5326,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Aang,"Hey there, fellow. You look hungry."
5327,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Kenji,They ''are'' hungry. The Dai Li won't give me any money because the kids stopped coming. And the kids won't come because my zoo's nasty and broke.
5328,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Aang,What kinda animal is that?
5329,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Kenji,"Oh, that's a rabaroo. I wish I could get her a big open prairie like she likes. I'd let her hop away to happiness."
5330,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Aang,Let's do it!
5331,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Kenji,Say again?
5332,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Aang,There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city.
5333,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Kenji,But how're you gonna transport all these wild critters?
5334,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Aang,"Don't worry, I'm great with animals."
5335,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Cabbage merchant,"My cabba- Oh, forget it."
5336,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Aang,This was so much easier in my head.
5337,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Kenji,But you ''have'' to open this gate.
5338,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Guard,Or what?
5339,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Kenji,Or ''that''!
5340,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Aang,"Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?"
5341,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Kenji,"Excellent job, Avatar. You should think about working with animals for a living."
5342,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Young guest,"Mommy, Miss Snowflake got out of the house again."
5343,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Adult guest,Fluffykins? What are you doing down there?
5344,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Kenji,"On second thought, you should probably stick to saving people."
5345,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,What's this?
5346,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Lady on stage,"Through all the long night, winter moon glows with bright love, sleet her silver tears."
5347,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,"Ahh, poetry."
5348,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,I am so sorry. Something struck me in the rear. I just ... wound up ... here.
5349,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,"They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe. I am not an oaf."
5350,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Ladies,Oooooh!
5351,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,"You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard."
5352,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Ladies,Oooooh!
5353,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Ladies,Oooooh!
5354,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,"I calls it easy. Like I paddle my canoe, I'll paddle yours too!"
5355,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,"Squish, squash, sling that slang. I'm always right back at ya, like my ... boomerang!"
5356,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,"That's right, I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an ""okka"", young ladies, I rocked ya!"
5357,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Guard,"Uh, that's one too many syllables there, bub."
5358,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Sokka,Poetry ...
5359,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,"Uncle, we have a problem. One of the customers is on to us. Don't look now but there is a girl over there at the corner table. She knows we're Fire Nation. Didn't I say don't look?!"
5360,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"You're right, Zuko. I've seen that girl in here quite a lot. Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you."
5361,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,What?
5362,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,Thank you for the tea. What's your name?
5363,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,My name's Lee. My uncle and I just moved here.
5364,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,"Hi Lee, my name's Jin. Thank you and ... well, I was wondering if you would like to go out sometime."
5365,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,He'd love to!
5366,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,Great. I'll meet you in front of the shop at sundown.
5367,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,"Hey. Well, look at you. You look so cute."
5368,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,It took my uncle ten minutes to do my hair.
5369,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,"So, how do you like the city so far?"
5370,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,It's okay.
5371,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,Nothing.
5372,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,She is not my girlfriend!
5373,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,You have ... quite an appetite for a girl.
5374,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,"Umm ... thanks? So, Lee, where were you and your uncle living before you came here?"
5375,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,"Umm ... well, we've been traveling around for a long time."
5376,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,Oh. Why were you traveling so much?
5377,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,"We were ... uh, part of this traveling circus."
5378,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,"Really? What did you do? Wait, lemme guess. You juggled!"
5379,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,"Yes, I juggled."
5380,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,I've always wanted to learn how to juggle. Can you show me something?
5381,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,I haven't practiced for a while.
5382,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,"It's all right. Hey, I want to show you one of my favorite places in the city."
5383,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,I'm so excited for you to see the Firelight Fountain. The lamps make the water sparkle and reflect in the pool in the most beautiful way.
5384,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,I can't believe it! They aren't lit.
5385,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,"Close your eyes, and don't peek."
5386,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,"Okay, now you can look."
5387,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,"Oh, wow, What happened? How did they light? What did you?"
5388,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,I've brought you something. It's a coupon for a free cup of tea.
5389,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,"Lee, this is so sweet."
5390,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,Your uncle is a good teacher. I have something for you too. Now it's your turn to close your eyes.
5391,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Jin,What's wrong?
5392,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,It's complicated. I have to go.
5393,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Iroh,"How was your night, Prince Zuko?"
5394,1,The Tales of Ba Sing Se,Earth,2,35,Zuko,It was nice.
5395,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Toph,No! Stop sinking!
5396,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Toph,Don't make me put this down!
5397,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Ghashiun,Put a muzzle on him!
5398,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Toph,"I'm sorry, Appa."
5399,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Ghashiun,Ransack his saddle. Who knows what treasures are stashed in there!
5400,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Ghashiun,He's tied up good. He can't hurt you.
5401,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Ghashiun,Nothing. It's the one we stole from the Hami Tribe. Did you empty the saddle? That's it? Nothing but garbage!
5402,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Ghashiun,"Uh, pretty good. Most of the time."
5403,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Aang,Appa! Appa!
5404,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Ghashiun,He's your problem now!
5405,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Aang,Appa! No. No!
5406,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Trainer,"I understand you've had a rather hard time lately. That's too bad. You probably felt you had no choice but to behave outrageously, like a wild animal. But don't worry. You won't anymore. Because I am going to break you."
5407,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Trainer,"Hungry? Don't worry, I'm going to feed you too. But not yet. First, I'm going to show you how you'll earn it."
5408,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Trainer,"Of course, when you perform, the hoops will be flaming. And if you are careful, you won't get burned. You're about to be sorry. It's obvious that whoever your previous owner was, he had no idea how to handle you properly."
5409,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Fire Nation man,I'm gonna to go get a bag of sizzle crisps. Stay here and stay away from that monster. Behave yourself or you'll regret it.
5410,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Trainer,"He's a difficult creature, stubborn and willful. I need more time with him. It's too risky right now."
5411,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Shuzumu,"Too risky? What are you talking about? This is the circus, home of fear and danger. I want the wind buffalo to perform tonight."
5412,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Trainer,"If you don't behave yourself, you'll regret it."
5413,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Fire Nation man,Let's go.
5414,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Unnamed Fire Nation boy,"See you later, buddy."
5415,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Shuzumu,"Ladies and gentlemen, now for something truly special. A noble beast, so magnificent and rare, it hasn't been seen by human eyes in generations. I give you ... the wind buffalo!"
5416,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Trainer,"Up. Up, you insolent cow!"
5417,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Unnamed Fire Nation boy,Run away! Get away from him!
5418,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Fire Nation man,Fabulous!
5419,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Unnamed Fire Nation boy,"Go, you can do it."
5420,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Trainer,"Get back here, you stupid beast!"
5421,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Iio,Choose well. A sky bison is a companion for life.
5422,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Aang,I guess this means we'll always be together.
5423,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Aang,Always.
5424,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Farmer,Ahhh! It's some kind of monster!
5425,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Zuko,Uncle? What are you looking at? Is there something out there?
5426,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Iroh,"Uh, it's nothing. Go back to sleep."
5427,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Suki,"Wait, let me see that. No, it couldn't be. Appa? Oh, no. It's gonna be okay, Appa. I have to leave, but I'm gonna be back soon with help."
5428,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Suki,No sudden movements. He's been lost for a while and he looks like he's hurt. He's shy around people and scared. Stay low and stay quiet.
5429,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Suki,"Yes, so he can't be too far from here. It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet. Give him some space! Appa, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend. I want to help you. You're hurt. We can help you feel better. And we can help you find Aang."
5430,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Azula,"My, my, you're easy to find. It's really astounding my brother hasn't captured you yet."
5431,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Suki,What do you want with us?
5432,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Azula,Who are you? The Avatar's ''fan girls''?
5433,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Ty Lee,"Oh, I get it. Good one, Azula."
5434,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Suki,"If you're looking for the Avatar, you're out of luck."
5435,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Azula,"No Avatar, huh. Well, that's okay. Any friend of the Avatar is an enemy of mine!"
5436,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Mai,"You're so colorful, it's making me nauseous."
5437,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Ty Lee,You're not prettier than we are.
5438,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Azula,"Afraid of fire, I see. That's good. You should be."
5439,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Suki,"Go, Appa! Fly away from here!"
5440,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Suki,Get out of here! You have to find Aang! We'll be okay!
5441,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Azula,Don't you know fans just make flames stronger?
5442,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Pathik,Hello. I am Guru Pathik. I know I'm not the person you expected. And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. The world is full of surprises.
5443,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Pathik,"Someone looks very well rested, judging by your bed head."
5444,1,Appa's Lost Days,Earth,2,36,Pathik,"I have prepared a message for Aang. May I attach it to your horn? You and the Avatar's energies are mixed. You have an unbreakable bond. By reading your energy, I can sense where Aang is. Funny, what invisible strings connect us all. I'll see you again, great beast."
5445,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy."
5446,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Look, we escaped from the Dai Li. We got Appa back. I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll."
5447,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.
5448,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we'll need the Earth King's support."
5449,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,"What makes you think we'll get it? I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang."
5450,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different."
5451,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us."
5452,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,I'm with Sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se. And I can't even see!
5453,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth. About the conspiracy and the War."
5454,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,See? Aang's with me. It's the whole reason we came here in the first place. We have to try.
5455,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change."
5456,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,"I don't trust the new positive Sokka. Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!?"
5457,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. So?
5458,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,Let's fly!
5459,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying!
5460,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,There it is! That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in the center!
5461,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming.
5462,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and- Aahh!"
5463,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,What was that?
5464,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Surface-to-air rocks! More incoming!
5465,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,Sorry!
5466,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King!
5467,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side! Sorry."
5468,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,In there!
5469,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Toph, which way to the Earth King?"
5470,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,How should I know? I'm still voting we ''leave'' Ba Sing Se.
5471,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Palace woman,Burglar!
5472,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Sorry. Wrong door.
5473,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Iroh,You did the right thing. Letting the Avatar's bison go free.
5474,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Zuko,I don't feel right.
5475,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Iroh,Zuko!
5476,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere. Yaaah! A little warning next time?
5477,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,We need to talk to you.
5478,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,They're here to overthrow you.
5479,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"No, we're on your side. We're here to help."
5480,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,You have to trust us.
5481,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me to trust you?"
5482,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,He has a good point.
5483,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"If you are on my side, then drop your weapons and stand down!"
5484,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"See? We're friends, Your Earthiness."
5485,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,Detain the assailants!
5486,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.
5487,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again.
5488,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,The Avatar? You're the Avatar?
5489,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Uh, no. Him."
5490,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,Over here.
5491,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,"What does it matter, Your Highness? They're enemies of the state."
5492,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,Perhaps you're right. Though Bosco seems to like him. I'll hear what he has to say.
5493,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"Well, sir, there's a war going on right now. For the past one hundred years in fact. The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you."
5494,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,A secret war? That's crazy!
5495,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,Completely!
5496,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,"All lies. I've never even seen a sky bison, Your Majesty. Frankly, I thought they were extinct."
5497,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,Your claim is difficult to believe. Even from an Avatar.
5498,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,"These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks. If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction."
5499,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,I have to trust my advisor.
5500,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Wait! I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison. Ask him to lift his robe.
5501,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,What? I am ''not'' disrobing!
5502,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,Right there! Appa bit him!
5503,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Never met a sky bison, huh?"
5504,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,That happens to be a large birth mark. Thanks for showing everyone.
5505,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,Well I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.
5506,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Of course there is!
5507,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"Yup. That pretty much proves it. But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory. Though, I suppose this matter's worth looking into."
5508,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Iroh,You're burning up. You have an intense fever. This will help cool you down.
5509,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Zuko,So thirsty.
5510,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,So this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this ... public.
5511,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before?
5512,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place."
5513,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,It's gone!
5514,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Oh don't tell me- ! That's okay. Still got my positive attitude.
5515,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!
5516,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,Hm ... That seems awfully convenient.
5517,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more."
5518,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"Long Feng was right. This was a waste of time. If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace."
5519,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,The wall. They'll never be able to cover that up in time.
5520,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"Oh, yeah. If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real."
5521,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,No Earth King has ever been to the Outer Wall. I don't have any more time for this nonsense.
5522,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa."
5523,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,First time flying?
5524,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,It's both thrilling and terrifying!
5525,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,"Yeah. I hate it, too."
5526,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,I have to be honest with you: part of me really hopes that what you're telling me about this war isn't true.
5527,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,I wish it wasn't.
5528,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Blue dragon,"It's getting late. Are you planning to retire soon, my lord?"
5529,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Zuko,I'm not tired.
5530,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Blue dragon,"Relax, Fire Lord Zuko. Just let go. Give in to it. Shut your eyes for a while."
5531,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Red dragon,"No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do not listen to the blue dragon. You should get out of here right now. Go! Before it's too late!"
5532,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Blue dragon,"Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko."
5533,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Blue dragon,Sleep. Just like ''mother''!
5534,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Ursa,Zuko! Help me!
5535,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,It's still there!
5536,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,What is that?
5537,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,It's a drill. A giant drill made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls.
5538,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,I can't believe I never knew.
5539,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,"I can explain this, Your Majesty. This is nothing more than ... a construction project."
5540,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"Really? Then perhaps you could explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your ""construction project""."
5541,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,Well it's imported of course. You know you can't trust domestic machinery. Surely you don't believe these children instead of your most loyal attendant?
5542,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,Dai Li! Arrest Long Feng! I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom.
5543,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Long Feng,You can't arrest me! You all need me more than you know!
5544,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Looks like Long Feng is long gone! Ha! Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one."
5545,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"I want to thank you, young heroes, for opening my eyes. All this time, what I thought was a great metropolis was merely a city of fools. And that makes me the king fool. We're at war. With the Fire Nation."
5546,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness: because we think you can help us end the war."
5547,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.
5548,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity: A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be completely blocked out by the moon, and the firebenders will be helpless."
5549,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"What are you suggesting, Sokka?"
5550,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. The Day of Black Sun.
5551,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se. We'd be completely vulnerable.
5552,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance."
5553,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,Very well. You have my support.
5554,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,General How,Your Majesty. I apologize for the interruption.
5555,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"This is General How. He's the leader of the Council of Five, my highest ranking generals."
5556,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,General How,We searched Long Feng's office. I think we found something that will interest everybody.
5557,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,General How,There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se. Including you kids.
5558,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,Secret files?
5559,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"""Toph Beifong."""
5560,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,It's a letter from your mom. Your mom's here in the city. And she wants to see you.
5561,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? That's just sad.
5562,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,Aang?
5563,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,General How,This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.
5564,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,It's from the Eastern Air Temple.
5565,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?
5566,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,I'm afraid not.
5567,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Oh.
5568,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,General How,But there is an intelligence report that might interest you.
5569,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"""A small fleet of Water Tribe ships."""
5570,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,What? That could be Dad!
5571,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"""Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay. Led by Hakoda."" It ''is'' Dad!"
5572,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Iroh,"You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea."
5573,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Zuko,What's happening?
5574,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Iroh,Your critical decision. What you did beneath that lake. It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body.
5575,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Zuko,What's that mean?
5576,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Iroh,"You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be."
5577,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a guru.
5578,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,What's a guru? Some kind of poisonous blow fish?
5579,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State."
5580,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,And I can't believe we know where our dad is now.
5581,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,I know what you mean. My mom's in the city. And from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.
5582,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,This is all such big news! Where do we even start?
5583,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"I hate to say it, but we have to split up."
5584,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together! Now you want us to separate?
5585,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"You have to meet this guru, Aang. If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready."
5586,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad."
5587,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. I guess that's me.
5588,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"No, Sokka. I know how badly you wanna help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay. I'll stay here with the king."
5589,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,You are the nicest ... sister ... ever!
5590,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"Easy there, big brother ... Though you're right. I am."
5591,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,Katara? I need to tell you something. I've been wanting to say it for a long time.
5592,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,"What is it, Aang?"
5593,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"Katara, I-"
5594,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,All right. Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip?
5595,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"Aang and Sokka, I wish you a good journey. Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks. We look forward to your safe return."
5596,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Soldier,Your Majesty. There are three female warriors to see you. They're from the island of Kyoshi.
5597,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,That's Suki!
5598,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,You know these warriors?
5599,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Oh yeah. The Kyoshi Warriors are a skilled group of fighters. Trustworthy too. They're good friends of ours.
5600,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,Then we shall welcome them as honored guests.
5601,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,Wait. Aang.
5602,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,I'm really gonna miss you guys.
5603,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Katara,Me too.
5604,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,Yeah.
5605,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"Aahh! Great. That's enough. Okay, we love each other. Seriously."
5606,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,"You see, Aang? A little positive thinking works wonders. We got the king on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me."
5607,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Aang,"Yeah. Girls are waiting for us. Thanks, positive attitude."
5608,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Sokka,Everything is gonna work out perfectly. From now on and forever.
5609,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Agent,"Dinner. The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King, but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir."
5610,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Toph,Hello? Mom? Anyone home? Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with!?
5611,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Xin Fu,One loud-mouthed little brat who strayed too far from home.
5612,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Kuei,"In our hour of need, it is with the highest honor that I welcome our esteemed allies, the Kyoshi Warriors!"
5613,1,The Earth King,Earth,2,38,Azula,We are the Earth King's humble servants.
5614,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Zuko,What's that smell?
5615,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.
5616,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Zuko,"Actually, it smells delicious. I'd love a bowl, Uncle."
5617,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,"Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow."
5618,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Zuko,"It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. Things are looking up, Uncle."
5619,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,You haven't seen your dad in over two years. You must be so excited!
5620,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,"I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach."
5621,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Don't be nervous. He's going to be so happy to see you!
5622,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this guru?
5623,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes. See you in a week. Yip yip!
5624,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Water Tribe warrior,"Sokka, good to see you."
5625,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Hakoda,Sokka.
5626,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,"Hi, Dad."
5627,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Kuei,"Look Bosco! The Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us! Aren't you excited? It's been a difficult week for me. My most trusted advisor, Long Feng, and his Dai Li agents tried to take control of Ba Sing Se from me."
5628,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.
5629,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Kuei,"But there is good news. As we speak, the Council of Five is meeting to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation this summer, on the day of a solar eclipse."
5630,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan.
5631,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,General How,"General Fong's base will serve as the launching point for the attack. In exactly two months, the army and navy will invade the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun."
5632,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Katara,"Or we could send in Momo to do some damage! 'Cause, the ... sorry."
5633,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,General How,All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the plan.
5634,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Katara,"I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How."
5635,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,"Uhhh ... hello? You're Guru Pathik, right? The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?"
5636,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso.
5637,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,"In your note, you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State. How?"
5638,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world. And the first step to gaining balance begins with this. Drink up!"
5639,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!
5640,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,That's because it is! Yum yum!
5641,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Yu,I believe we need to go right!
5642,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Xin Fu,What are you talking about? The Beifong Estate's this way!
5643,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Yu,I'm quite certain you're mistaken.
5644,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Toph,Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second? I got to go to the bathroom!
5645,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Yu,"Oooh ... uhhh, okay, but make it quick!"
5646,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Xin Fu,What's wrong with you?
5647,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Yu,"Ooh, very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me!"
5648,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Toph,Let me out of here so I can kick both your butts!
5649,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Xin Fu,"Quit your banging! You might think you're the greatest earthbender in the world, but even you can't bend metal!"
5650,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,"We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls."
5651,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Ty Lee,Mai finally gets to wear make-up that's not totally depressing?
5652,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,"I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom. For one hundred years, the Fire Nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside. But now we're on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves."
5653,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Ty Lee,"Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that about you."
5654,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,"From the inside, we're in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li controls Ba Sing Se."
5655,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras."
5656,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,What are chakras?
5657,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics. The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras."
5658,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?
5659,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Exactly. If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek. And then what happens?"
5660,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,The creek can't flow?
5661,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Yes. But, if we open the ponds between the pools ..."
5662,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,The energy flows!
5663,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck. Be warned, opening the chakras is an intense experience, and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open. Are you ready?"
5664,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,I'll do whatever it takes.
5665,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you."
5666,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek. You have opened your Earth Chakra!"
5667,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,Next is the ...
5668,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Water Chakra?
5669,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a guru too! This chakra deals with pleasure and is blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt with burdens you so. What do you blame yourself for?"
5670,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,I ran away. I hurt all of those people.
5671,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself."
5672,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Hakoda,This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the Fire Nation ships from getting through.
5673,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Bato,Your father invented tangle mines himself.
5674,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,"Destructive? Buoyant? And ... Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!"
5675,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Hakoda,"Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed. When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship. I call it the ""stink and sink."""
5676,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,"Good one, Dad!"
5677,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Bato,You're definitely your father's son.
5678,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Warrior,"Hakoda, our scouts have spotted four Fire Nation ships!"
5679,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Hakoda,"Bato, get these mines loaded up! The rest of you men, prepare for battle!"
5680,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,"Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad?"
5681,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Hakoda,"Aren't you listening? I said, ""The rest of you men, get ready for battle""."
5682,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,"Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop? Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you."
5683,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Zuko,"Congratulations, Uncle."
5684,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,I am very thankful.
5685,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Zuko,You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.
5686,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,No. I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know.
5687,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Zuko,Now let's make these people some tea!
5688,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,"Yes, let's make some tea!"
5689,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Third is the Fire Chakra, located in the stomach."
5690,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.
5691,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Good one! Moving on. This chakra deals with willpower, and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of? What are your biggest disappointments in yourself?"
5692,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,I'm never going to firebend again. I can't.
5693,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender. Hmmm ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping bison."
5694,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,"Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles?"
5695,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Mai,I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone could fight in this.
5696,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Ty Lee,Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes.
5697,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Mai,"How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King? If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm going to throw up."
5698,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Ty Lee,Princess Azula promised we would go back to the Fire Nation as soon as we captured the Avatar. We just have to be patient.
5699,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Mai,Shush up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation?
5700,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Ty Lee,Sorry!
5701,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,"Good work, girls. I'm sure the Dai Li will deliver the message."
5702,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love and is blocked by grief. Lay all your grief out in front of you.
5703,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"You have indeed felt a great loss. But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us. The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love."
5704,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,Let the pain flow away. Very good.
5705,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,"Can I have some onion-banana juice, please?"
5706,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"The fifth in the chain is the Sound Chakra, located in the throat. It deals with truth and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves."
5707,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Because I never wanted to be.
5708,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept that you are the Avatar. Very good, Aang. You have opened the chakra of truth."
5709,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same."
5710,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Like the four nations.
5711,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Yes. We are all one people, but we live as if divided."
5712,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,We're all connected. Everything is connected.
5713,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"That's right! Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined."
5714,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Toph,"Come on, metal. Budge! Wooo! Toph, you rule."
5715,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Katara,"What do you say, Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king? Table for two, please."
5716,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Zuko,"Uncle! I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee!"
5717,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,I'm brewing as fast as I can!
5718,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,"This is the last chakra, isn't it?"
5719,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able to go in and out of the Avatar State at will and when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions."
5720,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Let's do this.
5721,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"The Thought Chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy, and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world. Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river, forgotten."
5722,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,What? Why would I let go of Katara? I ... I love her!
5723,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe."
5724,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago that was a good thing!
5725,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,You must learn to let go.
5726,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Katara,"Thank goodness you're here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle! We have to tell the Earth King right away!"
5727,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,"Oh, don't worry, I'll be sure to let him know."
5728,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,"I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara."
5729,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Surrender yourself."
5730,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,"Okay, I'll try."
5731,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,Now think of your attachments and let them go. Let the pure cosmic energy flow.
5732,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Aang,Katara's in danger! I have to go!
5733,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Pathik,"No, Aang! By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra! If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!"
5734,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Yu,It's another one her tricks!
5735,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Xin Fu,There's a giant hole in the box! How is that a trick!?
5736,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Toph,It's not! It's the real deal!
5737,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Toph,I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!
5738,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Xin Fu,"I'm going to be stuck in here forever with you, aren't I?"
5739,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Yu,I have to go the bathroom.
5740,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Hakoda,Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?
5741,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,"You don't know how much this means to me, Dad. I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am."
5742,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Hakoda,"Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you and I've always known you're a great warrior."
5743,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,Really?
5744,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Hakoda,Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left?
5745,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Sokka,This can't be good news.
5746,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here? You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way!
5747,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Long Feng,"But you're not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you, Princess Azula of the Fire Nation?"
5748,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,What do you want?
5749,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Long Feng,I want to make a deal. It's time that I regain control of Ba Sing Se and you have something I need.
5750,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,Oh?
5751,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Long Feng,The Earth King's trust.
5752,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,Why should I help you?
5753,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Long Feng,Because I can get you the Avatar.
5754,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Azula,I'm listening ...
5755,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Royal messenger,A message from the Royal Palace.
5756,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,I ... I can't believe it!
5757,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Zuko,"What is it, Uncle?"
5758,1,The Guru,Earth,2,39,Iroh,Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King!
5759,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?"
5760,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,"I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help."
5761,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time. What is that?
5762,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,Need a ride?
5763,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"The Earth King and the Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death. This coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government. If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, I will snuff it out. That is all."
5764,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Ty Lee,"Nice speech, Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way."
5765,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Mai,Yeah. I thought you were going to make that one guy pee his pants.
5766,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and uncle."
5767,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,"Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing."
5768,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,"It sure is, Uncle."
5769,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Toph,So how did it go with the guru? Did you master the Avatar State?
5770,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,Uh ...
5771,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Pathik,"If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!"
5772,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"Aang, are you okay?"
5773,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,I'm great! It went great with the guru. I completely mastered the Avatar State. Yeah.
5774,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,What's taking so long?
5775,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,Maybe the Earth King overslept.
5776,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,Something's not right.
5777,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,It's tea time!
5778,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,Azula!
5779,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"Have you met the Dai Li? They're earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that's ''so'' firebender. I just love it."
5780,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,"Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname ""The Dragon of the West""?"
5781,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle. ''"
5782,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,"It's more of a demonstration, really."
5783,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,Come on! You'll be fine!
5784,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,No! I'm tired of running! It's time I faced Azula!
5785,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,You're ''so'' dramatic. What? Are you going to challenge me to an Agni Kai?
5786,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,Yes! I challenge you!
5787,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,No thanks.
5788,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Kuei,Katara's fine. You have nothing to worry about.
5789,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,"But, in my vision, I felt so sure she was in trouble."
5790,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Kuei,"Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion, and since then, she been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors."
5791,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"See, Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now talking about make-up or something."
5792,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,Okay. Maybe you're right.
5793,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Kuei,"Believe me, if there was any danger at all, Bosco's animal instincts would sense it."
5794,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Dai Li agent,You've got company.
5795,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,Zuko!
5796,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,Momo!
5797,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Toph,There's no one else here.
5798,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,Katara ''is'' in trouble! I knew it!
5799,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"Oh, no!"
5800,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Toph,"Wait! Someone's at the door. Actually, I know who it is. It's an old friend of mine. Glad to see you're okay."
5801,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,I need your help.
5802,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,You guys know each other?
5803,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Toph,I met him in the woods once and knocked him down. Then he gave me some tea and some very good advice.
5804,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,May I come in? Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.
5805,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,She must have Katara.
5806,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,She has captured my nephew as well.
5807,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,"Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko."
5808,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"Whoa there! You lost me at ""Zuko""."
5809,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,I know how you must feel about my nephew. But believe me when I tell you that there is ''good'' inside him.
5810,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"""Good inside him"" isn't enough! Why don't you come back when it's ''outside'' him too, okay?"
5811,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,Katara's in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance.
5812,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,I brought someone along who might help us.
5813,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Captured agent,Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup! They're going to overthrow the Earth King!
5814,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,My sister! Where are they keeping Katara?
5815,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Captured agent,"In the Crystal Catacombs of Old Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace."
5816,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Head of the Dai Li,The movements of the Earth King and all the generals have been plotted out step-by-step.
5817,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Long Feng,Good. And the Fire Nation princess is cooperating?
5818,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Head of the Dai Li,"Oh, yes. More than cooperating. She's really taken charge. She's terrifying and inspirational at the same time. It's hard to explain."
5819,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,"Why did they throw you in here? Oh, wait, let me guess. It's a trap. So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches!"
5820,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,You're a terrible person! You know that? Always following us! Hunting the Avatar! Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!
5821,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,You don't know what you're talking about!
5822,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,I don't? How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through! Me personally! The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.
5823,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,I'm sorry. That's something we have in common.
5824,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Toph,"Well, what'd you know? There ''is'' an ancient city down there. But it's deep."
5825,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk, no offense."
5826,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,None taken.
5827,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup.
5828,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,"So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea!"
5829,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?
5830,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,"Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this ''great'' power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love. And I just couldn't."
5831,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.
5832,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,"What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State, what if I'm not powerful enough?"
5833,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,"I don't know the answer. Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, you will come to a better place."
5834,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,There's General How!
5835,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,How,What's going on here?!
5836,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Dai Li agent,You're under house arrest.
5837,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,The coup is happening right now! We've gotta warn the Earth King!
5838,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,Thank goodness we're in time!
5839,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Kuei,In time for what?
5840,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Ty Lee,"Yeah. What are you in time for, cutie?"
5841,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki."
5842,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Ty Lee,Who?
5843,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Toph,They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!
5844,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Mai,Sorry to disappoint you.
5845,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Ty Lee,"Oooh, it's like we're dancing together!"
5846,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,This fight is over.
5847,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,Get them all out of my sight.
5848,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Long Feng,"Now comes the part where I double cross you. Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation princess! I said arrest her! What is wrong with you?!"
5849,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,It's because they haven't made up their minds. They're waiting to see how this is going to end.
5850,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Long Feng,What are you talking about?
5851,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing, so you've had to struggle, and connive, and claw your way to power. But true power, the divine right to rule, is something you're born with. The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne, and which one is going to be bowing down. But I know, and you know. Well?"
5852,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Long Feng,You've beaten me at my own game.
5853,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,Don't flatter yourself! You were never even a player.
5854,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,I'm sorry I yelled at you before.
5855,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,It doesn't matter.
5856,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,"It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face."
5857,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,My face? I see.
5858,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,"No, no, that's-that's not what I mean."
5859,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,"It's okay. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark."
5860,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,Maybe you could be free of it.
5861,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,What?
5862,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,I have healing abilities.
5863,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,"It's a scar, it can't be healed."
5864,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,"This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important. I don't know if it would work, but ..."
5865,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,Aang!
5866,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,"Aang, I knew you would come."
5867,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,"Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar?"
5868,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,"Saving you, that's what."
5869,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,"Zuko, it's time we talked. Go help you other friends. We'll catch up with you."
5870,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,"Why, Uncle?"
5871,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,"You're not the man you used to be, Zuko. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good."
5872,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle. But Zuko, ''Prince'' Zuko, you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?"
5873,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,Release him immediately.
5874,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"It's not too late for you, Zuko. You can still redeem yourself."
5875,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.
5876,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"Why don't you let ''him'' decide, Uncle? I need you, Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day, this glorious day in Fire Nation history, and the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have Father's love. You will have everything you want."
5877,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,"Zuko, I am begging you. Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want."
5878,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,You are free to choose.
5879,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,We've got to find Sokka and Toph.
5880,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Toph,See any Dai Li agents nearby?
5881,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,"Nope, all clear."
5882,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Sokka,Let's go.
5883,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Kuei,I'm not leaving without Bosco!
5884,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Katara,I thought you had changed!
5885,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,I have changed.
5886,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Ty Lee,"Come on, it's easy. You just walk on your front paws instead of your rear ones. Like this."
5887,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Toph,That ''is'' a nice trick.
5888,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Mai,Just take the bear.
5889,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Kuei,Bosco!
5890,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,There's too many.
5891,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Pathik,The only way is to let her go.
5892,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Aang,"I'm sorry, Katara."
5893,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Iroh,You've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as I can!
5894,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"We've done it, Zuko. It's taken a hundred years, but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se."
5895,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,I betrayed Uncle.
5896,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"No, he betrayed you. Zuko, when you return home, Father will welcome you as a war hero."
5897,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Zuko,But I don't have the Avatar. What if Father doesn't restore my honor?
5898,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Azula,"He doesn't need to, Zuko. Today, you restored your own honor."
5899,1,The Crossroads of Destiny,Earth,2,40,Kuei,The Earth Kingdom ... has fallen.
5900,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,What happened? Oh no!
5901,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Pipsqueak,You hear something? He's awake! Stop! Wait!
5902,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,Momo?
5903,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,Twinkle Toes! That's got to be you!
5904,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"Aang, you're awake!"
5905,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,Are you sure? I feel like I'm dreaming.
5906,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,You're not dreaming. You're finally awake.
5907,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,Sokka?
5908,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,"Uh-oh, somebody catch him, he's going to-"
5909,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Mai,Aren't you cold?
5910,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,"I've got a lot on my mind. It's been so long, over three years since I was home. I wonder what's changed. I wonder how ''I've'' changed."
5911,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Mai,"I just asked if you were cold, I didn't ask for your whole life story. Stop worrying."
5912,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one who's completely out of it?
5913,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"You need to take it easy, okay? You got hurt pretty bad. I like your hair."
5914,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I have hair? How long was I out?
5915,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,A few weeks.
5916,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,Everything okay?
5917,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"We're fine, Dad."
5918,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,"I'm Hakoda, Katara and Sokka's father."
5919,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"He knows who you are. I just called you ""Dad"", didn't I?"
5920,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,I guess you're right.
5921,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda."
5922,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,It's an honor to meet you.
5923,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"Great, great, so now you guys have finally met. So would you mind giving us a little privacy?"
5924,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,Of course.
5925,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,Are you mad at your dad or something?
5926,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"What, not at all. Why would you say that?"
5927,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,Maybe we should go upstairs. You need a healing session.
5928,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,Tell me where the pain feels most intense.
5929,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"Mmm, a little higher. Uhhh!"
5930,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"Wow, you're definitely in the right area there."
5931,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. Let me just see if I can-
5932,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was ''gone''! But you brought me back."
5933,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don't know what I did exactly.
5934,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,You saved me.
5935,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,You need to rest.
5936,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Li,"Your Princess Azula, clever and beautiful, disguised herself as the enemy and entered the Earth Kingdom's Capital. In Ba Sing Se, she found her brother Zuko, and together they faced the Avatar ..."
5937,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Lo and Li,And the Avatar fell! And the Earth Kingdom fell!
5938,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Li,Azula's agents quickly overtook the entire city. They went to Ba Sing Se's great walls ...
5939,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Lo and Li,And brought them down!
5940,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Li,"The armies of the Fire Nation surged through the walls and swarmed over Ba Sing Se, securing our victory."
5941,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Lo and Li,Now the heroes have returned home!
5942,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Lo,"Your princess, Azula ..."
5943,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Li,"And after three long years, your prince has returned ..."
5944,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Lo and Li,Zuko!
5945,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety. We flew back to Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men. The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone. Well, not completely alone. Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise. Since then we've been traveling west. We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us."
5946,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,So what now?
5947,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,We've been working on a modified version of the invasion plan.
5948,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,It's ''Sokka's'' invasion plan.
5949,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,"Yes, Sokka's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation vulnerable."
5950,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.
5951,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Pipsqueak,"Good to see you again, Aang!"
5952,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage! We have a secret... You!"
5953,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,Me?
5954,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead! Isn't that great?"
5955,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible!
5956,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"No, it's great! It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore! And even better, they won't be expecting you on the Day of Black Sun!"
5957,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up!"
5958,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I'll handle this. The Avatar is back.
5959,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"Aang, wait! Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation!"
5960,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,Everyone just stay calm. Bato and I will take care of this.
5961,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I hate not being able to do anything.
5962,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,"Hopefully, you won't need to."
5963,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Fire Navy officer,"Commander, why are you off course? All Western Fleet ships are supposed to be moving toward Ba Sing Se to support the occupation!"
5964,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,"Actually, we're from the Eastern Fleet. We have orders to deliver some cargo."
5965,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Fire Navy officer,"Ahhh ... Eastern Fleet. Well, nice of Admiral Chan to let us know he was sending one of his ships our way."
5966,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Bato,"I'm sure Admiral Chan meant no disrespect, sir."
5967,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Fire Navy officer,"I mean, how hard is it to write a quick note and send a hawk our way?"
5968,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,"Next time, we'll send two hawks to make sure you get the message."
5969,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Guard,Sir ... Admiral Chan has been on leave for two months at Ember Island.
5970,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,They know!
5971,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,"You seem so downcast. Has Mai gotten to you already? Though actually, Mai has been in a strangely good mood lately."
5972,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,"I haven't seen Dad yet. I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished."
5973,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,So what?
5974,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,"So, I didn't capture the Avatar."
5975,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,Who cares? The Avatar is dead ... unless you think he somehow miraculously survived.
5976,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,This is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole. It has special properties so I've been saving it for something important.
5977,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,No. There's no way he could have survived.
5978,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,"Well, then I'm sure you have nothing to worry about."
5979,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,Load the Toph!
5980,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,I'm gonna give us some cover!
5981,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I just can't stand by and do nothing!
5982,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"Aang, no! You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret! Just let us handle this."
5983,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,Fine.
5984,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,How are we doing?
5985,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"Things couldn't get much worse. The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?"
5986,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,You make it too easy!
5987,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"Thank you, the universe!"
5988,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,"Hey, Aang! We're going into town to find some dinner."
5989,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner's a good idea."
5990,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"Here, tie this around your head. It will cover your arrow."
5991,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly!
5992,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,"Aang, come on. Be practical."
5993,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up to you. I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much. You don't want people to think you failed.
5994,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail!"
5995,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"Aang, that's not true."
5996,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,It ''is'' true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there! But I lost. And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good.
5997,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"It's not for good. Remember, there's still a plan. The invasion!"
5998,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"And I hate the invasion plan, too! I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes! I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord. But now I know I need to do it alone."
5999,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,Aang ...
6000,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"Katara, please! Just go ... please."
6001,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,Is there anything you need?
6002,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back.
6003,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,I brought you some food! Oh no ...
6004,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Bato,I'll leave you two alone.
6005,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,"What's wrong, Katara?"
6006,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,He left.
6007,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,What?
6008,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility."
6009,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,Maybe that's his way of being brave.
6010,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid! We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too? How can he just leave us behind?"
6011,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,"You're talking about me too, aren't you?"
6012,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"How could you leave us, Dad? I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you."
6013,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,"I'm so sorry, Katara."
6014,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I'm so sad and angry and hurt!"
6015,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Hakoda,"I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire world. I thought about you every day when I was gone and every night when I went to sleep, I would lie awake missing you so much it would ache."
6016,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Ozai,"I am proud of you, Prince Zuko. I am proud because you and your sister conquered Ba Sing Se. I am proud because when your loyalty was tested by your treacherous uncle, you did the right thing and captured the traitor. And I am proudest of all of your most legendary accomplishment: you slayed the Avatar."
6017,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,What did you hear?
6018,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Ozai,Azula told me everything. She said she was amazed and impressed at your power and ferocity at the moment of truth.
6019,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,A blockade.
6020,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,Why'd you do it?
6021,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,You're going to have to be a little more specific.
6022,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,Why did you tell Father that I was the one who killed the Avatar?
6023,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,Can't this wait until the morning?
6024,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,It. Can't.
6025,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,"Fine. You seemed so worried about how Father would treat you because you hadn't captured the Avatar. I figured if I gave you the credit, you'd have nothing to worry about."
6026,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,But why?
6027,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,Call it a generous gesture. I wanted to thank you for your help and I was happy to share the glory.
6028,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,You're lying.
6029,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,If you say so ...
6030,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Zuko,"You have another motive for doing this, I just haven't figured out what it is."
6031,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Azula,"Please Zuko, what ulterior motive could I have? What could I possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar? Unless, somehow, the Avatar was actually alive. All that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you said it yourself, that was impossible. Sleep well, Zuzu."
6032,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I'm not gonna make it. I failed. Roku?
6033,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Roku,"You haven't failed, Aang."
6034,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"But everyone thinks I'm dead again. They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war. I'm letting the whole world down."
6035,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Roku,"If anyone is to blame for the state of the world, it is me. I should have seen this war coming and prevented it. You inherited my problems and my mistakes. But I believe you are destined to redeem me and save the world."
6036,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I don't know.
6037,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Yue,"You already saved the world. And you'll save the world again, but you can't give up."
6038,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,You're right. I won't give up.
6039,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,You're okay!
6040,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,I have so much to do.
6041,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Katara,"I know, but you'll have our help."
6042,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,"You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you?"
6043,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,What about the invasion?
6044,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Sokka,We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse.
6045,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Toph,"Hey! What's ... oh, it's your glider."
6046,1,The Awakening,Fire,3,41,Aang,"It's okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive."
6047,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Guard,Who's there?!
6048,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,I think I see a cave below.
6049,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,Sh! Keep quiet!
6050,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut."
6051,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Toph,"Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in."
6052,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Hey, we're in enemy territory. Those are enemy birds."
6053,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Well, this is it. This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins. Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ..."
6054,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,"Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes."
6055,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. If we get Fire Nation disguises, we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave."
6056,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Toph,"Plus, they have real food out there. Does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers?"
6057,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes."
6058,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,I don't know about this. These clothes belong to somebody.
6059,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,I call the silk robe!
6060,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit!
6061,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Ta-dah! Normal kid.
6062,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Toph,"Hm ... I should probably wear shoes. But then I won't be able to see as well. Sorry, shoes! Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender."
6063,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,How do I look?
6064,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Uh ... your mom's necklace.
6065,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,"Oh, oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it?"
6066,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, ""stay flamin'"". Greetings, my good hotman."
6067,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Fire Nation man,"Uh, hi. I guess ..."
6068,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Oh, we're going to a meat place?"
6069,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat. Even the meat!"
6070,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman.
6071,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Male soldier,It's over. We caught you.
6072,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Who, me?"
6073,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Male soldier,"It couldn't be more obvious that you don't belong here. Next time you play hooky, you might wanna take off your school uniform."
6074,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Kwan,Oh. Is this a new mind ready for molding?
6075,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,That's right. Let the molding begin.
6076,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Kwan,Wait a minute. You're not from the Fire Nation. Clearly you're from the colonies.
6077,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Yeah, the colonies, of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom."
6078,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Kwan,"Your etiquette is terrible. In the homeland, we bow to our elders. Like so."
6079,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Sorry, ma'am."
6080,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Kwan,And we don't wear head coverings indoors.
6081,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Um ... I have a scar. It's really embarrassing.
6082,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Kwan,"Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you ""Mannerless Colony Slob""?"
6083,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Just ""slob"" is fine. Or, uh, Kuzon."
6084,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun."
6085,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,On Ji,Don't let the headmaster catch you with that monkey.
6086,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,What monkey?
6087,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,On Ji,"Don't worry, I'm not a tattletale. My name's On Ji. I like your headband, by the way."
6088,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Hide,"On Ji, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid."
6089,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Wow. You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.
6090,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Hide,"That's right. Now listen, friend. I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly. On Ji is my girlfriend. Don't forget it."
6091,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,It was nice meeting you.
6092,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Shoji,"I don't believe it, he didn't beat you up. Not even a little."
6093,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,I guess I'm just lucky.
6094,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Shoji,We were on our way to play hide and explode. You wanna come?
6095,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,I'd love to.
6096,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,Where have you been? We've been worried sick.
6097,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,I got invited to play with some kids after school.
6098,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,After ''what''?!
6099,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow."
6100,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,Enrolled in ''what''?!
6101,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Guard,You again? Stop where you are! Prince Zuko ...
6102,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,"I'm going in for a visit. You're going to stand guard here, and ''no one'' is going to know about this. Uncle, it's me."
6103,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible."
6104,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Toph,"Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for?"
6105,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai. And here's one that I made out of noodles!"
6106,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous."
6107,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow.
6108,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days."
6109,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Flamey-O, hotman!"
6110,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,Flamey-O?
6111,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,"You brought this on yourself you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero! You have no right to judge me, Uncle. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me. You're not going to say anything? You're a crazy old man! You're crazy! And if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter!"
6112,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Kwan,Good morning class. Recite the Fire Nation oath.
6113,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Class,"My life I give to my country, with my hands I fight for Fire Lord Ozai and our forefathers before him."
6114,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Fire Lord ... forefathers ...
6115,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Class,"With my mind I seek ways to better my country, and with my feet may our March of Civilization continue."
6116,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah."
6117,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Kwan,"Since it's obviously ''hilarious'' to mock our national oath, we'll begin with a pop quiz on our great March of Civilization. Question one: What year did Fire Lord Sozin battle the Air Nation army? Kuzon?"
6118,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.
6119,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Kwan,"Well, I don't know how ''you'' could possibly know more than our national history book. Unless you were there a hundred years ago."
6120,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,I'll just write down my best guess.
6121,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Music teacher,Kuzon?
6122,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist."
6123,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Music teacher,"No, child. That hullabaloo going on with your feet. Is that a nervous disorder?"
6124,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right?"
6125,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Shoji,"Not really, no."
6126,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Music teacher,''Dancing'' is not conducive to a proper learning environment. Young people must have rigid discipline and order.
6127,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,But what about expressing yourself?
6128,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Music teacher,"I know sometimes we're so ruled by our love for our nation that we can't control our own bodies. If you must, you may march in place quietly next time the urge hits you."
6129,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,On Ji,"Uh, hi, Kuzon. I really liked that crazy dance you were doing."
6130,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Thanks On Ji. I could show it to you again if you like. Ah!
6131,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Hide,"What'd you say, colony trash? You're gonna show her something?"
6132,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Just some dance movements.
6133,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Hide,"Nobody shows my On Ji anything, especially movements!"
6134,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,Picking fights on your second day? We need to have a conference to discuss your punishment. Bring your parents to my office after school.
6135,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Parents? But-
6136,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,Don't be late!
6137,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,"Thank you for coming, Mr. and Mrs ..."
6138,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Fire. Wang Fire. This is my wife, Sapphire."
6139,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,Sapphire Fire. Nice to meet you.
6140,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,"Mr. and Mrs ... Fire, your son has been enrolled here for two days and he's already causing problems. He's argued with his history teacher, disrupted music class, and roughed up my star pupil."
6141,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon.
6142,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce! Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!"
6143,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,That's what I like to hear.
6144,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Mai,Orange is such an awful color.
6145,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,You're so beautiful when you hate the world.
6146,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Mai,I don't hate you.
6147,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,I don't hate you too.
6148,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Azula,"Ahem. Zuko, could I have a word with you?"
6149,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,Can't you see we're busy?
6150,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Azula,"Oh Mai, Ty Lee needs your help untangling her braid."
6151,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Mai,Sounds pretty serious.
6152,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Azula,"So, I've heard you've been to visit your uncle fatso in the prison tower."
6153,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,That guard told you.
6154,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Azula,No. You did. Just now.
6155,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,"Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want, Azula?"
6156,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Azula,"Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, Dum-Dum."
6157,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"That settles it! No more school for you, young man!"
6158,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"I'm not ready to leave yet. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time."
6159,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Toph,Ha ha!
6160,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom."
6161,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?
6162,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"I'm gonna throw them, a secret dance party!"
6163,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,Go to your room!
6164,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so ... silly.
6165,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork!"
6166,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Toph,They're coming! Everyone stop bending.
6167,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back. I know, you got fancier feet than anybody. And six of 'em!"
6168,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's! Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving."
6169,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Shoji,Now what do we do?
6170,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,This is when you start dancing.
6171,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you."
6172,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Shoji,"Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon, but we don't do that here."
6173,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'. And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'."
6174,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Toph,Who knew Twinkle Toes could dance?
6175,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,"I brought you some komodo chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food. I admit it, I have everything I always wanted, but it's not as all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice. I think the Avatar is still alive, I ''know'' he's out there, I'm losing my mind. Please, Uncle, I'm so confused I need your help. Forget it, I'll solve it myself! Waste away in here for all I care!"
6176,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se.
6177,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Wow, they look pretty good together."
6178,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,"Eh, if that's what you like ..."
6179,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"Yeah, that's it! That's the sound of happy feet. All right, go with that! Everybody freestyle!"
6180,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,"I don't know, Aang. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to-"
6181,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Take my hand.
6182,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,Okay.
6183,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,"Aang, everyone's watching."
6184,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now.
6185,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,"It ''is'' a dancing party. You did the right thing by telling me, Hide."
6186,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Hide,"Anytime, Headmaster sir."
6187,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,He's the one we want! The boy with the headband!
6188,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,Uh-oh.
6189,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Shoji,Looking for me?
6190,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,That's not the one. He's here somewhere. Don't let him leave the cave!
6191,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,On Ji,Yes?
6192,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,On Ji,Who are you looking for?
6193,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Student,Over here.
6194,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Headmaster,Stop that! Stop that!
6195,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,"We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache now."
6196,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Oh, no I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin."
6197,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Toph,"Way to go, dancy pants. I think you really ''did'' help those kids, you taught them to be free."
6198,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Aang,"I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all."
6199,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Katara,"Well, that was some dance party Aang."
6200,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Sokka,"Flamey-O sir, flamey-O."
6201,1,The Headband,Fire,3,42,Zuko,"You're sure you weren't followed? I've heard about you. They say you're good at what you do, and even better at keeping secrets. The Avatar is alive. I want you to find him, and end him."
6202,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Momo! Oh Momo! Hahahahaha! You found me, buddy! Hey guys, I think this river's polluted."
6203,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,Pah! Plegh!
6204,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook! Get it? Like a fishing hook?"
6205,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,Too bad your skills aren't ''on'' the hook.
6206,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food, assuming that'll fit into Sokka's ''master'' schedule."
6207,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,Hmmm ... It's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today.
6208,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Hey, maybe we can get food there!"
6209,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Now you look just like a little hill with horns! Bye, buddy!"
6210,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,I don't feel anything. Where is the village?
6211,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,It's in the middle of the river!
6212,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,Sure is! My name's Dock. Mind if I ask who you are?
6213,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,We're um ... from the Earth Kingdom colonies.
6214,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"Wow ... Colonials. Hop on, I give you ride in the town."
6215,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,Why do you guys live on the river?
6216,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,Because we're a fishing town. At least that's how it was before the factory moved in. Army makes their metal there. Moved in a few years ago and started gunking up our river. Now our little village is struggling to survive.
6217,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,Thanks for the ride!
6218,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,Look at this place. It's so sad. We ''have'' to do something to help.
6219,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"No, we can't waste our time here. We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own."
6220,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,These people are starving! But you'd turn your back on them? How can you be so cold and heartless?
6221,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic. We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord."
6222,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,"Hey, loud mouths! Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about ""taking out the Fire Lord."""
6223,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first."
6224,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,I guess so.
6225,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,Let's just get what we need and go.
6226,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Hey, Dock. You work here too?"
6227,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,I'm not Dock. I'm Xu! Dock's my brother.
6228,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. The only difference is your hat.
6229,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,"Dock works on the docks. That's why we call him, ""Dock"", and I work in the shop, that's why they call me, ""Xu""!"
6230,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,I don't get it.
6231,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,"Me neither. What I can getcha? Hey, I'll give you a special deal. If you buy three fish, I'll give you a clam for free."
6232,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,We'll just take the fish. Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore?
6233,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"Hey, colonials! My brother says you need a lift."
6234,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Little boy,Can you spare some food?
6235,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,I wish I could help more.
6236,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track.
6237,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,"Finagle away, oh schedule master."
6238,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day."
6239,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,Forty''-three'' minutes?
6240,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse, which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!"
6241,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,Well ''I'm'' not waking up early.
6242,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.
6243,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,What?
6244,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,No way!
6245,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,Forget it!
6246,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time."
6247,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning."
6248,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,What's the matter Katara?
6249,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,I think Appa's sick.
6250,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,What? Appa's sick? That's awful!
6251,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,"Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much."
6252,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now. And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well."
6253,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.
6254,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy? His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara, can you heal him?"
6255,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town.
6256,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,"Is it just me, or does this place seem different?"
6257,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Yeah, are the people ... happier?"
6258,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?"
6259,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,"Ah, something amazing happened last night. Food was delivered to our village by a mysterious and wonderful person ... the Painted Lady."
6260,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,The Painted who now?
6261,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,The Painted Lady. She's part of our town's lore. They say she's a river spirit who watches over our town in times of need. I always thought she was just a legend. Until now.
6262,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All we need is medicine for our sick friend."
6263,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,"Medicine? Sorry, all the medicine we have goes to the factory. That's why there's so many sick people in our village."
6264,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.
6265,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,I guess you're right. You got any more food to sell?
6266,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,"Would you like the one-headed fish, or the two-headed fish?"
6267,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,Two-headed! What? You get more for your money that way!
6268,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Little boy,"Thank you, Painted Lady."
6269,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Hi, Dock. Is Xu around?"
6270,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,We need more food. Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better.
6271,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,"Oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe if you guys are lucky, the Painted Lady will visit you in the night, and heal your friend."
6272,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along."
6273,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Xu,"Yeah, maybe! You know, last night she visited us again. Healed most of our sick folks."
6274,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,Is that why this place seems so festive?
6275,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"Yep, it's all because of the Painted Lady."
6276,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit?
6277,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was."
6278,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are.
6279,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory."
6280,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like ..."
6281,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang and Sokka,Wooooooooo ...
6282,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"What's the matter, buddy? It's her! Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!"
6283,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule. Wait! But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine! I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends! Heeey! My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar."
6284,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Well, hello Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy."
6285,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Yeah, me too. I hate that. You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive."
6286,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Thank you, but-"
6287,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,You seem familiar too.
6288,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,A lot of people say that.
6289,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"No, you ''really'' seem familiar."
6290,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Look, I really should get going."
6291,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,Katara?
6292,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Hi, Aang."
6293,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,You're the Painted Lady? But how?
6294,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village. But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her."
6295,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait, is Appa even sick?"
6296,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine!"
6297,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people."
6298,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ..."
6299,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero!"
6300,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do."
6301,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,You wanna destroy this factory?
6302,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently."
6303,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Shhh! We don't wanna wake Sokka. Hi, Sokka, we were just out on a morning walk!"
6304,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Oh, really? A morning walk? I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him purpleising tongue berries! Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now!"
6305,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,And how long did you know about this?
6306,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Hey, I just found out this morning!"
6307,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,What's going on?
6308,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village!
6309,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,What did you do?
6310,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,I kind of destroyed their factory.
6311,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,You ''what''?
6312,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,It was ''your'' idea!
6313,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises! Did you even think this through? The army is gonna blame the villagers! They're headed there right now to get revenge!
6314,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Well, what was I supposed to do?"
6315,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,Leave! Do nothing!
6316,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"No, I will never, ''ever'' turn my back on people who need me! I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can."
6317,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Wait! I'm coming, too."
6318,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,I thought you didn't want to help.
6319,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"You need me, and I will never turn my back on you."
6320,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Sokka, you really do have a heart."
6321,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"He really does have a heart, doesn't he?"
6322,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Mung,"I thought we could live as neighbors, in peace. But I guess I was wrong. You steal our food, our medicine ... and then you destroy our factory."
6323,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Mung,"Oh, right, the mysterious Painted Lady did it. And I suppose she drew the army emblem on your containers, too. This is a town of thieves and liars! Where's your Painted Lady now? We're going to cure the world of this wretched village."
6324,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Mung,Light it again!
6325,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Female Fire Nation soldier,Look at that! Where's it coming from?
6326,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Male Fire Nation soldier,I don't know. Something strange is going on.
6327,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Little boy,It's the Painted Lady. She's coming.
6328,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Mung,There is no Painted Lady!
6329,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Female Fire Nation soldier,What is that sound?
6330,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Male Fire Nation soldier,Maybe it ''is'' her.
6331,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Mung,Do something! Stand your ground! I'll take care of you myself.
6332,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,Leave this village and ''never'' come back.
6333,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Little boy,I knew you'd come.
6334,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"Me and my brothers really owe you a lot. Hey, wait a minute! I know you! You're not the Painted Lady, you're that colonial girl!"
6335,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Little boy,"Yeah, you're the lady that gave me a fish."
6336,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,You've been tricking us. You're a waterbender!
6337,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her!"
6338,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"Sokka, it's okay. I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself."
6339,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"She's right, but what should we do?"
6340,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Toph,Maybe we can clean the river!
6341,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"Yeah, we can clean the river! Thank you. You know, you're not so bad for a waterbender."
6342,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Sokka,"You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?"
6343,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"No problem. Keeping my mouth shut is a personal specialty. My brother Xu, on the other hand, ohh, he's a blabbermouth."
6344,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Katara,"So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?"
6345,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"No, ma'am. I'm going to get my other brother, Bushi. He loves cleaning rivers. All right, I'm Bushi! Let's get some river cleaning done!"
6346,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"Aha, I knew it! I knew you were the same guy. You're the shop owner ''and'' the boat guy."
6347,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"Oh, you must be talking about my brothers, Dock and Xu."
6348,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Aang,"No, I just saw you! You switched hats and called yourself a different name!"
6349,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Dock,"Oh, you know who does that? My brother, Dock. He's crazy."
6350,1,The Painted Lady,Fire,3,43,Painted Lady,Thank you.
6351,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,"Wow, this is amazing to watch."
6352,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are.
6353,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,"Eh, you've seen nothing once, you've seen it a thousand times."
6354,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Oh man, you've ''never ''not seen anything like this."
6355,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,The fire is gonna destroy that town!
6356,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,Not if we can stop it!
6357,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,There's a creek over here. I'll bend the water onto the fire.
6358,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"Toph, let's make a trench to stop the fire from coming any closer."
6359,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,What should I do?
6360,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,Keep an eye on Momo.
6361,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"Sokka, stand clear!"
6362,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Right. Staying clear, got it."
6363,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"Good work, everybody."
6364,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Warden Poon,"Look at you, you're just a fat, disgusting old man. You do nothing, you say nothing, you just eat and roll around in your own filth like a pig. You're a disgrace."
6365,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night.
6366,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,"Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is that we don't get the hero worship anymore. I miss the love."
6367,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Boo-hoo, poor heroes."
6368,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.
6369,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, okay? I can't ''do'' anything."
6370,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,That's not true. No one can read a map like you.
6371,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,I can't read at all!
6372,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time? I mean, look at Katara's hair, right? What's up with that?"
6373,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,What? What's wrong with my hair?
6374,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,Nothing. I was just trying to ...
6375,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Look, I appreciate the effort, but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special and I'm ... not. I'm just the guy in the group who's regular."
6376,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,"I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know, none of us see you that way. I know something that's going to make you feel better."
6377,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,You do?
6378,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Shopping! Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling. Hey, how about these?"
6379,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"What do you think? Pretty slick, huh? All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword."
6380,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,What's a wind sword?
6381,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"It's where I get a sword handle and then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh."
6382,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,Yeah ... nice.
6383,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,I'll just stick to what I got.
6384,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,Ooh! ''That's'' what Sokka's talking about.
6385,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Weapons store shopkeeper,"You have a good eye. That's an original from Piandao, the greatest swordsmaster and sword maker in Fire Nation history. He lives in the big castle up the road from here."
6386,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"That's it! That's what you needed all along, Sokka."
6387,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,A sword?
6388,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"Not the sword, a master. We've all had masters to help us get better. You should see if you can study with Piandao."
6389,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,That's a great idea. I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku. Everyone needs a teacher.
6390,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,"I learned from badgermoles. They don't talk, but they're still good teachers."
6391,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"It would be nice to be a master sword fighter. All right, I'll talk to him."
6392,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Fat,Can I help you?
6393,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,I've come to train with the master.
6394,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Fat,You should know The Master turns almost everyone away. What did you bring him to prove your worth?
6395,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Well, uhh ..."
6396,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Fat,Right ... Let's get this over with.
6397,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword."
6398,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Sokka. That's an unusual name.
6399,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Oh, uh, really, uh where I come from, the Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name... for Fire Nation colonials."
6400,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Let me guess. You've come hundreds of miles from your little village where you're the best swordsman in town. And you think you deserve to learn from the master.
6401,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Well, actually, I've been all over the world."
6402,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Yep, here we go."
6403,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,And I know one thing for sure: I have a lot to learn.
6404,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,You're not doing a very good job of selling yourself.
6405,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth. But the truth is... I don't know if I am worthy."
6406,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Hm, I see. Well, then, let's find out together how worthy you are."
6407,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,I ''will'' train you.
6408,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,The first thing you must learn is that your weapon is an extension of yourself. You must think of it as another part of your own body.
6409,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,Like a second head.
6410,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Well, more like an extra-long, really sharp arm. The sword is a simple tool, but in the hands of a master it becomes the most versatile of weapons, and just as the imagination is limitless, so too are the possibilities of the sword."
6411,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,"I'm tapped out. I already picked my toes, twice."
6412,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,Twice?
6413,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,"The first time was for cleaning, but the second time's just for the sweet picking sensation!"
6414,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,Sokka's been in charge of the schedule. I'm not sure what we should be doing.
6415,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,"Plus, it's so hot today."
6416,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,How hot is it?
6417,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,I guess the jokes don't run in the family.
6418,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,"Oh, everyone's a critic."
6419,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,The warrior practices a variety of arts to keep his mind sharp and fluid. The first you will learn is calligraphy. Write your name.
6420,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"When you write your name, you stamp the paper with your identity. You must learn to use your sword to stamp your identity on a battlefield. Remember, you cannot take back a stroke of the brush, or a stroke of the sword."
6421,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,You are getting ink on your face.
6422,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"I am? I am! So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?"
6423,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Landscape painting teaches a warrior to hold the lay of the land in his mind.
6424,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"In battle, you only have an instant to take everything in."
6425,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Now, paint it."
6426,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,And no peeking.
6427,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,I'm finished!
6428,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,You added a rainbow.
6429,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Sokka.
6430,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Concentrate on what you're doing.
6431,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Rock gardening teaches the warrior to manipulate his surroundings and use them to his advantage.
6432,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Hm, manipulate them to my advantage ... oh!"
6433,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"I'll take a slice of lemon in mine, please."
6434,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Warden Poon,Crazy old man.
6435,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,"No, we're over on this island."
6436,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing. I miss Sokka.
6437,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,You've had a good first day of training.
6438,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,You messed things up in a very special way. You are ready for a real sword.
6439,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,No.
6440,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Your sword must be an extension of yourself. So tomorrow, you will make your own sword."
6441,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Choosing the correct material is the most important step in crafting a sword. You must trust your steel with your life. Choose carefully.
6442,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,I wouldn't have it any other way.
6443,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,Sokka's coming!
6444,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,Sokka!
6445,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,You're back!
6446,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,We missed you so much!
6447,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,Say something funny!
6448,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,I don't know. They missed you or something. I didn't care.
6449,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"Thanks. That warms my heart. Anyway, I need some help."
6450,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,We'll make a sword unlike any other in the world.
6451,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Sokka, when you first arrived, you were so unsure. You even seemed down on yourself. But I saw something in you right away. I saw a heart as strong as a lion turtle, and twice as big. And as we trained, it wasn't your skills that impressed me. No, it certainly wasn't your skills. You showed something beyond that. Creativity, versatility, intelligence ... these are the traits that define a great swordsman. And these are the traits that define you. You told me you didn't know if you were worthy, but I believe that you are more worthy than any man I have ever trained."
6452,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"I'm sorry, Master. You're wrong. I am not worthy. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not from the Fire Nation. I'm from the Southern Water Tribe. I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you. I'm sorry."
6453,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"I'm sorry, too."
6454,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"No, this is my fight, alone."
6455,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Warden Poon,"You used to be the pride of the Fire Nation. Our top general, the Dragon of the West. Now, look at you. Look what you've become."
6456,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Excellent! Using your superior agility against an older opponent ... smart.
6457,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Good use of terrain ... fighting from the high ground.
6458,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Yes, use your surroundings. Make them fight for you!"
6459,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,Very resourceful.
6460,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Excellent work, Sokka."
6461,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,I think I'm a little old to be fighting the Avatar.
6462,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"Oh, I've been around a while. You pick things up. Of course, I knew from the beginning that Sokka was Water Tribe. You might want to think of a better Fire Nation cover name. Try ""Lee."" There's a million ""Lees"". ."
6463,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Piandao,"The way of the sword doesn't belong to any one nation. Knowledge of the arts belongs to us all. Sokka, you must continue your training on your own. If you stay on this path, I know that one day you will become an even greater master than I am."
6464,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Fat,"Wait! The Master wanted you to have this, as something to remember him by."
6465,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,It's a Pai Sho tile.
6466,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Aang,The White Lotus. Huh.
6467,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Sokka,"I have no idea. Ooh, that reminds me! Toph, I thought you might like this since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before."
6468,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Toph,Sweet! Check this out.
6469,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,"You know, I don't think there's such a thing as ""space earth"". If it's from space, then it's not really ""earth""."
6470,1,Sokka's Master,Fire,3,44,Katara,I can't believe I missed you.
6471,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,I'm so excited to spend the weekend on Ember Island. It's going to be great to hang out on the beach and do nothing.
6472,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Doing nothing is a waste of time. We're being sent away on a forced vacation. I feel like a child.
6473,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Lighten up. So Dad wants to meet with his advisers alone, without anyone else around. Don't take it personally."
6474,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Doesn't your family have a house on Ember Island?
6475,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,That must have been fun!
6476,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,That was a long time ago.
6477,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo and Li,"Welcome to Ember Island, kids."
6478,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,It smells like old lady in here.
6479,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"Gee, I wonder why."
6480,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Who are these two beautiful women?
6481,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo,Can't you tell?
6482,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Li,It's Lo and me.
6483,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo,It's Li and me.
6484,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"Ooh, I love the seashell bedspread."
6485,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Are you serious? It looks like the beach threw up all over it.
6486,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Li,We know you're upset that you were forced to come here this weekend.
6487,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo,But Ember Island is a magical place. Keep an open mind.
6488,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Li,Give it a chance.
6489,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo and Li,And it can help you understand yourselves and each other.
6490,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo,The beach has a special way ...
6491,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Li,... of smoothing even the most ragged edges.
6492,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo and Li,Time to hit the beach!
6493,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Toph,"Aang, I know swimming is fun and all, but do you really think you should be exposing yourself like that? Cover up."
6494,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Aang,What? I'm wearing trunks.
6495,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Toph,I know. It's your tattoos I'm worried about. What if someone sees you?
6496,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Katara,There are walls all around us. It's completely safe.
6497,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Aang,Whoa! Let's go again!
6498,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Sure. Thanks.
6499,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Could you scooch just a little bit more to the- Perfect.
6500,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Here. This is for you.
6501,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Why would I want that?
6502,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"I saw it, and I thought it was pretty. Don't girls like stuff like this?"
6503,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Maybe stupid girls.
6504,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Forget it!
6505,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Wow! Thanks. This is ''so'' pretty.
6506,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Ahem! Shade. Shade!
6507,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"I thought, since it's so hot ... here."
6508,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Thanks. This is really ''refreshing''.
6509,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Hey, beach bums, we're playing next. Ty Lee, get over here, ''now''!"
6510,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"See that girl with the silly pigtails? When she runs toward the ball, there's just the slightest hesitation of her left foot. I'm willing to bet a childhood injury has weakened her. Keep serving the ball to her left, and we'll ''destroy'' her and the rest of her team. Dismissed."
6511,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,I'm having a party tonight. You should come by.
6512,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Sure. I love parties.
6513,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Uh ... What about me and my brother? Aren't you going to invite us? You don't know who we are, do you?"
6514,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,Don't you know who ''we'' are? We're Chan and Ruon-Jian.
6515,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,"But, fine, you're invited. Just so you know, though, some of the most important teenagers in the Fire Nation are gonna be at this party, so try and act normal."
6516,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,We'll do our best.
6517,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Why didn't you tell those guys who we were?
6518,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,I guess I was intrigued. I'm so used to people worshiping us.
6519,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,They should.
6520,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Yes, I know, and I love it. But, for once, I just wanted to see how people would treat us if they didn't know who we were."
6521,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Li,"Like waves washing away the footprints on the sand, Ember Island gives everyone a clean slate."
6522,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo,Ember Island reveals the true you.
6523,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Lo and Li,To the party!
6524,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,Um ... You're a little early. No one's here yet.
6525,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"I heard you telling someone you'd be partying from dusk 'till dawn. It's dusk, so we're here."
6526,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,But that's just an expression.
6527,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"We are the perfect party guests. We arrive right on time, because we are very punctual."
6528,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,"All right, listen. My dad's an admiral. He has no idea I'm having this party, so don't mess anything up."
6529,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"That's a sharp outfit, Chan. Careful. You could puncture the hull of an empire-class Fire Nation battleship, leaving ''thousands'' to drown at sea, because it's so sharp."
6530,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,Um ... thanks.
6531,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"He thinks he's so great. Well, what do you think of him?"
6532,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,I don't have any opinion about him. I hardly know him.
6533,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"You like him, don't you?"
6534,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"Look, i-it doesn't matter who I met first, 'cause I like you all."
6535,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"I don't know! I don't know! Oh, I'm glad you're here. Those boys won't leave me alone. I guess they all just like me too much."
6536,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Come on, Ty Lee. You can't be this ignorant."
6537,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,What are you talking about?
6538,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are. Okay, okay, calm down. I didn't mean what I said. Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little ... jealous."
6539,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"What? You're jealous of me? But you're the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world."
6540,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Well, you're right about all those things. But, for some reason, when I meet boys, they act as if I'm going to do something horrible to them."
6541,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"But you probably would do something horrible to them. I'm sure they're just intimidated by you. Okay, look, if you want a boy to like you, just look at him and smile a lot and laugh at everything he says even if it's not funny."
6542,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Well, that sounds really shallow and stupid ... Let's try it."
6543,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"Okay. Hey there, sweet sugar cakes. How you liking this party?"
6544,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,I'm bored.
6545,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,I know.
6546,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,I'm hungry.
6547,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,So what?
6548,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"So, find me some food."
6549,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Sure.
6550,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house."
6551,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,Is this your first time on Ember Island?
6552,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,No. I used to come here years ago.
6553,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,"It's a great place, if you like sand. Yeah, it's like, welcome to Sandy Land!"
6554,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,Your arms look ''so'' strong.
6555,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,"Yeah, I know. You're pretty."
6556,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,Uh ... I got to go.
6557,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"Hey, watch it! That food was for my cranky girlfriend!"
6558,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Stop talking to my girlfriend!
6559,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"Zuko, what is wrong with you?"
6560,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,What's wrong with ''me''?
6561,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Your temper is out of control. You blow up over every little thing. You're so impatient and hotheaded and angry!
6562,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"Well, at least I feel something, as opposed to you. You have no passion for anything! You're just a big blah!"
6563,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"It's over, Zuko. We're done."
6564,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,I was just leaving.
6565,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Chan,''Nice''.
6566,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Toph,"Guys, you're all gonna think I'm crazy, but it feels like a metal man is coming."
6567,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,I thought I'd find you here.
6568,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Those summers we spent here seem so long ago. So much has changed.
6569,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,Come down to the beach with me. Come on. This place is depressing.
6570,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Hey.
6571,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Where's your new boyfriend? Are you cold?
6572,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,I'm ''freezing''.
6573,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Sokka,This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?
6574,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Aang,We can't! Jump on Appa! I'll try to distract him!
6575,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Aang,I'm okay.
6576,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Toph,"Well, that was random."
6577,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Katara,I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are.
6578,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,What are you doing?
6579,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,What does it look like I'm doing?
6580,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"But, it's a painting of your family."
6581,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,I think you do.
6582,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business?"
6583,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,I know you.
6584,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"No, you don't. You're stuck in your little ""Ty Lee world"" where everything's great all the time."
6585,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"Zuko, leave her alone."
6586,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"""I'm so pretty. Look at me. I can walk on my hands. Whoo!"" Circus freak."
6587,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"Yes, I'm a circus freak. Go ahead and laugh all you want. You want to know ''why'' I joined the circus?"
6588,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,Here we go.
6589,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"Guess that explains why you need ten boyfriends, too."
6590,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"Attention issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so you're trying to make up for it now."
6591,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"Well, what's ''your'' excuse, Mai? You were an only child for fifteen years, but even with all that attention, your aura is this dingy, pasty, gray ..."
6592,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,I don't believe in auras.
6593,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"Yeah, you do not believe in anything."
6594,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"I'm sorry, too. I wish you ''would'' be high-strung and crazy for once instead of keeping all your feeling bottled up inside. She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that?"
6595,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't. I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted ... as long as I behaved and sat still, and didn't speak unless spoken to. My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. We had my dad's political career to think about."
6596,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Well, that's it, then. You have a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them, you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself."
6597,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,You want me to express myself? Leave me alone!
6598,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,I like it when you express yourself.
6599,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Don't touch me! I'm still mad at you.
6600,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"My life hasn't been that easy either, Mai."
6601,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Whatever. That doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.
6602,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"Calm down, you guys. This much negative energy is bad for your skin. You'll totally break out."
6603,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Bad skin? ''Normal'' teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my ''face''!
6604,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,"Sorry, Zuko, I ..."
6605,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"For so long I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home now, my dad talks to me. Ha! He even thinks I'm a hero. Everything should be perfect, right? I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why!"
6606,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"There's a simple question you need to answer, then. Who are you angry at?"
6607,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,No one. I'm just angry.
6608,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"Yeah, who are you angry at, Zuko?"
6609,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Everyone. I don't know.
6610,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,Is it Dad?
6611,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"No, no."
6612,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Your uncle?
6613,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,Me?
6614,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"No, no, n-no, no!"
6615,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,Then who? Who are you angry at?
6616,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Answer the question, Zuko."
6617,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,Talk to us.
6618,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,"Come on, answer the question."
6619,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Come on, answer it."
6620,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,Why?
6621,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Because I'm confused. Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.
6622,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,You're pathetic.
6623,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Mai,I know one thing I care about. I care about you.
6624,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone."
6625,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,"I guess you wouldn't understand, would you, Azula? Because you're just ''so'' perfect."
6626,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. My own mother thought I was a monster. She was right, of course, but it still hurt."
6627,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Ty Lee,What Lo and Li said came true. The beach did help us learn about ourselves. I feel all smoothed. I'll always remember this.
6628,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,You know what would make this trip ''really'' memorable?
6629,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Azula,"We've got some bad news, Chan."
6630,1,The Beach,Fire,3,45,Zuko,Party's over.
6631,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Aang, it's time you learn of my history with Fire Lord Sozin. You need to understand how the war began, if you want to know how to end it. Meet me on my home island on the day of the summer solstice."
6632,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,"Okay, Roku."
6633,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise. It will reveal your own destiny.
6634,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,There it is. That's Roku's home.
6635,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Katara,"But, there's nothing here."
6636,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Toph,"Yes, there is. An entire village, hundreds of houses ... all completely buried in ash."
6637,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Azula,"It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko. Make sure he gets your good side."
6638,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,"Wait, I need to ask you something. What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history?"
6639,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Azula,"Oh, Zuko, it's so strange how your mind works. Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course. He spent his early years secretly preparing for it. He was as patient as he was clever. He famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's Comet, and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world. In the end, he died a very old and successful man."
6640,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,But how did he die?
6641,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Azula,"Didn't you pay ''any'' attention in school, Zuko? He died peacefully, in his sleep. He was ancient."
6642,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,What does it mean?
6643,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the Dragonbone Catacombs.
6644,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,The final testimony of Fire Lord Sozin.
6645,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Come, Aang."
6646,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,Where're we going?
6647,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,To visit my past. Our shared past.
6648,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"As I feel my own life dimming, I can't help but think of a time when everything was so much brighter."
6649,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,I remember my friend.
6650,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Looks like I win again, Roku."
6651,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Are you kidding? The tree root did all the work. Nice one, Sozin."
6652,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Back then, he was just ''Prince'' Sozin. And he was my best friend."
6653,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,Say something to her.
6654,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,Love is hard when you are young.
6655,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,You don't have to tell me.
6656,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Don't worry, it gets better. Now, come with me. We have a party to attend."
6657,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,"Wait, whose party is it?"
6658,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Sozin and I shared many things, including a birthday."
6659,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,Did something happen to my father?
6660,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Fire Sage,"No, Prince Sozin. We are not here for you. We're here to announce the identity of the next Avatar. It is our honor to serve you, Avatar Roku."
6661,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,Soon the day came when my friend Roku had to leave the Fire Nation and face his destiny as the Avatar. He needed to travel the world so he could master the other elements.
6662,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Hey, why aren't you packed yet, all-powerful Avatar?"
6663,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Come on, show me how it's done using all four kinds of bending."
6664,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"I started packing, but then the Fire Sages told me I won't need any worldly possessions anymore."
6665,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,Oh.
6666,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,It happened so fast. Everything's gonna be different now.
6667,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Here, hope you're at least allowed to have this."
6668,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,But this is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn by the Crown Prince.
6669,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,I want you to have it.
6670,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Katara,Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World?
6671,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sokka,"As a matter of fact, they do not."
6672,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,"Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple!"
6673,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,This was the first stop on my Avatar journey.
6674,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,It was the place where I was trained to master airbending.
6675,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,And also where I met an old friend of yours: Monk Gyatso.
6676,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,No way!
6677,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Hey, Gyatso, you wanna see a new glider trick?"
6678,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Gyatso,Check this out!
6679,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,He's air surfing! I can't believe I never thought of that.
6680,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,That's amazing! I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was!
6681,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Some friendships are so strong, they can even transcend lifetimes."
6682,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"After my years mastering airbending, I traveled to the Northern Water Tribe."
6683,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Waterbending was especially challenging for me. But in time, I mastered it as well."
6684,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,I moved on to the Earth Kingdom.
6685,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"My earthbending master, Sud, was uncompromising, stubborn, and blunt ..."
6686,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,... And a lifelong friend.
6687,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,It was bitter work ... but the results were worth it.
6688,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Twelve long years passed before I saw my friend again. When Roku returned, he was a fully realized Avatar, and I had changed as well."
6689,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Sozin! Or should I say, Fire Lord!"
6690,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Customarily, my subjects bow before greeting me. But you're the exception."
6691,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"After all these years, he was still my best friend. And a few months later, he was my best man."
6692,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,"Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you're alive!"
6693,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Ta Min. I was persistent. When love is real, it finds a way. And being the Avatar doesn't hurt your chances with the ladies, either."
6694,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"On wedding days, we look to the future with optimism and joy. I had my own vision for a brighter future."
6695,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Ta Min,"It's not very traditional, but, okay."
6696,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,What's on your mind?
6697,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,I've been thinking hard about the state of the world lately.
6698,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Sozin, it is my wedding! Have a cookie, dance with someone, lighten up!"
6699,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"I know, I know, but just hear me out. Right from the start, I was destined to be Fire Lord. And although we didn't always know it, you were destined to be the Avatar. It's an amazing stroke of fate we know each other so well, isn't it? Together, we could do ... ''anything''."
6700,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Yeah, we could."
6701,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Our nation is enjoying an unprecedented time of peace and wealth. Our people are happy, and we're so fortunate in so many ways."
6702,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,Where are you going with this?
6703,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"I've been thinking, we should share this prosperity with the rest of the world. In our hands is the most successful empire in history. It's time we expanded it."
6704,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,No! The four nations are meant to be just that: four.
6705,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Roku, you haven't even stopped to consider the possibilities."
6706,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,There are no possibilities. This is the last I want to hear about this.
6707,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"That was my first real test as the Avatar. Unfortunately, it was many years before I learned that Sozin had gone ahead with his plan, despite my warning."
6708,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"I've seen the colonies, Sozin. How dare you occupy Earth Kingdom territory!"
6709,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"How dare you, a citizen of the Fire Nation, address your Fire Lord this way. Your loyalty is to our nation first. Anything less makes you a traitor."
6710,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Don't do this, Sozin. Don't challenge me. It will only end badly. It's over."
6711,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"I'm sparing you, Sozin. I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship. But I warn you. Even a single step out of line will result in your ''permanent'' end."
6712,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Sozin and I didn't speak or see each other for twenty-five years after our battle. I spent most of my spare time here, at my home."
6713,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,Let's go!
6714,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,Roku's island was a hundred miles away. But I could still feel it rumbling and see the black plume of smoke. I had never seen anything like this catastrophe.
6715,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,"This is amazing, Roku! You're battling a volcano, and you're winning."
6716,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Unfortunately, my success didn't last long, Aang. There was no way I could do it all."
6717,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Battling the elements was hard enough. I had to do it while I could barely breathe. The poisonous, volcanic gases were overwhelming."
6718,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,It's all right Fang! Get out of here! I'm fine!
6719,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Need a hand, old friend?"
6720,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,Sozin?
6721,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,There's not a moment to waste.
6722,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,Don't breathe the toxic gas.
6723,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,It's too much.
6724,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,Please.
6725,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"Without you, all my plans are suddenly possible. I have a vision for the future, Roku."
6726,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,"Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it?"
6727,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Roku,"Make sense of our past, Aang. And you will bring peace, and restore balance in the world."
6728,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,Roku? Roku!
6729,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sozin,"With Roku gone, and the great comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world. I knew the next Avatar would be born an Air Nomad. So I wiped out the Air Temples. But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me. I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain. I know he's hiding out there somewhere. The Fire Nation's greatest threat ... the last airbender."
6730,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,That can't be it! Where's the rest of it?
6731,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,"You sent this, didn't you? I found the secret history, which by the way should be renamed history most people already know! The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end."
6732,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Iroh,No. He wasn't.
6733,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,What are you talking about?
6734,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Iroh,"You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather. Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku."
6735,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Zuko,Why are you telling me this?
6736,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Iroh,"Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself. Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side. What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by ''you''. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore ''balance'' to the world."
6737,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Iroh,This is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn by the Crown Prince.
6738,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Toph,It's like these people are born bad.
6739,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,"No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all."
6740,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sokka,Then what ''was'' the point?
6741,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,"Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. And I also think it was about friendships."
6742,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Toph,Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?
6743,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Aang,I don't see why not.
6744,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Sokka,"Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ..."
6745,1,The Avatar and the Fire Lord,Fire,3,46,Katara,"Oh, Sokka, just hold hands."
6746,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!
6747,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.
6748,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,Okay. I'm ready for some training.
6749,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Good job, Twinkle Toes. Visualize, then attack."
6750,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph!"
6751,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"What's the matter? Can't handle a little dirt, Madame Fussy-Britches?"
6752,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Oh, sorry. Did I splash you, Mud-Slug?"
6753,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,Are we taking a break?
6754,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,Sneak Attack!
6755,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud."
6756,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Hungry for a mud pie?
6757,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I'll give you a mud pie!
6758,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me."
6759,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"While Katara cleans up, let's go have some fun!"
6760,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,Yeah!
6761,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,Yes!
6762,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Look at all those messenger hawks! You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I could just send them messages."
6763,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you."
6764,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"So, guys. What are we gonna get with our last silver piece?"
6765,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,We can get more money. Right there.
6766,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my earthbending.
6767,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Dealer,You there. Wanna play a friendly game?
6768,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,How can I possibly play? I'm blind.
6769,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Dealer,You don't have to see to be lucky.
6770,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"Flamey-O, Toph."
6771,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Dealer,Wow. Fancy guessing. You are amazing at this. Would you like to make the game a little more interesting?
6772,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,More interesting? How?
6773,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Dealer,"Well, let's say you toss in your friend's fine sword there, then I'll put up twenty silver pieces against it, and that's more interesting."
6774,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I'll do it for forty silver pieces.
6775,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Dealer,Forty silver pieces it is.
6776,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Dealer,"Sorry, little lady, but- Huh?"
6777,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I won!
6778,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?
6779,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,Toph got us money. She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like.
6780,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,She used earthbending to win the game! Classic!
6781,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Ah, so she cheated."
6782,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Hey! I only cheated because he was cheating! I cheated a cheater. What's wrong with that?
6783,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I'm just saying this isn't something we should make a habit of doing.
6784,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Why? Because it's fun? And you hate fun?
6785,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I don't hate fun! See? Fun!
6786,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"Katara, I'll personally make you an Avatar Promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams."
6787,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen."
6788,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up?
6789,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Oh, I'm sorry! You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child?"
6790,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Yeah! Maybe! Maybe then you'd see how great we have it! I mean, look at us! We're traveling around the world! Making easy money! Having fun! With no parents to tell us what to do!"
6791,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,Ah. I see. You're acting like this because of your parents.
6792,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Whatever.
6793,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty."
6794,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I ''do'' hate them.
6795,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"I don't think so. I think you miss them, but you just don't wanna deal with that, so instead you act like this crazy person."
6796,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that. We've already got some third-eyed freak after us."
6797,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Speaking of that ""third-eyed freak"", I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of ""Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man""? Just think about it."
6798,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,We have enough money! You need to stop this!
6799,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I'll stop when I wanna stop and not when you tell me!
6800,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later."
6801,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting. Good little messenger hawky. Who's got pretty feathers? You're right, Hawky. This is bad."
6802,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like."
6803,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Well it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper."
6804,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you the Runaway.
6805,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"A wanted poster! That's so great! ""The Runaway."" I love my new nickname. Is there a picture of me? Does it look good?"
6806,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. But, Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us."
6807,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. Think of it this way: Now you've got plenty of money to help with the invasion plan.
6808,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa."
6809,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Here's a little extra, so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what? Make it an atlas."
6810,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,I do like expensive atlases.
6811,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Of course you do. And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret.
6812,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Not just a bird, a messenger bird. Now we can send messages all over the world. Even to Gran Gran."
6813,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"Wow, how does it work?"
6814,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Hm. Uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky, Gran Gran, South Pole. I think he gets it."
6815,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,Hawky! Make nice! Bad Hawky!
6816,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,Well. Look who decided to join us. Where have you two been? Off scamming again?
6817,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Yes, we were."
6818,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?
6819,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"No, I don't."
6820,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,Really?
6821,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Yes. Really.
6822,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,Well then. What's this?
6823,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"I don't know! I mean, seriously! What is with you people? I'm ''blind''!"
6824,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"It's a wanted poster of you! ""The Runaway!"" Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this?"
6825,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Where did you get that!?
6826,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is-
6827,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,You went through my stuff! You had no right!
6828,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it!"
6829,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"That's a lie! You're lying, Katara!"
6830,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Fine! It's a lie! But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up! I knew you were hiding something and you were! Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!"
6831,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Oh really, Mom? Or what are you gonna do? Send me to my room?"
6832,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I wish I could!
6833,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Well you can't! Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom!"
6834,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I never said I was!
6835,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"No, but you certainly act like it! You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not! You're just a regular kid like the rest of us! So stop acting like you can tell me what to do! I can do whatever I want!"
6836,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"I don't act that way! Sokka, do I act motherly?"
6837,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,Hey. I'm staying out of this one.
6838,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom?"
6839,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"Well. I, uh-"
6840,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!
6841,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"Yes, ma'am."
6842,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I can't be around you right now!
6843,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Well, I can't be around you!"
6844,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along?"
6845,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Hey, Aang. You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea."
6846,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,Sure.
6847,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again."
6848,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas."
6849,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"It's a gift. ""Dear Katara, sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph."""
6850,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"I know this is from you, Sokka! Toph can't write! Ugh! You're all driving me crazy!"
6851,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.
6852,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,Yup. We're idiots.
6853,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.
6854,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help. Come on. We need to talk."
6855,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,So lemme guess: You brought me out here to tell me that your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.
6856,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Nah, she's pretty much a pain. She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ..."
6857,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Yeah. I don't know how you could deal with it.
6858,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Actually, in a way, I rely on it."
6859,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I don't understand.
6860,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom."
6861,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I guess I never thought about that.
6862,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture."
6863,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom. Don't ever tell her I said any of this!"
6864,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Hey, my lips are sealed."
6865,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Hi, Toph. Um, I wanna-"
6866,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them."
6867,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,Actually I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say ... I wanna pull a scam with you.
6868,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,What? ''You'' wanna pull a scam?
6869,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Not just any scam. The ''ultimate'' scam. Whaddaya say, Toph? Just me and you. One last go. You in?"
6870,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,You ''know'' I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours?
6871,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!
6872,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.
6873,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Town authority,You did the right thing by turning in the Runaway.
6874,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,The right thing is its own reward.
6875,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Town authority,"Well, I'm happy to hear you say that."
6876,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"But, I still want the actual reward."
6877,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Town authority,Of course. Right this way.
6878,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Hey! What kind of cell is this?
6879,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Female guard,A wooden one.
6880,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Town authority,That's her! That's the girl you were looking for!
6881,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?
6882,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out. You two behave. Appa's in charge.
6883,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Wait! It's a trap!
6884,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Really? No kidding! Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?"
6885,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Not for us, Katara! We're the bait! He wants Aang!"
6886,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I can't believe I'm so stupid! See? This is exactly why I'm against these scams! I knew this would happen!
6887,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"But, this was ''your'' idea."
6888,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I know. I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.
6889,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with."
6890,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I know your relationship with your parents is complicated. And I shouldn't have said what I said.
6891,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"It's okay. I was really mad when you said that because ... well because, maybe it's true. I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them."
6892,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,Where do you think they might be?
6893,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,"Where do you think anyone is? Sokka, watch out! It's Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man!"
6894,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit."
6895,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,What are we gonna do?
6896,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I don't know. I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables.
6897,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,What about your meteor bracelet? You can make a saw.
6898,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I left it back at camp. I was worried they would take it.
6899,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Um, Katara? Are you okay?"
6900,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,Just fine.
6901,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Well, what are you doing?"
6902,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I'm making my own water.
6903,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Katara! You're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius!"
6904,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,This guy is too good! He shoots fire from his brain!
6905,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Aang,We should split up. He can't chase us both.
6906,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"Aang, get up!"
6907,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Let's get out of here!
6908,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Hey, I got it! The perfect name for that guy: ""Combustion Man!"""
6909,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,"Good job, Sokka. Now let's get outta here before Combustion Man catches us."
6910,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,See? It fits so well!
6911,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy? Yeah. You're such a lazy little bird."
6912,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,Katara? I need your help.
6913,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,"What is it, Toph?"
6914,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Toph,I need you to write some things down for me. I wanna send a letter to my parents.
6915,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Katara,I'll be happy to help.
6916,1,The Runaway,Fire,3,47,Sokka,"Hey, where'd Hawky go?"
6917,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Avatar Roku,Previously on Avatar ...
6918,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole. This ship has haunted my tribe when Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.
6919,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Yue,"The legend said the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestor saw how it pushed and pulled the tides, and learned how to do it themselves."
6920,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,I always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.
6921,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,What are you doing?
6922,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,I'm making my own water!
6923,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,"I think I like ""the man with a sword for a hand"" better."
6924,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.
6925,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"No, wait! I've got one! And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story."
6926,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"Is this one of those ""a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to"" stories?"
6927,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"No, it happened to Mom."
6928,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home. Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice. ""It's so cold and I can't get warm!"" Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone."
6929,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,Where'd she go?
6930,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm."
6931,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,"Wait! Guys, did you hear that? I hear people under the mountain. And they're screaming."
6932,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,Pfft! Nice try.
6933,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,"No, I'm serious. I hear something."
6934,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ...
6935,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,It just ... stopped.
6936,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,"All right, now I'm getting scared."
6937,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Hello, children."
6938,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,Sorry to frighten you. My name is Hama. You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night. I have an inn nearby. Why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds?
6939,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"Yes, please."
6940,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn.
6941,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,Aren't you sweet? You know you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in.
6942,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"What do you mean ""disappearing""?"
6943,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Don't worry, you'll all be completely safe here. Why don't I show you to your rooms and you can get a good night's rest?"
6944,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"I know, Momo. This place is creepy! I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep!"
6945,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Wakey, wakey! Time to go shopping!"
6946,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages?
6947,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly!
6948,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Villager,You won't have any ash bananas till next week?
6949,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Shop owner,"Well, I have to send the boy to Hing Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip."
6950,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Villager,"Oh, right. Tomorrow's the full moon."
6951,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Shop owner,Exactly. I can't lose ''another'' delivery boy in the woods.
6952,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons? This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans."
6953,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,"I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad."
6954,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!"
6955,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,Helping people ... that's what I do.
6956,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,Why don't you take all those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.
6957,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,This is a mysterious little town you have here.
6958,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,Mysterious town for mysterious children.
6959,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something."
6960,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.
6961,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"But what did she mean by that comment, ""mysterious children""?"
6962,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?"
6963,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,I'm gonna take a look around.
6964,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? You can't just snoop around someone's house."
6965,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,It'll be fine.
6966,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,She could be home any minute.
6967,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!"
6968,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,I'm not finished yet. Come on ...
6969,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,"Okay, that's pretty creepy."
6970,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here?"
6971,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!
6972,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"We'll see. It's empty, except for a little chest."
6973,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,Maybe it's treasure!
6974,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room!"
6975,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,I have to see what's in there.
6976,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,We shouldn't be doing this.
6977,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,Maybe there's a key here somewhere ...
6978,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,Ooh! Hand it over!
6979,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"Come on, come on!"
6980,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,"Guys, I don't know about this ..."
6981,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,This is crazy! I'm leaving!
6982,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"Suit yourself! Do it, Toph!"
6983,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,I'll tell you what's in the box.
6984,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,An old comb?
6985,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I own from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.
6986,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,You're from the Southern Water Tribe?
6987,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,Just like you.
6988,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,How did you know?
6989,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,I heard you talking around your campfire.
6990,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,But why didn't you tell us?
6991,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"I wanted to surprise you! I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough."
6992,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,Great ...
6993,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,I knew I felt a bond with you right away.
6994,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. But I'm sorry we were sneaking around."
6995,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Apology accepted. Now, let's get cooking!"
6996,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,I'd steer clear of the sea prunes.
6997,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,I thought they were ocean kumquats.
6998,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,Close enough.
6999,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,Who wants five flavor soup?
7000,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,You're a waterbender! I've never met another waterbender from our tribe!
7001,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,So how did you end up out here?
7002,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,I was stolen from my home.
7003,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,It was over sixty years ago when the raids started.
7004,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"They came again and again, each time rounding up more of our waterbenders and taking them captive."
7005,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued."
7006,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Finally, I too was captured."
7007,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,I was led away in chains. The last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe.
7008,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape.
7009,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?
7010,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.
7011,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.
7012,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Oh, you poor things."
7013,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero.
7014,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone.
7015,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me."
7016,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Growing up in the South Pole, waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas. But as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go."
7017,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"I know! When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do."
7018,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.
7019,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.
7020,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you could even pull water out of thin air?"
7021,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"You have got to keep an open mind, Katara. There's water in places you never think about."
7022,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.
7023,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,Maybe the Moon Spirit just turned mean.
7024,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!"
7025,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,"Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?"
7026,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Villager,Only one man ever saw it and lived and that's Old Man Ding.
7027,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,Where does Old Man Ding live?
7028,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"Wow, these flowers are beautiful."
7029,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"They're called fire lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants and all living things, they're filled with water."
7030,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside.
7031,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,You can take it even further.
7032,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"That was incredible! It's a shame about the lilies, though."
7033,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak."
7034,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.
7035,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Oh, Katara. Two master waterbenders beneath a full moon? I don't think we have anything to worry about."
7036,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,Old Man Ding?
7037,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Ding,"Huh? Ow, dang blame it! What? Can't you see I'm busy? Got a full moon rising. And why does everyone call me that? I'm not that old! Well, I'm young at heart."
7038,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Ding,Not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster yet at least.
7039,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,We wanted to ask you about that.
7040,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?
7041,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Ding,"Didn't see no spirit, just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain. I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs. It just about had me into a cave up there. And I looked up at the moon for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light. But then the sun started to rise and I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!"
7042,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?
7043,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,Oh no! I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there!
7044,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,I can hear them. They're this way!
7045,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,Can you feel the power the full moon brings?
7046,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"For generations it has blessed waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things!"
7047,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,This is the place.
7048,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,I can't see anything down there.
7049,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,That's why you have me. Let's go!
7050,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,I didn't know spirits made prisons like this. Who brought you here?
7051,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Female prisoner,It was no spirit.
7052,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,A witch? What do you mean?
7053,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Female prisoner,"She seems like a normal old woman, but she controls people like some dark puppetmaster!"
7054,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,Hama!
7055,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,I knew there was something creepy about her!
7056,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,We have to stop Hama!
7057,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Toph,I'll get these people out of here. You go!
7058,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"What I'm about to show you, I discovered in that wretched Fire Nation prison."
7059,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground. Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. Any sign of trouble was met with ''cruel'' retribution. And yet each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. There had to be something I could do to escape. Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape. Bloodbending. Controlling the water in another body, enforcing your own will over theirs. Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men."
7060,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,But ... to reach inside someone and control them? I don't know if I want that kind of power.
7061,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother!"
7062,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,I know.
7063,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,It's you ... You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!
7064,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters! They deserve the same! You must carry on my work!"
7065,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,I won't! I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town!
7066,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"You should've learned the technique before you turned against me! It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip! I control every muscle, every vein in your body!"
7067,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,Stop! Please ...
7068,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!"
7069,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,Aahhh!
7070,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"We know what you've been doing, Hama!"
7071,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,Give up! You're outnumbered!
7072,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,No! You've outnumbered yourselves.
7073,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Sokka,"Katara, look out! It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!"
7074,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,This feels weird!
7075,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,"I'm sorry, Aang!"
7076,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Aang,It's okay!
7077,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"Don't hurt your friends, Katara! And don't let them hurt each other!"
7078,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Katara,No!
7079,1,The Puppetmaster,Fire,3,48,Hama,"My work is done. Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender."
7080,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,This is it! The official rendezvous point for the invasion force.
7081,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,How did you pick this place?
7082,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,"Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map. It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place."
7083,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Nice choice, Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule."
7084,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Wait! Four days? The invasion's in ''four'' days?
7085,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,Whatever. That's like four days from now. Let's just calm down and-
7086,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Sokka's got the right idea, Aang. We're here. We're ready. The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest."
7087,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,I guess.
7088,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord! I'm bringing you down."
7089,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Ozai,Really? How do you plan on doing that when you're not even wearing pants?
7090,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Oh no!
7091,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"It was just a dream, Momo. I still have my pants. Well, I better keep training."
7092,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,I'm just going to Mai's house. It's not far.
7093,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,Hey. How long have you been up?
7094,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,A couple hours. I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai.
7095,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"You know, there is such a thing as over-training."
7096,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"You don't get it, do you? My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending. Not even the basics."
7097,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,"That's okay, Aang. The eclipse will block off firebending anyway. You don't need to know it. Plus, it's a stupid element."
7098,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Okay, well I still have to work on everything else. I better spend the whole day training."
7099,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Good night, Katara. Good night, Sokka. Good night, Toph. Good night, Appa. Good night, Momo. Good night, Appa and Mo-"
7100,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Ozai,"So it seems, but are you prepared for your ... mathematics test?"
7101,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test!
7102,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,I've gotta be ready.
7103,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep."
7104,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,But I forgot my pants and my math test.
7105,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Aang, sleep. Please. For me."
7106,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"Tell me, if you could have anything you want right now, what would it be?"
7107,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,"Hm ... A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top."
7108,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"You know, being a prince and all, I ''might'' just be able to make that happen."
7109,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,That would be impressive.
7110,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"Do you think you could find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top?"
7111,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Servant,"Excellent choice, sir."
7112,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,"I guess there's some nice perks that come with being royalty. Though there's annoying stuff, too. Like that all-day war meeting coming up."
7113,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,War meeting? What are you talking about?
7114,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,"Azula mentioned something. I-I assumed you were going, too."
7115,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,I guess I wasn't invited.
7116,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Ozai,"Wake up, Aang. Wake up, sleepy head! Rise and shine! You overslept. You missed the invasion."
7117,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Sokka, get up! I needa know what day it is!"
7118,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,What? Who's talking?
7119,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,Relax! It's still two days before the invasion!
7120,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises."
7121,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,What?
7122,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you were too slow and they got you!"
7123,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,But that was just a dream. I'm a great climber!
7124,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Then climb that cliff! Climb it fast!
7125,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,Stupid Avatar! Stupid cliff! Stupid dream! I can climb fast!
7126,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Don't drink that!
7127,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,Why? Is it poisoned?
7128,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom! We died because of your tiny bladder. And you need to start wearing your hair up. In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-."
7129,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Aang! I know you're just trying to help, but you ''really'' need to get a grip. You're unraveling."
7130,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,You're right. I'm losing my mind.
7131,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves."
7132,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,"Of course you are. That's 'cause you gotta fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet. And you better win or we're all done for."
7133,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,Sokka! You're not helping!
7134,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,What? It's true. That's the deal. He knows it.
7135,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"You know what, I've got just the thing! Get ready to be de-stressified!"
7136,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach ''up''. Reach for the sun. Feel your chi paths clearing. Now close your eyes. How are you feeling?
7137,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,I feel ... really warm.
7138,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Good, good. Go on."
7139,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Like there's this warm feeling all around me. This heat. Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me! And the whole world is being engulfed in flames!
7140,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,Maybe your stress is the kind you need to ''talk'' out.
7141,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.
7142,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,You ''know'' what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.
7143,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,"Tell me more about this ""Fire Lord"". Why are you so afraid of him?"
7144,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,You said it yourself! He's the baddest man on the planet! I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world!
7145,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,"Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil."
7146,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Okay! But what can I do to feel better?
7147,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,Want to try screaming into this pillow?
7148,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Azula,"Hello, Zuzu. If you've come for a royal hair-combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait."
7149,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh? And apparently I'm not welcome there."
7150,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Azula,What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there!
7151,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"Oh, yeah?! I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it!"
7152,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Azula,"Oh, Zuko. Don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably just weren't invited because it's so ''obvious'' you're supposed to be there."
7153,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"Well, were you invited?"
7154,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Azula,Of course! I'm the princess.
7155,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,And I'm the prince!
7156,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Azula,"Exactly, so stop acting like a paranoid child! Just go to the meeting."
7157,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,Forget it! I'm not going!
7158,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,All right! What you need is a good old-fashioned back pounding to relieve your stress.
7159,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Pound away.
7160,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Ow! Toph ... I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me!
7161,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,"Sorry. I forgot you had baby skin. Well, there's one other thing we can try. Acupuncture!"
7162,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,"Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting. Who cares?"
7163,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,I don't.
7164,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,"Well, good. You shouldn't. I mean, why would you even ''want'' to go? Just think about how things went the last meeting you went to."
7165,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,I know.
7166,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,You know what will make you feel better? Ordering some servants around. I might be hungry for a whole ''tray'' of fruit tarts. And maybe a little palanquin ride around town. Double time.
7167,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Thanks for everything, guys."
7168,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"So, do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night's sleep?"
7169,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better. Maybe."
7170,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,Then our work here is done.
7171,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"What happened, Aang?"
7172,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.
7173,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,Looks like it's time for another ... therapy session.
7174,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!
7175,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Invasion. All aboard for the invasion.
7176,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,You don't look so good. You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?
7177,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"I told you, I can't go back to sleep."
7178,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you."
7179,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara."
7180,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,What big things?
7181,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this. I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. I'm doing it for you, Katara."
7182,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Aang, what are you saying?"
7183,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"I'm saying, I love you!"
7184,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,What are we doing?
7185,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby, you're my forever girl."
7186,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,Aang! I was just saying you should take a nap.
7187,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream."
7188,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,What was your dream about?
7189,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Uh, living underwater?"
7190,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,Sounds neat!
7191,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Servant,"Prince Zuko, everyone's waiting for you."
7192,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,What?
7193,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Servant,"The high admirals, the high generals, the war ministers, and the princess have all arrived. You're the only person missing."
7194,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"So, my dad ''wants'' me at the meeting?"
7195,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Servant,"The Fire Lord said he would not start until you arrived, sir."
7196,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Put 'em up, Fire Lord!"
7197,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,Hey! I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's ''your'' bison.
7198,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach.
7199,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord?"
7200,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Momo,"Boy, you are really starting to lose it, kid."
7201,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Momo, did you hear something?"
7202,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Momo,"No, but I said something. You, my friend, are just a few plums short of a fruit pie."
7203,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"That's more like it. I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me. Oh, Momo, let me explain."
7204,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,Aang? We're all starting to get a little worried about you.
7205,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,You've been awake too long.
7206,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,And you're acting downright weird.
7207,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Appa,You've got to take care of yourself. You can't go on like this.
7208,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares. They were just too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it."
7209,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Momo,Yeah! Leave the kid alone!
7210,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Appa,"Hey, who asked ''you''?"
7211,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"You guys, come on."
7212,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Appa,No! I am sick of this guy always mouthing me and telling me what to do!
7213,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Momo,"Oh, you don't like it? Well, let's go right now!"
7214,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Sokka, what do we do?"
7215,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,About what?
7216,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,About that!
7217,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Koala sheep,Appa! Appa! Appa! Momo! Momo! Momo!
7218,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Come on, guys. We're all on the same side."
7219,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Pathik,"Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras. Chakras, chakras, chakras sandwich tastes good. Yum!"
7220,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Koala sheep,Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!
7221,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,I just need to jump in a cold waterfall!
7222,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,"So, how did it go?"
7223,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me. My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him. I was ''literally'' at his right hand."
7224,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Mai,"Zuko, that's wonderful! You must be happy."
7225,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Zuko,"During the meeting, I was the perfect prince. The son my father wanted. But I wasn't me."
7226,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds."
7227,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,Hey! It's real! We spent ''hours'' working on it.
7228,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope.
7229,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow!"
7230,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,Aang ...
7231,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"No, Katara! There's still ''so'' much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I ''need'' is practice. Quick, hit me!"
7232,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,I'm ''not'' going to hit you.
7233,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,You want me to do it?
7234,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Katara,"Listen to me. You've been training for this since the day we met. I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough."
7235,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,You really think so?
7236,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Sokka,We all do. You can do this. You're ready.
7237,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Toph,"You're the man, Twinkle Toes!"
7238,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"Thanks, guys. You know what? I think I am ready. Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!"
7239,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Ozai,Really? You're gonna take me out? You're not even wearing pants!
7240,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Aang,"No, Fire Lord Ozai. ''You're'' not wearing any pants."
7241,1,Nightmares and Daydreams,Fire,3,49,Ozai,No! My royal parts are showing.
7242,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,Sounds like you slept well.
7243,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Toph,"So, what's your strategy for taking him down? Gonna get your glow on and hit him with a little Avatar State action?"
7244,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,"I can't. When Azula shot me with lightning, my seventh chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe."
7245,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Toph,"You know what I just heard? Blah, blah, spiritual mumbo jumbo blah, blah, something about space."
7246,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,No. That ''is'' the invasion!
7247,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"You made it, Dad!"
7248,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find?
7249,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"I did. But I'm a little worried, Sokka. Some of these men aren't exactly the ""warrior type""."
7250,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Due,"Oooh-whee! This place ain't nothing like a swamp. What you reckon that is, Tho? Some sort of Fire Nation exploding trap what eat ya?"
7251,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Tho,"It's just a rock, Due."
7252,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Due,"Well, I'll be."
7253,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Is it just me, or are those fellas a little loose in the leaf-hat?"
7254,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Bato,I just wish they would wear pants.
7255,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Huu,"Pants are an illusion, and so is death."
7256,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,Haru! It's so good to see you!
7257,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,"Toph, this is Haru. When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation. So he had to hide his earthbending."
7258,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Haru,Katara inspired me and my father to take back our village.
7259,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Tyro,"You helped us find our courage, Katara. Now we're here to help you."
7260,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Toph,No way! Is that-
7261,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Big Bad Hippo,Hippo happy to see Blind Bandit!
7262,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Toph,You guys here for a rematch?
7263,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,The Boulder,"Negatory. The Boulder and The Hippo no longer fight for others' entertainment. Now, we fight for our kingdom!"
7264,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Toph,Sweet.
7265,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,Was that a new invention?
7266,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Mechanist,"Yes, but unfortunately the incendiary capabilities of peanut sauce prove to be a failure."
7267,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,You're making peanut sauce bombs?
7268,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Pipsqueak,They're destructive.
7269,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,The Duke,And delicious.
7270,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,Where you able to complete work on the plans I send you?
7271,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Mechanist,"Yes, I was, and I think the Fire Nation will be quite surprised."
7272,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Teo,"Aang, my dad and I made this for you."
7273,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,A new glider! This is amazing!
7274,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Mechanist,"And as a special feature, I added the snack compartment."
7275,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,"Oh ... well, I'm sure that will come in handy."
7276,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Warden Poon,I bet you're tired of being in this cell old man. Well too bad. You're never stepping outside these walls again.
7277,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Ming,Breakfast.
7278,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Warden Poon,"Careful, Ming, don't get too close. His stench will knock you right out."
7279,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Ming,I snuck in some white jade tea. I know you like rare teas.
7280,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Iroh,"Thank you, Ming. Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me."
7281,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Don't worry, you'll do great."
7282,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"Good morning everyone. Ahh! Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation! I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here? Uh anyway, the Fire Lord's palace is here . Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here, and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us! And ... um ... I'm sorry let me start at the beginning . Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki, who's a Kyoshi warrior. She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ..."
7283,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"Wow, when he says the beginning he means the ''beginning'' beginning."
7284,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ...
7285,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Thank you, Sokka. It's okay why don't you take a break? Let me just clarify a few points for everyone. Today, is the day of black sun, and I want to thank you all for your self-sacrifice, and your courage. There are two steps to the invasion, a naval stage, and then a land stage. To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here, The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard. We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower. Once we do that, it's up to the Royal Palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin."
7286,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,The Boulder,"Excuse me. The Boulder is confused. Isn't the point to invade ''during'' the eclipse, when the firebenders are powerless?"
7287,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"The eclipse only lasts eight minutes, not enough time for the whole invasion. And the Royal Palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse's advantage the ''most''. When this is finished, the Avatar will have defeated the Fire Lord. We will have control of the Fire Nation capital, and this war will be over!"
7288,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave.
7289,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"I messed up, Aang."
7290,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,What?
7291,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it. I just fell apart.
7292,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,"Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that."
7293,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"My dad is! He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should."
7294,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?"
7295,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.
7296,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"There they are, the Great Gates of Azulon."
7297,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,I don't see any gates.
7298,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Katara, you and the swamp benders whip up a fog cover."
7299,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Tho,We'll sneak by them statues just like we sneak by that Fire Navy blockade!
7300,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Keep it up, we're almost through!"
7301,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Male Fire Nation soldier,"No one's on board, sir."
7302,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Female Fire Nation soldier,Where'd they go?
7303,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"You've really outdone yourself this time, son."
7304,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Toph,"Yeah, congratulations, Sokka. You managed to invent a worse way of travel than flying."
7305,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,The Duke,Helmet?
7306,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"Well, I just came up with the idea. The mechanist did all the work."
7307,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Mechanist,"Now don't sell yourself short, my boy. It was your idea to use waterbending to make the subs sink and float, brilliant! Though your original designs were a bit difficult to decipher. Unfortunately there is one problem I couldn't fix. The subs have a limited air supply. Before we land on the beaches, we'll need to resurface."
7308,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Ming,"Lunchtime, General Iroh. And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice."
7309,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Iroh,"Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable. I think you should take the rest of the day off."
7310,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Ming,What?
7311,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Iroh,You don't look well. Maybe you should go home and rest.
7312,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Ming,"No, I feel fine."
7313,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Iroh,Trust me. It is better that you are not here this afternoon.
7314,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,"So, this is it huh?"
7315,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive?
7316,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,I'm ready.
7317,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Toph,"I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, Twinkle Toes."
7318,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Everyone listen up. The next time we resurface, it'll be on the beaches. So stay alert, and fight smart. Now break time's over, back in the subs."
7319,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,"Katara, I ..."
7320,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"Aang, I ..."
7321,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,You go first.
7322,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you."
7323,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,"Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it."
7324,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"Yes, it is."
7325,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,What if ... what if I don't come back?
7326,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"Aang, don't say that, of course you'll-"
7327,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge."
7328,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"What? Right, I'm on it."
7329,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Zuko,I'm sorry Mai.
7330,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,What do you know? It ''did'' come in handy.
7331,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Everyone in position. Earthbenders, into your tanks. This is gonna be a rough ride."
7332,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,Ready the torpedo. Launch!
7333,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Tho,We're a man down. Where in tarnation is Huu?
7334,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Due,Hey Huu! Where you been?
7335,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Huu,Communin' with nature. Takes a while to collect this much seaweed.
7336,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"Dad, look out!"
7337,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Sokka, we've gotta take out those battlements! It's our only chance."
7338,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,I've got an idea.
7339,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,You two take out that battlement. I got this one. Watch each other's backs.
7340,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,Dad?
7341,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,Dad!
7342,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Zuko,"I know I've made some bad choices, but today, I'm gonna set things right."
7343,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"How does that feel, dad?"
7344,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Ah, a little, better. I need, to get back to the troops. Ahh!"
7345,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"You're hurt, badly. You can't fight anymore."
7346,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,"Everyone's counting on me to lead this mission Katara, I won't let them down. Ahh!"
7347,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,Can't you heal him any faster?
7348,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,I'm doing everything I can.
7349,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,I'll do it.
7350,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands."
7351,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,No. I'll lead the invasion force.
7352,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,Don't be crazy Sokka.
7353,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does."
7354,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Hakoda,You can do this. I'm proud of you son.
7355,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Katara,"I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too."
7356,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,Yip yip.
7357,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Sokka,"Listen up, everyone. I want the tanks in wedge formation. Warriors and benders in the middle. We're taking that tower, and heading for the royal palace. Charge!"
7358,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Aang,That's strange. The Avatar is back! Hello? Anyone home?
7359,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Tyro,The Fire Nation is falling back!
7360,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",Fire,3,50,Bato,"Sokka, we're on our way to victory!"
7361,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Dad! You're on your feet again.
7362,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.
7363,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,"Let's hope our luck holds out. Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?"
7364,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,Yeah. Is that ... is that ''Aang''?
7365,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,What? Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down.
7366,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.
7367,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,"If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, I'm just the girl to find it."
7368,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,The mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse. Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord.
7369,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,We can still do this. We can still win the day.
7370,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,"Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it."
7371,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,"What do you think? You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you."
7372,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,I've gotta try.
7373,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,Do you feel anything down there?
7374,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano.
7375,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?
7376,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,"There is something big, dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano."
7377,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Sounds like a secret bunker to me.
7378,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,Stay safe. We'll be back soon.
7379,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,This way! That one's a dead end!
7380,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,What would we do without you?
7381,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,Perish in burning hot magma.
7382,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,The tunnel continues on the other side and It leads right to the bunker.
7383,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,"We'll have to be fast, but careful."
7384,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,How is that careful?
7385,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,"I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky."
7386,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,There's no floor. It's just a river of lava.
7387,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,Climb aboard and hold on tight.
7388,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,That's some door!
7389,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,Not a problem.
7390,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,I am so glad we added you to the group!
7391,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Fire Nation Captain,Retreat! Everyone move to the secondary defensive position! Retreat!
7392,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Bato,The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up to hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time it's finished.
7393,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,We can wait here if you want.
7394,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,No. I wanna press forward with the others.
7395,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Qin,"The Fire Lord's chamber is that way, down the hall, to the left, and up the stairs, you can't miss it!"
7396,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,Thanks!
7397,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Only thirty seconds until the total eclipse.
7398,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.
7399,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,"So, you are alive after all. I had a hunch that you survived. But it doesn't matter. I've known about the invasion for months."
7400,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,I'm ready to face you.
7401,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,Prince Zuko? What are you doing here?
7402,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Mechanist,The eclipse is starting! Put on your eclipse glasses!
7403,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,Why are you here?
7404,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,I'm here to tell the truth.
7405,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse. This should be interesting.
7406,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,"First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me."
7407,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,Why would she lie to me about that?
7408,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,Because the Avatar's not dead. He survived.
7409,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,What?
7410,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,"In fact, he's probably leading this invasion. He could be on his way here right now."
7411,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you!
7412,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore.
7413,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,"You will obey me, or this defiant breath will be your last!"
7414,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,"Think again. I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen."
7415,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,Where is he? Where's the Fire Lord?
7416,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,You mean I'm not good enough for you? You're hurting my feelings.
7417,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,"Stop wasting our time and give us the information. You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse."
7418,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying.
7419,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar. I am a four-hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.
7420,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,When I left Ba Sing Se I brought home some souvenirs: Dai Li agents!
7421,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Bato,"Surround the periphery! We have to secure the palace by the time the eclipse is over! Otherwise, we'll be in for the fight of our lives."
7422,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Tyro,Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you.
7423,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Fire Nation soldier,"We'll never surrender! Okay, we surrender."
7424,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,There it is: the Fire Nation Royal Palace. We've come so far.
7425,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,It's not over yet.
7426,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,"For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn. My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai. How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?"
7427,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,It was to teach you respect!
7428,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,It was cruel! And it was wrong.
7429,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,Then you have learned nothing!
7430,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,"No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it! We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself , we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness."
7431,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,"Your uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he?"
7432,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,Yes. He has.
7433,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,I can't pin her down! She's too quick!
7434,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Wait! Aang! Toph! Stop attacking! Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!
7435,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,Not true. I'm giving it my all.
7436,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!
7437,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,"Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes."
7438,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,I'll roll your whole head!
7439,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,She's just baiting you again.
7440,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,"Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?"
7441,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.
7442,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you.
7443,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Ignore!
7444,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,"So, Sokka's your name, right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time. She was convinced you were going to come rescue her. Of course you never came, and she gave up on you."
7445,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,Come and get it.
7446,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Where. Is. Suki?!
7447,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,"After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness. He's the one who's been a real father to me."
7448,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,"Oh, that's just beautiful. And maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure."
7449,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,But I've come to an even more important decision. I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you.
7450,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,"Really? Since you're a full-blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless. You've got your swords. Why don't you just do it now?"
7451,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny. Goodbye.
7452,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,"Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me, but you'll only do it during the eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your mother?"
7453,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,What happened that night?
7454,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,"My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son, and I was going to do it. Your mother found out and swore she would protect you at any cost. She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan, a plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared."
7455,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Where's Suki? Answer me!
7456,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,"Sokka, she won't talk."
7457,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Where are you keeping her?
7458,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,"Your mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was banished."
7459,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Zuko,So she's alive?
7460,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Ozai,Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason. Your penalty will be far steeper.
7461,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,"Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on."
7462,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now.
7463,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,I fell for it! I used up all our time.
7464,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,"It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out."
7465,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,And now it's too late.
7466,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over. But I can face the Fire Lord anyway.
7467,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,No. I don't think that's a good idea.
7468,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.
7469,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Toph,The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go and help our friends.
7470,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,I guess you guys are right.
7471,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,You'll have another chance. I know you will.
7472,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Bato,"What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now?"
7473,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,"I don't know. But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute."
7474,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Mechanist,"My own invention. Oh, this is terrible!"
7475,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,They're back!
7476,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,"It was all a trap! Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move! We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely."
7477,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,"They've got air power, but so do I! I'm gonna do what I can to slow them down."
7478,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,"Appa, you and I can help too."
7479,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,"Everyone, let's get back to the subs!"
7480,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,We can't keep them all back! There's too many of them!
7481,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,Let's join the others!
7482,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Warden Poon,"He's gone. He busted himself out. I've never seen anything like it, he was like a one-man army!"
7483,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs!
7484,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?
7485,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,They're heading for the beach ... They're gonna destroy the submarines!
7486,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,How are we all going to escape?
7487,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,We're not.
7488,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,"Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win."
7489,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,"Yes, with the Avatar we could still win. On another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together."
7490,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,What? We can't leave you behind! We won't leave anyone behind!
7491,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,You're our only chance in the long run. You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe. It's the only way to keep hope alive.
7492,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Bato,"The youngest of our group should go with you. The adults will stay behind and surrender. We'll be prisoners, but we'll all survive this battle."
7493,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Tyro,"I've got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy, but we'll get by."
7494,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,They're at the beach already!
7495,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Mechanist,"Bye, son."
7496,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Teo,"Bye, Dad. I'm really proud of you."
7497,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,The Duke,"I'll miss you, Pipsqueak."
7498,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Pipsqueak,"Take care, The Duke."
7499,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Haru,"We'll be back for you, Dad."
7500,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Tyro,If we don't escape on our own first.
7501,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Hakoda,"We lost today, but we've never been this close. We tasted victory, and that counts for something."
7502,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Katara,"We'll miss you, Dad."
7503,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Sokka,"Bye, Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise."
7504,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm gonna make this up to you.
7505,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Fire Nation soldier,"Should we follow them, princess?"
7506,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Azula,"No, they're too fast. It doesn't matter. They'll be back."
7507,1,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",Fire,3,51,Aang,I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple!
7508,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,This is humiliating.
7509,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?
7510,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Both.
7511,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people."
7512,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Teo,I wonder how the rest of the troops are.
7513,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Haru,They're probably on their way to a prison. Seems like my dad just got out and now he's going back in.
7514,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,The Duke,I miss Pipsqueak.
7515,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,I miss not having blisters on my feet.
7516,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Hey, we're here! I can feel it!"
7517,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Uhhh ... I think your feet need their eyes checked.
7518,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"No, she's right. We ''are'' here!"
7519,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,Wow ... it's amazing!
7520,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Iroh,What a stunning view.
7521,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,The only view I'm interested in seeing is the Avatar in chains.
7522,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Iroh,"You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years. The chances of finding him here are ''very'' slim."
7523,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"First we'll check each of the air temples, then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him."
7524,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Iroh,"Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. You should take some time to heal and rest."
7525,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"What else would I expect to hear from the ''laziest'' man in the Fire Nation? The only way to regain my honor is to find the Avatar, so I will."
7526,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Teo,It's so different from the Northern Air Temple. I wonder if there are any secret rooms.
7527,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Haru,Let's go check it out!
7528,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,You guys go. I think we need to talk about some things.
7529,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Teo,"I'll race you, Duke."
7530,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,The Duke,"I told you, it's ''The'' Duke!"
7531,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,Why can't I go?
7532,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this."
7533,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?"
7534,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes."
7535,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"Oh, yeah. That's great, no problem. I'll just do that."
7536,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"Aang, no one said it's going to be easy."
7537,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"Well, it's not even gonna be possible! Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?"
7538,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,We could look for Jeong Jeong!
7539,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,Yeah ... right. Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.
7540,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Who's ... oh, never mind. If it's important I'll find out."
7541,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we just take a nice tour around the temple?"
7542,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,What's up with him?
7543,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending.
7544,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"Hello ... Zuko here, but I guess you probably already know me, sort of. Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm considered to be pretty good at it. Well, you've seen me, you know, when I was attacking you. Uhhh ... yeah, I guess I should apologize for that. But anyway, I'm good now. I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad, but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught the Avatar firebending. Well, what's your answer? Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself. Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do? Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends. Your choice. I guess I'm just not that good at impersonations."
7545,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?"
7546,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,What? The wind is too loud in my ears! Check out this loop!
7547,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future!"
7548,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table! Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber!"
7549,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,I think that'll have to wait.
7550,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,Hello ... Zuko here.
7551,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so, I just thought I'd wait for you here. I know you must be surprised to see me here."
7552,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Not really, since you've followed us all over the world."
7553,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"Right. Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I can teach firebending to you. See, I, uhhh ..."
7554,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,You want to ''what'' now?
7555,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?!"
7556,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang!"
7557,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"I've done some good things! I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free. That's something!"
7558,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,Appa does seem to like him.
7559,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not buying it.
7560,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes in the past."
7561,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,Like when you attacked our village?
7562,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us?
7563,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"Look, I admit I've some awful things. I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. And I never should have sent that Fire Nation assassin after you. I'm going to try and stop-"
7564,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"Well, that's not his name, but-"
7565,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Ohhh, sorry. I didn't mean to insult your friend!"
7566,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,He's not my friend!
7567,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,That guy locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us all up!
7568,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,Why aren't you saying anything? You once said you thought we could be friends. You know I have good in me.
7569,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. We'll never let you join us.
7570,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,You need to get out of here. Now.
7571,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore!
7572,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Either you leave, or we attack."
7573,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner."
7574,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"No, we won't! Get out of here, and don't come back! And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again!"
7575,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"Uggh! I can't believe how stupid I am! I mean, what was I thinking? Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would have believed that! Stupid! Uggh!"
7576,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Why would he try to fool us like that?
7577,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.
7578,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.
7579,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes."
7580,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price. We can't trust him."
7581,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?
7582,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!
7583,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!"
7584,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,I could feel it! It's my throatal flap!
7585,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He risked his life to save me."
7586,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!
7587,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him."
7588,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,You're probably right.
7589,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar!
7590,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Actually, he wasn't lying."
7591,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list."
7592,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"I'm just saying that, considering his messed-up family and how he was raised, he could have turned out a lot worse."
7593,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"You're right, Toph! Let's go find him and give him a medal. The ""not as much of a jerk as you could have been"" award!"
7594,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly."
7595,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Easy for you to say! You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates!
7596,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island!
7597,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple!
7598,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Why would you even try to defend him?
7599,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Because Katara, you're all ignoring one crucial fact: Aang needs a firebending teacher! We can't think of a single person in the world to do the job! Now one shows up on a silver platter, and you won't even think about it?"
7600,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,I'm'' not ''having Zuko as my teacher!
7601,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"You're darn right you're not, buddy."
7602,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"Well, I guess that settles that."
7603,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,Ergh! I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one around here!
7604,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,Who's there? Stay back!
7605,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,It's me! Ow! You burned my feet!
7606,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"I'm sorry, it was a mistake!"
7607,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,Get away from me!
7608,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,Let me help you! I'm sorry!
7609,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Get off me, get off me!"
7610,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"I didn't know it was you! Uggh, come back! Uggh! Why am I so bad at being good?"
7611,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Has anyone seen Toph?
7612,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.
7613,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Haru,Maybe she's just exploring the air temple. There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending.
7614,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,I think we should go look for her.
7615,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,Let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.
7616,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,The Duke,We can go check for her!
7617,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Teo,Yeah! I want to ride that tunnel down to the Hall of Statues again. It will work a lot better now that I fixed my brakes.
7618,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Toph! What happened?
7619,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,My feet got burned!
7620,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"Oh no, what happened?"
7621,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"I just told you, my feet got burned!"
7622,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"I meant, how."
7623,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night."
7624,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,You what?
7625,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,Zuko?
7626,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,Uhhh ...!
7627,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"I thought he could be helpful to us. And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out."
7628,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,So he attacked you?
7629,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Well, he did, and he didn't. It was sort of an accident."
7630,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,But he did firebend at you?
7631,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,Yes.
7632,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"See? You trusted Zuko, and you got burned. Literally!"
7633,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. I wish I could have worked on them sooner.
7634,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Yeah, me too."
7635,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him.
7636,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice."
7637,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him."
7638,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,Maybe just invite him back here. He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once.
7639,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and ''really'' make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it!"
7640,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,"You are a master of surprise, Sokka ..."
7641,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,"Ahhh, that's the stuff. Now I know how the rest of you guys feel. Not being able to see with your feet stinks."
7642,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,Stop! I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore! The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop.
7643,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"If you keep attacking, I won't pay you! All right, I'll pay you double to stop!"
7644,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side!
7645,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Katara,I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.
7646,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"I know how to get an angle on him! All right buddy, don't fail me now!"
7647,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Yeah, boomerang! Awww, boomerang ..."
7648,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko."
7649,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing."
7650,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. I'm sorry for what I did to you. It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally."
7651,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"I think you ''are'' supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me."
7652,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.
7653,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,"Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them. Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?"
7654,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Toph,Go ahead and let him join. It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.
7655,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,Sokka?
7656,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Sokka,"Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it."
7657,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Aang,Katara?
7658,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,I won't let you down! I promise!
7659,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Zuko,"If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar. I know it's my destiny to capture him."
7660,1,The Western Air Temple,Fire,3,52,Iroh,"You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday."
7661,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is ''not'' something to fear."
7662,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Okay. Not something to fear.
7663,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"But if you don't respect it, it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!"
7664,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make.
7665,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration?
7666,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Good idea. You might wanna take a couple steps back.
7667,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,What was that? That was the worst firebending I've ever seen!
7668,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,I thought it was ... nice.
7669,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Why is this happening?
7670,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Maybe it's the altitude.
7671,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Yeah, could be."
7672,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Just breathe, and ..."
7673,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,That one kind of felt hot.
7674,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Don't patronize me! You know what it's supposed to look like!
7675,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Sorry, Sifu Hotman."
7676,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,And stop calling me that!
7677,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sokka,"Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?"
7678,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Get out of here!
7679,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sokka,"Okay, take it easy. I was just kiddin' around. Jerkbending, still got it."
7680,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Listen everybody, I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff."
7681,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Toph,"Don't look at me, I didn't touch your stuff."
7682,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone.
7683,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Katara,"I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago."
7684,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Well, it's not lost. It's just ... weaker for some reason."
7685,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Katara,Maybe you're not as good as you think you are.
7686,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Toph,Ouch.
7687,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,I bet it's because I changed sides.
7688,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Katara,That's ridiculous.
7689,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.
7690,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sokka,"Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough."
7691,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Okay, cut it out! Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way."
7692,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Toph,You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source. I recommend the original source.
7693,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Toph,No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is.
7694,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Toph,"I don't know. For earthbending, the original benders were badgermoles."
7695,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Toph,"One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave."
7696,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Toph,That's where I met them.
7697,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Toph,"They were blind, just like me. So we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending, not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses. For them, the original earthbenders, it wasn't just about fighting. It was their way of interacting with the world."
7698,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"That's amazing, Toph!"
7699,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison. Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy."
7700,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct."
7701,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Well, they aren't around anymore, okay?"
7702,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Okay, okay. I'm sorry."
7703,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,But maybe there's another way. The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors.
7704,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid."
7705,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"No, they died off thousands of years ago. But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now. Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins."
7706,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present."
7707,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sokka,"So, what? Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing where they stood a thousand years ago?"
7708,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher."
7709,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster."
7710,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude."
7711,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,I can't believe this.
7712,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it."
7713,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang and Zuko,Whoa!
7714,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Even though these buildings are ancient, there's something eerily familiar about them. I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these."
7715,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Okay. We've learned something about architecture. Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher."
7716,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me."
7717,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,I can't believe it. This booby trap must be centuries old and it still works.
7718,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.
7719,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Where's that up-beat attitude you were talkin' about? Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting."
7720,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Look, this seems promising. Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending."
7721,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,They look pretty angry to me.
7722,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors.
7723,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Well, they had a funny way of showing it."
7724,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years. Something you're not telling me."
7725,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,My great-grandfather Sozin happened.
7726,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory. There were the ultimate firebenders. And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents would become legendary and you'd earn the honorary title, Dragon. The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born, by my uncle."
7727,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good?"
7728,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"He had a complicated past. Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on."
7729,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,It's locked up!
7730,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Wait. It's a celestial calendar. Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. I bet that sunstone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle. On the solstice."
7731,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.
7732,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"No, we can't. But we might be able to speed time up. Let's see if we can outsmart the sunstone."
7733,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Nothing's happening.
7734,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Come on ...
7735,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you. You're pretty smart."
7736,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Relax. They're just statues.
7737,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,It says this is something called the Dancing Dragon.
7738,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Zuko, get over here! I want you to dance with me!"
7739,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,What?
7740,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Just do it.
7741,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Let's follow the steps of the statues. Don't you see? These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson. I think this is some kind of Sun Warrior firebending form.
7742,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,This better teach us some really good firebending.
7743,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Hurray! Wait, what exactly is that?"
7744,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,It's some kind of mystical gemstone.
7745,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Well, don't touch it!"
7746,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Why not?
7747,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Remember what happened out there with those spikes? I'm just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals.
7748,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,It feels almost alive.
7749,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Oh no, it's another trap!"
7750,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Ugh, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue."
7751,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"I can't move! Zuko, do something!"
7752,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Me? I can't move either!
7753,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,It stopped.
7754,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"At least we have air. Maybe if we stay calm, we can figure a way out of this."
7755,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"You ''had'' to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?"
7756,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"At least I made something happen. If it were up to you, we'd never have made it past the courtyard."
7757,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Help!
7758,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Who are you yelling to? Nobody's lived here for centuries.
7759,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Well, what do you think we should do?"
7760,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,Who is down there?
7761,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"For trying to take our sunstone, you must be severely punished!"
7762,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,We didn't come here to take your sunstone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.
7763,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Ham Ghao,"Yeah, right. They are obviously thieves, here to steal Sun Warrior treasures."
7764,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Please, I don't normally play this card, but ... I'm the Avatar. Just hear us out."
7765,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. O-or at least I used to be. I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage. But now I want to learn the true way, the original way. When we came here, I never imagined the Sun Warrior's civilization was secretly alive. I am truly humbled to be in your presence. Please, teach us."
7766,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"If you wish to learn the ways of the Sun, you must learn them from the masters, Ran and Shaw."
7767,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Ran and Shaw? There are two of them?
7768,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"When you present yourself to them, they will examine you. They'll read your hearts, your souls, and your ancestry. If they deem you worthy, they'll teach you. If they don't, you'll be destroyed on the spot."
7769,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"If you're going to see the masters, you must bring them a piece of the Eternal Flame. This fire is the very first one. It was given to man by the dragons. We have kept it going for thousands of years."
7770,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,I don't believe it.
7771,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"You will each take a piece of it to the masters, to show your commitment to the sacred art of firebending."
7772,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"No. This ritual illustrates the essence of Sun Warrior philosophy. You must maintain a constant heat. The flame will go out if you make it too small. Make it too big, and you might lose control."
7773,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous. It's like a little heartbeat."
7774,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"Fire is life, not just destruction. You will take your flames up there. The cave of the masters is beneath that rock."
7775,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Hurry up.
7776,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"I can't. If I walk too fast, my flame will go out."
7777,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small. You're too timid, give it more juice."
7778,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,But what if I can't control it?
7779,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,You can do it. I know you can. You're a talented kid.
7780,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,Facing the judgment of the firebending masters will be very dangerous for you. Your ancestors are directly responsible for the dragons' disappearance. The masters might not be so happy to see you.
7781,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Ham Ghao,I know ''I'' wouldn't be.
7782,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,But once they find out I'm the Avatar ...
7783,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we'd hoped.
7784,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet these masters and find out what's so great about them."
7785,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"What if they judge us, and attack us?"
7786,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar. I think we could take these guys in a fight, whoever they are."
7787,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Bring 'em out!
7788,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,Chanters!
7789,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior,"Those who wish to meet the masters, Ran and Shaw, will now present their fire."
7790,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,Sound the call!
7791,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Give me some of yours.
7792,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"No, just make your own."
7793,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,I can't.
7794,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Quit being stingy!
7795,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Uh oh.
7796,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,These are the masters.
7797,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Still think we can take 'em?
7798,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Sshh. I never said that.
7799,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Ham Ghao,"Oh, here it comes. Any moment now. Dinner for the masters."
7800,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"Quiet, Ham Ghao!"
7801,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Ham Ghao,What? Everyone's thinking it.
7802,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Zuko, I think we're supposed to do the Dragon Dance with them."
7803,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it."
7804,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,Fine.
7805,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,Judgment time.
7806,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Wow.
7807,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,I understand.
7808,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined."
7809,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,Like firebending harmony.
7810,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"Yes. They judged you, and gave you visions of the meaning of firebending."
7811,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,I can't believe there are still living dragons. My uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it.
7812,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,So your uncle lied.
7813,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"Actually, it wasn't a total lie. Iroh was the last outsider to face the masters. They deemed him worthy and passed the secret onto him as well."
7814,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them."
7815,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life."
7816,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"Yeah. It's like the Sun, but inside of you. Do you guys realize this?"
7817,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"Well, our civilization is called the Sun Warriors ... so yeah."
7818,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,"That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many years, hunting you was my drive ... it was my purpose. So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive. I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world."
7819,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sun Warrior chief,"Now that you have learned the secrets, and you know about our tribe's existence, we have no choice but to imprison you here forever. Just kidding. But seriously, don't tell anyone!"
7820,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Aang,"With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable."
7821,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sokka,"Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there."
7822,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,It's not a dance. It's a firebending form.
7823,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Sokka,We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord.
7824,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!
7825,1,The Firebending Masters,Fire,3,53,Zuko,The Dancing Dragon.
7826,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"No one can make tea like Uncle , but hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?"
7827,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Katara,Sure.
7828,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Aang,I like jokes.
7829,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Toph,Bring it!
7830,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Okay. Well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punch line is ""Leaf me alone, I'm bushed!"" Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it."
7831,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Katara,Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.
7832,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Toph,It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. It hardly ever happens.
7833,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
7834,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"So, what's up?"
7835,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?"
7836,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,What do you mean? Who was captured?
7837,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where they might be."
7838,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,I can't tell you.
7839,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,What? Why not?
7840,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse.
7841,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,It's my dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through.
7842,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"It's not good, Sokka."
7843,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Please.
7844,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"My guess is, they were taken to the Boiling Rock."
7845,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,What's that?
7846,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,The highest security prison in the Fire Nation. It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. It's inescapable.
7847,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"So, where is this place?"
7848,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Why do you need to know? What are you planning?
7849,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Nothing. Boy, you're so paranoid."
7850,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.
7851,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Thanks, Zuko. Just knowing makes me feel better."
7852,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Yeah, I'm sure it does."
7853,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Shhh.
7854,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Not up to anything, huh?"
7855,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?"
7856,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,I'm never happy.
7857,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Look, I ''have'' to do this. The invasion plan was ''my'' idea, it was ''my'' decision to stay when things were going wrong. It's ''my'' mistake, and it's ''my'' job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko."
7858,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you."
7859,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,No. I have to do this alone.
7860,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares. We'll take my war balloon."
7861,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Toph,What does it say?
7862,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Katara,"""Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko."" One more thing. ""Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko."""
7863,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Aang,"Nobody else has homework. One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ..."
7864,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Pretty clouds.
7865,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Yeah ... fluffy. What?
7866,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons."
7867,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,No kidding.
7868,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Yep, a balloon ... but for war."
7869,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war."
7870,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Yeah, it seems to run in the family."
7871,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that."
7872,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"I know, I know, you've changed."
7873,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,I meant my uncle. He was more of a father to me. And I really let him down.
7874,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard.
7875,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,It wasn't that hard.
7876,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?
7877,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Well, I did have a girlfriend. Mai."
7878,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?
7879,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Yeah. Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.
7880,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,My first girlfriend turned into the moon.
7881,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"That's rough, buddy."
7882,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"There it is! There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught."
7883,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,We're going down! The balloon's not working anymore!
7884,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!
7885,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,So what are we supposed to do?
7886,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,I don't know! Crash-landing?
7887,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?
7888,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.
7889,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?
7890,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,My dad might be here! I had to come and see!
7891,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Uncle always said I never thought things through. But this ... this is just crazy!
7892,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I ''always'' think things through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So there."
7893,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,What are you doing?
7894,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it."
7895,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,I hope you know what you're doing. There's no turning back now.
7896,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,I hope these disguises work.
7897,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.
7898,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Male guard,Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard. Come on.
7899,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,I didn't do anything! I'm going back to my cell.
7900,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,"Stop right there, Chit Sang."
7901,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,We can't blow our cover.
7902,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,I've had it with your unruly behavior!
7903,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,What did I do?
7904,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,He wants to know what he did. Isn't that cute?
7905,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Uh, very cute, sir."
7906,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Super cute.
7907,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,"You didn't bow down when I walked by, Chit Sang!"
7908,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,What? That's not a prison rule.
7909,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,Do it!
7910,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,Make me.
7911,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,"Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited. You're going in the cooler. You! Help me take him in."
7912,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Meet back here in an hour.
7913,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,The warden will deal with you soon. Can you believe this guy?
7914,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Prisoners! Am I right?
7915,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,Ugh. Tell me about it.
7916,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Male guard,"Hey, new guy! I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times, but this is the lounge. Relax."
7917,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head."
7918,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Female guard,"Give it a week, he'll loosen up."
7919,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?
7920,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Female guard,"No, you can't date the female guards."
7921,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Male guard,"Trust me, you don't want to."
7922,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right? So what about war prisoners?"
7923,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,It sure looks cold in there.
7924,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,"So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better."
7925,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,I wasn't trying to escape.
7926,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Bully guard,He's lying! I saw it with my own eyes.
7927,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,"No one has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner jump in the Boiling Lake myself than let that record fall. Don't forget it. Now go back to your shivering."
7928,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Hey there, fellow guard, how goes it?"
7929,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Zuko?
7930,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Shhh! Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no Water Tribe prisoners. I'm afraid your father's not here."
7931,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"What? Are you sure, did you double-check?"
7932,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Yeah, I'm sure."
7933,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,No. No!
7934,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"I'm really sorry, Sokka."
7935,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,So we came all this way for nothing? I failed ... again.
7936,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Maybe we haven't failed after all!
7937,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,That's the spirit! I can't believe that worked. I didn't even know what I was saying.
7938,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"No, what you said made no sense at all. But look ... It's Suki!"
7939,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Guard,"Prisoners, back in your cells!"
7940,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,You mean you don't recognize me?
7941,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?"
7942,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,No. I don't know where they are. They locked me in here because I'm the leader.
7943,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out."
7944,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,I'm so glad to see you Sokka. I knew you'd come.
7945,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Female guard,Excuse me. I need to get into that cell.
7946,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Female guard,"Guard, help! I think he's an impostor! Arrest him!"
7947,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Female guard,Get him off me and arrest him!
7948,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"You're under arrest! Don't worry, I'll figure it out."
7949,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,"Well, well, well. I never thought I'd find you in here, Prince Zuko."
7950,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,How did you know who I am?
7951,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,How could I not? You broke my niece's heart.
7952,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,You're Mai's uncle? I never meant to hurt her.
7953,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,"Quiet! You're my special prisoner now. And you'd best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down, why they'd tear you to shreds."
7954,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my father to come collect a reward?
7955,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,"Oh, in due time, believe me, I intend to collect."
7956,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Oh, good, you guys have met."
7957,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,"Actually, we met a long time ago."
7958,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,We did?
7959,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,"Yeah, you kind of burned down my village."
7960,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Oh, sorry about that. Nice to see you again."
7961,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"So, listen, I think I have an escape plan. I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?"
7962,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Yeah ...
7963,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right?"
7964,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,"Just get to the point, Sokka."
7965,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water.
7966,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?
7967,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,But how are you going to get the cooler out?
7968,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"Yeah, how are you going to get the cooler out?"
7969,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,What? We didn't ... w-we didn't say that.
7970,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Yeah, you heard wrong."
7971,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"I heard you hatching an escape plan, and I want in."
7972,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,There's nothing to get in on.
7973,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg?"
7974,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"Okay, well, I come with you or the warden hears about this egg, too."
7975,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,I guess we have no choice.
7976,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Okay, you're in. Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside."
7977,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"Oh, I can get you inside."
7978,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"Hey! What are you, stupid? Watch where you're going!"
7979,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Hey, you watch who you're shoving!"
7980,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,I think you mean ''whom'' I'm shoving!
7981,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,I need backup over here!
7982,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Male guard,No firebending! Into the cooler!
7983,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.
7984,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Yes, I have ... completely."
7985,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Someone's coming!
7986,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Male guard,"Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn."
7987,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Female guard,Anybody interesting?
7988,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Male guard,"Nah, just the usual. Some robbers, a couple traitors, some war prisoners, though I did hear there might be a pirate."
7989,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Female guard,No fooling!
7990,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,War prisoners. It could be your father.
7991,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,I know.
7992,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"Well, what should we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?"
7993,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?"
7994,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"It's your call, Sokka."
7995,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"Took you guys long enough. This here's my girl and my best buddy, they're coming too."
7996,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go.
7997,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Are you sure you wanna go? You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your dad is your chance.
7998,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,Your dad?
7999,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail."
8000,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out."
8001,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,That supposed to make me feel better?
8002,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ...
8003,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Seriously, not helping."
8004,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you ''might'' fail.
8005,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"Hey, if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?"
8006,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,No. I'm staying. You guys go. You've been here long enough.
8007,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,"I'm not leaving without you, Sokka."
8008,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,"I'm staying, too."
8009,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"Not me, I'm out. Let's roll, baby."
8010,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.
8011,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Chit Sang,"Aah, this current is so slow. I can use this to paddle."
8012,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,Guards! Secure the perimeter and lock down the prisoners! Now!
8013,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,The plan failed! They're caught!
8014,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,Get the fugitives and throw them in the cooler!
8015,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Warden,One that's bolted down and not floating in the water! This is a lockdown! We have new prisoners arriving! Everything must be completely secure!
8016,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"The gondola's moving. This is it. If my dad's not there, we've risked everything for nothing."
8017,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,We had to.
8018,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Come on, come on ..."
8019,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Zuko,Is that him?
8020,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,My dad doesn't have a nose ring. Where is he? That's it? That can't be it.
8021,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Suki,"I'm sorry, Sokka."
8022,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,"Oh, no."
8023,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Male guard,"Hey, you! Get off the gondola!"
8024,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",Fire,3,54,Sokka,Dad ...
8025,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Bodyguard,Line 'em up for the warden!
8026,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Dad ... Excuse me, coming through. The warden wants me over there. Sorry!"
8027,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Oh? You'd rather look at my shoes? Then take a look!
8028,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,"I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong-willed. But don't worry, we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye!"
8029,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,"See, isn't that better? You will all do as I say or pay the price. You will all-"
8030,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,I'm fine! Get these prisoners out of my sight!
8031,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Thank goodness you're okay.
8032,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Dad, it's me."
8033,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier."
8034,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,"Are you comfortable, Chit Sang?"
8035,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,"If you're trying to get me to talk, forget it! I'm not a squealer!"
8036,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,"Well, yeah, actually I am pretty comfortable."
8037,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Are you still comfortable?
8038,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,No.
8039,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape plan. So you're gonna tell me ... who is?
8040,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,"The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here. But before I left, I met some young women who said they knew you. The ... Oshinama Fighters?"
8041,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?
8042,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,That's right.
8043,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.
8044,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,Good. We'll need all the help we can get.
8045,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,And you know Prince Zuko?
8046,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,"The son of the Fire Lord? I don't know him, but I know of him."
8047,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Well, he's here too."
8048,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,Sounds like a major problem.
8049,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Actually, he's on our side now. I know. I had the same reaction. After all he's done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help."
8050,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,"So, do you have a plan?"
8051,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. I dunno if there's another way off this island."
8052,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,"Sokka, there's no prison in the world that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses."
8053,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Then we'd better find two.
8054,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Zuko, are you there?"
8055,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,I'm here.
8056,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,I just got done talking to my dad. We came up with an escape plan together.
8057,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!
8058,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Male guard,"Well, you'll have to do that later. He's coming with us."
8059,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Why?
8060,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Female guard,"Because we have orders straight from the warden, that's why!"
8061,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit?
8062,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Female guard,"Fine, ten seconds."
8063,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Take that ... and this!
8064,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Male guard,Newbie.
8065,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Male guard,"All right, that's enough."
8066,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,What are you doing? Where are you taking me? I didn't do anything wrong!
8067,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,Mai!
8068,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,How is he?
8069,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Have you had enough time to think about what I asked?
8070,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,Yes.
8071,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,And?
8072,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,You're right. There was another person involved in the escape plan.
8073,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Who?
8074,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard. Only he's not a prison guard. He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan.
8075,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,How did you know I was here?
8076,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Mai,Because I know you so well.
8077,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,"But, how-"
8078,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,I didn't mean to -
8079,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Mai,"You didn't mean to? ""Dear Mai, I'm sorry you that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving."""
8080,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,Stop! This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation!
8081,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Mai,"Thanks Zuko, that makes me feel all better."
8082,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,"Mai, I never wanted to hurt you. But I have to do this to save my country."
8083,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Mai,Save it? You're betraying your country!
8084,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,That's not how I see it.
8085,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,"Sokka, what's going on?"
8086,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,I don't have much time. If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up. I just talked to my dad.
8087,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,That's great.
8088,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola."
8089,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,What?
8090,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.
8091,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards.
8092,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.
8093,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,"Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive."
8094,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Not if the warden ''is'' the captive. I have to go. I'll find you before we start the riot.
8095,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Male guard,"Hey, you, the warden wants to see you!"
8096,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Why?
8097,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Male guard,"I don't know, I didn't ask."
8098,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow?
8099,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Male guard,He wants to see you ... now.
8100,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Put him in the line-up.
8101,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,"One of you is an impostor who thought he could fool me. But now, that person is going to be in a lot of trouble. Who is it?"
8102,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,"That's him, warden. He's the impostor!"
8103,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Bully guard,What?
8104,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Bully guard,I am not! He's lying! He's a liar!
8105,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Bully guard,I'm telling you ... it wasn't me!
8106,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Save your breath! I know you were working together. You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.
8107,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Bully guard,That was just a coincidence!
8108,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Who told you to interrupt me?
8109,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Azula,''I'' did.
8110,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Princess Azula. Ah ... It is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison. I didn't realize you were coming.
8111,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Azula,Who is this?
8112,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt.
8113,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Bully guard,It wasn't me!
8114,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,"Quiet, you!"
8115,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Azula,You're wasting your time. That's not one of them.
8116,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,How do you know?
8117,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard."
8118,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Door guard,But we're in the middle of a lockdown.
8119,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says."
8120,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Door guard,Yeah ... you're right. We're letting them out!
8121,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,This is it! We have to start a riot.
8122,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,Okay. But how do we do that?
8123,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,I'll show you.
8124,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Tough prisoner,Hey! What'd you do that for? That hurt my feelings.
8125,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,Aren't you mad at me?
8126,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Tough prisoner,"Uh, well, normally I would be, but I've been learning to control my anger."
8127,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,This isn't working.
8128,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,"Hey you! You're lucky I didn't rat you out, but my generosity comes with a price. I know you're planning another escape attempt, and I want in."
8129,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot. You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?"
8130,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,A prison riot? Please. Hey! Riot!
8131,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,Impressive.
8132,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Tough prisoner,Forget about controlling my anger ... let's riot!
8133,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Who let these prisoners into the yard? This is supposed to be a lockdown!
8134,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Mai,I don't need any protection.
8135,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Mai,Get off of me!
8136,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas!"
8137,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,And how do we do that?
8138,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,I'm not sure.
8139,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,I thought you thought this through!
8140,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!
8141,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,"Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important!"
8142,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,"Hey, uh, fellas. I think your girlfriend's taking care of it."
8143,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,You wouldn't dare.
8144,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,That's some girl.
8145,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Tell me about it.
8146,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,We're almost there!
8147,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,Back off! We've got the warden! Let's go!
8148,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,Everyone in!
8149,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,What are you doing?
8150,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,I'm making it so they can't stop us.
8151,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Way to think ahead.
8152,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,We're on our way!
8153,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,Wait! Who's that?
8154,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,That's a problem. It's my sister and her friend.
8155,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,This is a rematch I've been waiting for.
8156,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,Me too.
8157,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Gondola guard,There's the warden! I see him!
8158,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Warden,Cut the line!
8159,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Gondola guard,He wants us to cut the line.
8160,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Gondola guard,He knows that.
8161,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Ty Lee,They're about to cut the line!
8162,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Azula,"Then it's time to leave. Goodbye, Zuko."
8163,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,They're cutting the line! The gondola's about to go!
8164,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,I hope this thing floats.
8165,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Mai,Saving the jerk who dumped me.
8166,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,Who's that?
8167,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,It's Mai!
8168,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Azula,What is she doing?
8169,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,"Sorry, warden. Your record is officially'' broken''."
8170,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Suki,"Well, we made it out. Now what?"
8171,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Zuko, what are you doing?"
8172,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,My sister was on that island.
8173,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,"Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop!"
8174,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,What I mean is she must have come here somehow. There! That's our way out of here!
8175,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Azula,"Leave us alone. I never expected this from you. The thing I don't understand is ""Why?"". Why would you do it? You know the consequences."
8176,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Mai,I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you.
8177,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Azula,"No, ''you'' miscalculated! You should have feared me more!"
8178,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Ty Lee,Come on! Let's get out of here!
8179,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Azula,"Put them somewhere I'll never have to see their faces again, and let them rot!"
8180,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Katara,What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?
8181,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Zuko,It kind of got destroyed.
8182,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Aang,Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.
8183,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Toph,Did you at least get some good meat?
8184,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,I did. The best meat of all. The meat of friendship and fatherhood.
8185,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Chit Sang,"I'm new. What's up, everybody?"
8186,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Hakoda,"Hi, Katara."
8187,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Katara,How are you here? What is going on? Where did you go?
8188,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Sokka,We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.
8189,1,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",Fire,3,55,Toph,Seriously? You guys didn't find ''any'' meat?
8190,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Watch out!
8191,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,What are you doing?
8192,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Keeping rocks from crushing you.
8193,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now!"
8194,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,I'll take that as a thank you.
8195,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Toph,Come on! We can get out through here!
8196,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,What are you doing?
8197,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Go ahead! I'll hold them off. I think this is a family visit.
8198,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,Zuko! No!
8199,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,Come on! We've gotta get out of here!
8200,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,What are you doing here?
8201,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Azula,You mean it's not obvious yet? I am about to celebrate becoming an only child!
8202,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,I can't get him to go in there! Appa hates tunnels!
8203,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here."
8204,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,We'll have to find a way!
8205,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,We need to split up. Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.
8206,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,No! The Fire Nation can't separate our family again!
8207,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Hakoda,It'll be okay. It's not forever.
8208,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Toph,I can clear that away and we can fly out through there!
8209,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Suki,"Um, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction ..."
8210,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,We'll get through. Let's go.
8211,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,She's ... not gonna make it ... Of course she did.
8212,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it?"
8213,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you."
8214,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Ha, ha."
8215,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?"
8216,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Team Avatar,Hear! Hear!
8217,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,I'm touched. I don't deserve this.
8218,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Yeah, no kidding."
8219,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,What's with her?
8220,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,I wish I knew.
8221,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,What's with him?
8222,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,This isn't fair! Everyone else seems to trust me now! What is it with you?
8223,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,What can I do to make it up to you?
8224,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. Or, I know! You could bring my mother back!"
8225,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Suki,"Oops, wrong tent!"
8226,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"Sorry, do you need to talk to Sokka, too?"
8227,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Suki,"Nope, not me!"
8228,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"Well, hello ... Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different? So what's on your mind?"
8229,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"Your sister. She hates me! And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me."
8230,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't ''hate'' anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!"
8231,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of nowhere, but I want you to tell me what happened to your mother."
8232,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,What? Why would you want to know that?
8233,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se, and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow she's connected her anger at that to her anger at me."
8234,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,It's not a day I like to remember.
8235,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Young Katara,I'm going to find Mom!
8236,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid. We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off. As quickly as they came, they just left."
8237,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened. I didn't know we had lost our mother."
8238,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Wait. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village? Like what the lead ship looked like?
8239,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,Yeah ... sea ravens. The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.
8240,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"The symbol of the Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka."
8241,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,No problem. Thanks for stopping by! I'd thought he'd never leave. Suki!
8242,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,You look terrible.
8243,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,I waited out here all night.
8244,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,What do you want?
8245,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"I know who killed your mother, and I'm going to help you find him."
8246,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,I need to borrow Appa.
8247,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?
8248,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Yes, it is."
8249,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,Oh. What's going on?
8250,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,We're going to find the man who took my mother from me.
8251,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it and I know how to find him.
8252,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish?
8253,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand."
8254,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?
8255,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"She needs this, Aang. This is about getting closure and justice."
8256,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge.
8257,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Fine, maybe it is! Maybe that's what I need! Maybe that's what he deserves!"
8258,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"Katara, you sound like Jet."
8259,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"It's not the same! Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster."
8260,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right."
8261,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,Then you didn't love her the way I did!
8262,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,Katara!
8263,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself."
8264,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"That's cute, but this isn't air temple preschool. It's the real world."
8265,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice."
8266,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness."
8267,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,That's the same as doing nothing!
8268,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"No, it's not. It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive."
8269,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"It's not just hard, it's impossible."
8270,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,So you were just gonna take Appa anyway?
8271,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,Yes.
8272,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"It's okay, because I forgive you. That give you any ideas?"
8273,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,Don't try to stop us.
8274,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him."
8275,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"Okay, we'll be sure to do that, guru goody-goody."
8276,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"You know, you're pretty wise for a kid."
8277,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"Thanks, Sokka."
8278,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"Usually it's annoying, but right now, I'm impressed."
8279,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,I appreciate that.
8280,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Sokka,"So, can I borrow Momo for a week?"
8281,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,Why do you need Momo?
8282,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower. All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk. And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed.
8283,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"Not exactly. We need to be stealthy and make sure no one spots us, otherwise they'll warn the Southern Raiders long before we reach them."
8284,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Whaletail Island, here we come."
8285,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,You should get some rest. We'll be there in a few hours. You'll need all your strength.
8286,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Oh, don't you worry about my strength. I have plenty. I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came."
8287,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Young Katara,I'm going to find Mom.
8288,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Young Katara,Mom!
8289,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Kya,Just let her go and I'll give you the information you want.
8290,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,You heard your mother. Get out of here!
8291,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Young Katara,"Mommy, I'm scared."
8292,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Kya,"Go find your dad, sweetie. I'll handle this."
8293,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,I ran as fast as I could.
8294,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Young Katara,"Dad, Dad! Please, I think Mom's in trouble! There's a man in our house!"
8295,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Hakoda,Kya!
8296,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"But we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone. And so was she."
8297,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Your mother was a brave woman.
8298,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,I know.
8299,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,There! See those sea raven flags? It's the Southern Raiders.
8300,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,Let's do this.
8301,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Soldier,"So there I was, and I was like, 'You know ...'"
8302,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"This is it, Katara. Are you ready to face him?"
8303,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Southern Raiders commander,Who are you?
8304,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"You don't remember her? You will soon, trust me."
8305,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Southern Raiders commander,What's ... happening to me?
8306,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Think back. Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe.
8307,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Southern Raiders commander,"I don't know what you're talking about. Please, I don't know!"
8308,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Don't lie! You look her in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did.
8309,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,It's not him. He's not the man.
8310,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,What? What do you mean he's not? He's the leader of the Southern Raiders! He has to be the guy!
8311,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,"If you're not the man we're looking for, who is?"
8312,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Southern Raiders commander,You must be looking for Yon Rha. He retired four years ago.
8313,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha's mother,"Yon Rha! You lazy piece of work, I need something."
8314,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,"Yes, Mother. What is it?"
8315,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha's mother,The tomato-carrots from your garden are too hard for my gums. I need something soft and juicy!
8316,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,Would you like something else from the garden? I would be happy to ...
8317,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,Hello? Did you see someone?
8318,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,Hello? Is someone there?
8319,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,That was him. That was the monster.
8320,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,Nobody sneaks up on me without getting burned!
8321,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,We weren't behind the bush. And I wouldn't try firebending again!
8322,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,"Whoever you are, take my money. Take whatever you want. I'll cooperate."
8323,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,Do you know who I am?
8324,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,No. I'm not sure.
8325,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it! Why don't you take a closer look?"
8326,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,"Yes, yes, I remember you now. You're that little Water Tribe girl."
8327,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Kya,Just let her go and I'll give you the information you want.
8328,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,You heard your mother. Get out of here!
8329,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Young Katara,"Mommy, I'm scared."
8330,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Kya,"Go find your dad, sweetie. I'll handle this."
8331,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,"Now tell me, who is it? Who's the waterbender?"
8332,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Kya,There are no waterbenders here. The Fire Nation took them all away a long time ago.
8333,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,You're lying. My source says there's one waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe. We're not leaving until we find the waterbender!
8334,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Kya,"If I tell you, do you promise to leave the rest of the village alone? It's me. Take me as your prisoner."
8335,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,I'm afraid I'm not taking prisoners today ...
8336,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,She lied to you! She was protecting the last waterbender!
8337,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,What? Who?
8338,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,Me!
8339,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,"I did a bad thing! I know I did and you deserve revenge, so why don't you take ''my'' mother? That would be fair!"
8340,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand. There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty."
8341,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Yon Rha,"Please, spare me!"
8342,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,But as much as I hate you ... I just can't do it.
8343,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,Katara? Are you okay?
8344,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,I'm doing fine.
8345,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,"Zuko told me what you did. Or what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you."
8346,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,"I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him, but I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or because I'm strong enough not to."
8347,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,You did the right thing. Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing.
8348,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Katara,But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him. But I am ready to forgive you.
8349,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,You were right about what Katara needed. Violence wasn't the answer.
8350,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Aang,It never is.
8351,1,The Southern Raiders,Fire,3,56,Zuko,Then I have a question for you. What are you gonna do when you face my father?
8352,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,Doesn't it seem kind of weird that we're hiding from the Fire Lord in his own house?
8353,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,"I told you, my father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. It's the last place anyone would think to look for us."
8354,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,You guys are not gonna believe this! There's a play about us.
8355,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,We were just in town and we found this poster!
8356,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,What? How is that possible?
8357,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"Listen to this ... ""''The Boy in the Iceberg'' is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu-on Tim, who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar, from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se. His sources include singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war, and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage."""
8358,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,"""Brought to you by the critically acclaimed Ember Island Players."""
8359,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,Ugh! My mother used to take us to see them. They butchered ''Love Amongst the Dragons'' every year!
8360,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?"
8361,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,Just sit next to me. What's the big deal?
8362,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"I was just, I wanted to ... okay."
8363,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,Why are we sitting in the nosebleed section? My feet can't see a thing from up here!
8364,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening."
8365,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"Sokka, my only brother! We constantly roam these icy South Pole seas, and yet never do we find anything fulfilling!"
8366,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,All I want is a full feeling in my stomach! I'm starving!
8367,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,Is food the only thing on your mind?
8368,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,"Well, I'm trying to get it out of my mind and into my mouth! I'm starving!"
8369,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,I think he's got you pegged!
8370,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"Every day, the world awaits a beacon to guide us, yet none appears! Still, we cannot give up hope! For hope, is all we have! And we must never relinquish it, even ... even to our dying breath!"
8371,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Well, that's just silly. I don't sound like that."
8372,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,Oh man! This writer's a genius!
8373,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"It appears to be someone frozen in ice, perhaps for a hundred years."
8374,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,But who? Who is the boy in the iceberg?
8375,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,Waterbend! Hi-yah!
8376,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"Who are you, frozen boy?"
8377,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"Wait, is that a woman playing me?"
8378,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"An airbender! My heart is so full of hope, that it's making me tearbend!"
8379,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,"My stomach is so empty, that it's making ''me'' tearbend! I need meat!"
8380,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,But wait! Is that a platter of meaty dumplings?
8381,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,Did I mention that I'm an incurable prankster?
8382,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,I don't do that! That's not what I'm like! And I'm ''not'' a woman!
8383,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes!"
8384,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Iroh,"Prince Zuko, you ''must'' try this cake!"
8385,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,I don't have time to stuff my face! I must capture the Avatar to regain my honor!
8386,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Iroh,"Well, while you do that, maybe I'll capture another slice."
8387,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,You sicken me!
8388,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,They make me look totally stiff and humorless.
8389,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on."
8390,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Iroh,Let's forget about the Avatar and get massages!
8391,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,Ugh.
8392,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,Does this dress make my butt look fat?
8393,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Bumi,"Riddles and challenges you must face, if you are ever to leave this place!"
8394,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,Ugh! Oh!
8395,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,Why did you have to steal that waterbending scroll?
8396,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,It just gave me so much hope!
8397,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,"The Avatar is mine! Wait, who's coming?"
8398,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Blue Spirit,"I'm the Blue Spirit, the scourge of the Fire Nation, here to save the Avatar!"
8399,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,My hero!
8400,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Jet,"Don't cry, baby! Jet will wipe out that nasty town for you!"
8401,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"Oh Jet, you're ''so'' bad."
8402,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,Look! It's the Great Divide! The biggest canyon in the Earth Kingdom!
8403,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,"Eh, let's keep flying."
8404,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,"Don't go, Yue! You're the only woman who has taken my mind off of food! Wait, did you have pickled fish for dinner?"
8405,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Yue,"Goodbye, Sokka! I have important moon duties to take care of! And yes, I did have pickled fish!"
8406,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,You never told me you made out with a Moon Spirit.
8407,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,Shhh! I'm trying to watch!
8408,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,The Avatar is back to save the day! Yay!
8409,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,Ugh!
8410,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,"So far, this intermission is the best part of the play."
8411,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time!"
8412,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,"Yeah, you tell bad jokes about plenty of other topics."
8413,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,I know!
8414,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,At least the Sokka actor kind of looks like you. That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all!
8415,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys."
8416,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,Argh!
8417,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Relax, Aang. They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time. What?"
8418,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"Yeah, that's not you at all."
8419,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"Listen friends, it's obvious that the playwright did his research. I know it must hurt, but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth."
8420,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"Well, here we are in the Earth Kingdom!"
8421,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,I'd better have a look around to see if I can find an earthbending teacher!
8422,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"This is it, this must be where I come in!"
8423,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,"I flew all over town, but I couldn't find a single earthbending master!"
8424,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,'' Here it comes ...
8425,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Toph,"You can't find an earthbending master in the sky, you have to look underground!"
8426,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,Who are you?
8427,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Toph,"My name's Toph, because it sounds like tough, and that's just what I am!"
8428,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"Wait a minute, '' I sound like a guy. A really buff guy."
8429,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth. It hurts, doesn't it?"
8430,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,Are you kidding me? I wouldn't have cast it any other way! At least it's not a flying bald lady!
8431,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,"So, you're blind?"
8432,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Iroh,"Zuko, it's time we had a talk ... about your hair, it's gone too far!"
8433,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,Maybe it's best if we ... split ... up!
8434,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,"Azula, my sister, what are you doing here?"
8435,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,"You caught me. Wait, what's that? I think it's your honor!"
8436,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,Where?
8437,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"She escaped, but ''how''?"
8438,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,"If she continues drilling, this wall will come down for sure!"
8439,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,"Haha, yes! Continue drilling! The city of Ba Sing Se can hide no longer!"
8440,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,"No, Jet! What did they do to you?"
8441,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Jet,Must ... serve ... Earth King! Must ... destroy!
8442,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,Did Jet just ... die?
8443,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"You know, it was really unclear."
8444,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"I have to admit Prince Zuko, I ''really'' find you attractive!"
8445,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,You don't have to make fun of me.
8446,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,But I mean it! I've had eyes for you since the day you first captured me!
8447,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,"Wait, I thought you were the Avatar's girl!"
8448,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"The Avatar? Why, he's like a little brother to me! I certainly don't think of him in a romantic way. Besides, how could he ever find out about ... this?"
8449,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"Oh, you're getting up? Can you get me some fire flakes? Ooh, and fire gummies!"
8450,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,"Well, my brother, what's it going to be? Your nation, or a life of treachery?"
8451,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Iroh,"Choose treachery, it's more fun!"
8452,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,No way!
8453,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,"I hate you, Uncle! You smell, and I hate you for all time!"
8454,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"You didn't really say that, did you?"
8455,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,I might as well have.
8456,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,"Avatar State, yip yip!"
8457,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,Not if my lightning can help it!
8458,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,The Avatar is no more!
8459,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,"It seems like every time there's a big battle, you guys barely make it out alive. I mean, you guys lose a lot!"
8460,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did!"
8461,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,Are you trying to get on my bad side?
8462,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,I'm just saying ...
8463,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,Does anyone know where Aang is?
8464,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"He left to get me fire gummies, like, ten minutes ago. And I'm still waiting!"
8465,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,I'm gonna check outside.
8466,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,Are you all right?
8467,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"No, I'm not! I hate this play!"
8468,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"I know it's upsetting, but it sounds like you're overreacting."
8469,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State right now!"
8470,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage? I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me."
8471,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,I'm an elite warrior who's trained for many years in the art of stealth. I think I could get you backstage!
8472,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"Geez, everyone's getting so upset about their characters. Even you seem more down than usual, and that's saying something!"
8473,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,"You don't get it, it's different for you. You get a muscly version of yourself, taking down ten bad guys at once, and making sassy remarks."
8474,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"Yeah, that's pretty great!"
8475,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,"But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life, and shoves them back in my face. My uncle, he's always been on my side, even when things were bad. He was there for me, he taught me so much, and how do I repay him? With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret, and I may never get to redeem myself."
8476,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"You have redeemed yourself to your uncle. You don't realize it, but you already have."
8477,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,How do you know?
8478,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"Because I once had a long conversation with the guy, and all he would talk about was you."
8479,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,Really?
8480,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"Yeah, and it was kind of annoying."
8481,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,"Oh, sorry."
8482,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,"But it was also very sweet. All your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path, and see the light. Now you're here with us. He'd be proud."
8483,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,Ow! What was that for?
8484,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,That's how I show affection.
8485,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Young boy,"Your Zuko costume's pretty good, but your scar's on the wrong side."
8486,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,The scar's not on the wrong side!
8487,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,He's coming this way!
8488,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,Can I help you?
8489,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"Actually, I think I can help you. I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be."
8490,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,"Aww no, another fan with ideas."
8491,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,Just hear me out. Here's something I think the real Sokka would say. What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages? A cabbage patch!
8492,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,"That's actually pretty good! Let me see those! ""A rocky relationship"" ... not bad!"
8493,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases, especially before an attack. Something like ... ""Flying kick-a-pow!""."
8494,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,"Who are you, anyway?"
8495,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,I'm just a guy who likes comedy.
8496,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"Katara, did you really mean what you said in there?"
8497,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,In where? What are you talking about?
8498,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me."
8499,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,I didn't say that. An actor said that.
8500,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"But it's true, isn't it? We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together. But we're not."
8501,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Aang, I don't know."
8502,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,Why don't you know?
8503,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time."
8504,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"Well, when is the right time?"
8505,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,"Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused."
8506,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,I just said I was confused! I'm going inside.
8507,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,"Ugh, I'm such an idiot!"
8508,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died. Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start! Shhh!"
8509,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Katara,"I just wanted to let you know, Aang, that I'll always love you. Like a brother."
8510,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,I wouldn't want it any other way!
8511,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,"Hey Toph, would you say you and Aang have a ""rocky relationship""?"
8512,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,I told him to say that!
8513,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,I hope everyone's ready for the Invasion! Slap-a-pow!
8514,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,"We finally made it to the Royal Palace, but no one's home!"
8515,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,"Actually, I'm home, and I want to join you!"
8516,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Sokka,I guess we have no choice. Come on!
8517,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,I guess that's it. The play's caught up to the present now.
8518,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,"Wait, the play's not over!"
8519,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,"But it is over, unless ... this is the future."
8520,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Ozai,"With the energy harnessed from that comet, no one will be able to stop ... the Fire Nation!"
8521,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,"Father, Zuko and the Avatar are at the Palace. They're trying to stop you!"
8522,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Ozai,You take care of Zuko. I shall face the Avatar myself!
8523,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,"Aang! You find the Fire Lord, I'll hold her off!"
8524,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,You are no longer my brother. You are an enemy!
8525,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,No! I am the rightful heir to the throne!
8526,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,We'll see!
8527,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Zuko,Honor!
8528,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Ozai,"So, you have mastered all four elements?"
8529,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,"Yeah, and now you're going down!"
8530,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Ozai,"No! It is ''you'' who are going down! You see, you are too late! The comet is already here, and I'm unstoppable!"
8531,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Aang,Noooo ...!
8532,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actress Azula,"It is over, Father. We've done it!"
8533,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Actor Ozai,"Yes! We have done it! The dreams of my father, and my father's father, have now been realized! The world ... is ... mine!"
8534,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Zuko,That ... wasn't a good play.
8535,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Aang,I'll say.
8536,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Katara,No kidding.
8537,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Suki,Horrible.
8538,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Toph,You said it.
8539,1,The Ember Island Players,Fire,3,57,Sokka,But the effects were decent.
8540,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,More ferocious! Imagine striking through your opponent's heart!
8541,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,I'm trying.
8542,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,Who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice?
8543,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Ooh, ooh! Me, me, me!"
8544,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Hey! Your lesson's not over yet! Get back here!
8545,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Suki,"Come on, Zuko. Just take a break. What's the big deal?"
8546,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"Fine! If you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day, then go ahead!"
8547,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,Maybe Zuko's right. Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know just the thing to change all that. Beach party!
8548,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,Check out my Appa sand sculpture.
8549,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"Not bad, baldy, but I've been working on my sandbending. You're gonna love this."
8550,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Whoa! Wow, you've even made a little Earth King and Bosco."
8551,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"Try and top ''that'', Sokka."
8552,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,Ta da!
8553,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,Is that a blubbering blob monster?
8554,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"No, it's Suki!"
8555,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this."
8556,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Suki,I think it's sweet.
8557,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,But it doesn't even look like- Aah!
8558,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,What are you doing?
8559,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Teaching you a lesson!
8560,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,What happened?
8561,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki and he destroyed it! Oh, and he's attacking Aang."
8562,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!
8563,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Go ahead and do it!
8564,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,Enough!
8565,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,What's wrong with you? You could have hurt Aang!
8566,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,What's wrong with ''me''? What's wrong with all of you? How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet is only three days away? Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?
8567,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,About Sozin's Comet ... I was actually gonna wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.
8568,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,After?
8569,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,I'm not ready. I need more time to master firebending.
8570,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too."
8571,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"So, you all knew Aang was going to wait?"
8572,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord now, he's going to lose. No offense."
8573,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the Comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the War, but they pretty much won the War when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse."
8574,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"You're wrong. It's about to get worse than you can even imagine. The day before the eclipse, my father asked me to attend an important war meeting. It was what I dreamed about for so many years. My father had finally accepted me back."
8575,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,"Welcome, Prince Zuko. We waited for you. General Shinu, your report."
8576,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Shinu,"Thank you, sir. Ba Sing Se is still under our control. However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the Earth Kingdom."
8577,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,What is your recommendation?
8578,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Shinu,"Our army is spread too thin, but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into the Earth Kingdom."
8579,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,"Hmm. Prince Zuko, you've been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions?"
8580,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything, as long as they have hope."
8581,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,"Yes, you're right. We need to destroy their hope."
8582,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"Well, that's not exactly what I-"
8583,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,''I'' think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground.
8584,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,"Yes ... Yes you're right, Azula. Sozin's Comet is almost upon us, and on that day, it will endow us with the strength and power of a hundred suns. No bender will stand a chance against us."
8585,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Shinu,"What are you suggesting, sir?"
8586,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan, but I'm ashamed to say I didn't. My whole life, I struggled to gain my father's love and acceptance, but once I had it, I realized I'd lost myself getting there. I'd forgotten who I was."
8587,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,I can't believe this.
8588,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil."
8589,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,What am I gonna do?
8590,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"I know you're scared, and I know you're not ready to save the world, but if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes, there won't be a world to save anymore."
8591,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,Why didn't you tell me about your dad's crazy plan sooner?
8592,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,I didn't think I had to. I assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told ''me'' you decided to wait.
8593,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"This is bad. This is really, really bad."
8594,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Aang, you don't have to do this alone."
8595,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"Yeah, if we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down."
8596,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,All right! Team Avatar is back! Air. Water. Earth. Fire. Fan and sword!
8597,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together, but I wouldn't want to do it any other way."
8598,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,Yeah.
8599,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,All right.
8600,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs."
8601,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"There's one technique you need to know before facing my father - how to redirect lightning. If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You turn your opponents' energy against them."
8602,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,That's like waterbending.
8603,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Exactly. My uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.
8604,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"So, have ''you'' ever redirected lightning before?"
8605,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"Once, against my father."
8606,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,What did it feel like?
8607,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"Exhilarating ... but terrifying. You feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body, but you know if you make the wrong move, it's over."
8608,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Well, not ''over'' over. I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action, am I right?"
8609,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Actually, I used it all up after Azula shot you."
8610,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,Oh.
8611,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life before he takes yours.
8612,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Yeah, I'll just do that."
8613,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Gather round, Team Avatar. In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect. First, Suki and I will draw his fire. Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense, and while the Melon Lord is distracted, Aang swoops in ... and bam! He delivers the final blow."
8614,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,Uh ... what about me?
8615,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces."
8616,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?
8617,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.
8618,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,Sweetness.
8619,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,Mwah-ha-ha-ha!
8620,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Watch it, Toph!"
8621,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,I am not Toph. I am Melon Lord! Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
8622,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Now, Aang!"
8623,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,What are you waiting for? Take him out!
8624,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,I can't.
8625,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"What's wrong with you? If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now."
8626,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself."
8627,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"There, that's how it's done."
8628,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,I have a surprise for everyone!
8629,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru!
8630,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Uh, no. I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this! Look at baby Zuko. Isn't he cute?"
8631,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Oh, lighten up. I'm just teasing."
8632,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,That's not me. It's my father.
8633,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Suki,But he looks so sweet and innocent.
8634,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers."
8635,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,But he's still a human being.
8636,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,You're going to defend him?
8637,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"No, I agree with you. Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way."
8638,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Like what?
8639,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"I don't know. Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore."
8640,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again."
8641,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,Do you really think that would work?
8642,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,No!
8643,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,This goes against everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like.
8644,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Sure you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you."
8645,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Aang, we do understand. It's just ..."
8646,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Just what, Katara? What?"
8647,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,We're trying to help!
8648,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it!"
8649,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Aang, don't walk away from this."
8650,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself.
8651,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Hey, Momo. I don't suppose ''you'' know what I should do. I didn't think so."
8652,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Okay, that's everything."
8653,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"No, it's not. Where's Aang?"
8654,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Aang? Aang!
8655,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"Come on, lazy bones, let's go."
8656,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,He left his staff. That's so strange.
8657,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach.
8658,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Look, there's his footprints. The trail ends here."
8659,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Suki,"So, he went for a midnight swim and never came back?"
8660,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,Maybe he was captured.
8661,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,I don't think so. There's no sign of a struggle.
8662,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,I bet he ran away again.
8663,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.
8664,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"Then what do ''you'' think happened to him, oh sleuthy one?"
8665,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,It's pretty obvious. Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.
8666,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?"
8667,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Oh, yeah. Forgot about that."
8668,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him.
8669,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,I'm going with Zuko! What?! Everyone else went on a life-changing field trip with Zuko. Now it's my turn.
8670,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Crowd,Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang!
8671,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Actress Aang,Avatar State! Yip-yip!
8672,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"And then when I was nine, I ran away again."
8673,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Uh-huh.
8674,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"I know I shouldn't complain. My parents gave me everything I ever asked for, but they never gave me the one thing I really wanted, their love. You know what I mean?"
8675,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang."
8676,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,This is the worst field trip ever.
8677,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either."
8678,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,No. It's like he just ... disappeared.
8679,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"Hey, wait a minute. Has anyone noticed that Momo is missing, too?"
8680,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Oh no! I knew it was only a matter of time! Appa ate Momo! Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy."
8681,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang."
8682,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,That's just what Appa wants you to think.
8683,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,"Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away."
8684,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,What should we do Zuko?
8685,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,I don't know. Why are you all looking at ''me''?
8686,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,"Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang."
8687,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar ... it's you."
8688,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there."
8689,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,Just trust me.
8690,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,Come on slowpokes! Faster!
8691,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,"Sorry I'm late, father. Good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure?"
8692,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,"There has been a change of plans, Azula."
8693,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,What?
8694,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Se alone. You will remain here in the Fire Nation.
8695,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,But I thought we were going to do this together.
8696,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,My decision is final.
8697,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,You ... you can't treat me like this! You can't treat me like Zuko!
8698,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,"Azula, silence yourself."
8699,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,But it was ''my'' idea to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!
8700,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,Azula! Listen to me. I need you here to watch over the homeland. It's a very important job that I can only entrust to you.
8701,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,Really?
8702,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,"And for your loyalty, I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord."
8703,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Azula,"Fire Lord Azula? It does seem appropriate, but what about you?"
8704,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Ozai,"Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the world will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world. From this moment on, I will be known as ... the Phoenix King."
8705,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Katara,And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?
8706,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,June.
8707,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole."
8708,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Suki,Mole? Her skin is flawless.
8709,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Sokka,"No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on."
8710,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Zuko,The shirshu. It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world. It's the one shot we have of finding him.
8711,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Toph,"I don't know who this June lady is, but I like her."
8712,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King",Fire,3,58,Aang,"Hey, Momo. I just had the strangest dream. Wait. Where are we?"
8713,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,"Hey, I remember her! She helped you attack us!"
8714,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,Yup. Back in the good old days.
8715,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,Oh great. It's Prince Pouty. Where's your creepy grandpa?
8716,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,He's my uncle. And he's not here.
8717,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,I see you worked things out with your girlfriend.
8718,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,I'm not his girlfriend!
8719,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,She's not my girlfriend!
8720,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,"Okay, okay. Sheesh. I was only teasing. So what do you want?"
8721,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,I need your help finding the Avatar.
8722,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,Hm. Doesn't sound too fun.
8723,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,I have Aang's staff.
8724,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,"Well, what does that mean?"
8725,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,Means your friend's gone.
8726,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,We know he's gone. That's why we're trying to find him.
8727,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,"No, I mean he's ''gone'' gone. He doesn't exist."
8728,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"Where are we, Momo? Maybe I'm in the Spirit World? But wait. You can see me. We could both be in the Spirit World. Nope. My bending works. Maybe if we climb to the top of the island, we can figure out where we are."
8729,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,"What do you mean Aang doesn't exist? Do you mean he's ... you know, dead?"
8730,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,"Nope. We could find him if he were dead. Wow, it's a real head-scratcher. See ya."
8731,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,Helpful. Real helpful.
8732,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,Wait. I have another idea. There's only one other person in this world who can help us face the Fire Lord. I'll be right back with a smell sample.
8733,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal? Ugh!
8734,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,I think it's kind of sweet.
8735,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,Let's do this.
8736,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,Hey! Wait up!
8737,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,We're going to Ba Sing Se?
8738,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,June,Your uncle's somewhere beyond the wall. Nyla's getting twitchy so he can't be too far. Good luck.
8739,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,It's been a long day. Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.
8740,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,It's a hexagon. It doesn't seem like normal rock. It's not made of earth. This is so strange. I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had Roku. I ''do'' have Roku!
8741,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Avatar Roku,"You're right, Aang. All the past Avatars, all their experience and wisdom, is available to you if you look deep inside yourself."
8742,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"So where am I, Roku? What is this place?"
8743,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Avatar Roku,"I ... don't know, Aang. But I see you are lost in more ways than one right now."
8744,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,I am. I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord.
8745,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,Huh?
8746,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,"Well, look who's here!"
8747,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life, but I just don't know if I can do that."
8748,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Avatar Roku,"In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint, but it backfired when Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy. If I had been more decisive and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin and stopped the war before it started. I offer you this wisdom, Aang: You must be decisive."
8749,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,What's going on? We're surrounded by old people.
8750,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,Not just any old people. These are great masters and friends of ours. Pakku.
8751,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Pakku,"It is respectful to bow to an old master, but how about a hug for your new grandfather?"
8752,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,That's so exciting! You and Gran-Gran must be so happy to have found each other again!
8753,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Pakku,I made her a new betrothal necklace and everything.
8754,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,"Welcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp!"
8755,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,How about Grand-Pakku?
8756,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Pakku,No.
8757,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,And this was Aang's first firebending teacher.
8758,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Jeong Jeong,Jeong Jeong.
8759,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,Master Piandao.
8760,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Piandao,"Hello, Sokka."
8761,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Suki,So wait. How do you all know each other?
8762,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,All old people know each other. Don't you know that?
8763,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Piandao,We're all part of the same ancient secret society. A group that transcends the divisions of the four nations.
8764,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,The Order of the White Lotus.
8765,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,That's the one.
8766,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Jeong Jeong,"The White Lotus has always been about philosophy and beauty and truth. But about a month ago, a call went out that we were needed for something important."
8767,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Pakku,"It came from a Grand Lotus: your uncle, Iroh of the Fire Nation."
8768,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,"Well, that's who we're looking for."
8769,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Piandao,Then we'll take you to him.
8770,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,Wait! Someone's missing from your group. Someone very important. Where's Momo?
8771,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,He's gone. And so is Aang.
8772,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,"Oh well. So long as they have each other, I'm sure we have nothing to worry about. Let's go!"
8773,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,Avatar Kyoshi. I need your wisdom.
8774,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Kyoshi,"In my day, Chin the Conqueror threatened to throw the world out of balance. I stopped him. And the world entered a great era of peace."
8775,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Kyoshi,"Personally, I don't really see the difference, but I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to stop Chin. I offer you this wisdom, Aang: Only justice will bring peace."
8776,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.
8777,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,"So, Bumi ... how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?"
8778,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,"Escape? I didn't escape. Everybody else escaped. There I was back in Omashu, waiting for just the right moment. I didn't know what or when, but I knew I'd know it when I knew it. An eclipse. That'll do it."
8779,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Firebender,What do you think you're doing?
8780,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,Taking back my city! You've got no firepower. And it's payback time!
8781,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Suki,Wow! You took back your whole city all by yourself!
8782,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,So what about you guys? Did you do anything interesting on the day of the eclipse?
8783,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,Nah.
8784,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,"No, not really."
8785,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,I need to look deep inside myself.
8786,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Kuruk,"I am Avatar Kuruk. When I was young, I was always a go-with-the-flow kind of Avatar. People seemed to work out their own problems, and there was peace and good times in the world. But then, I lost the woman I loved to Koh, the Face Stealer. It was my fault. If I had been more attentive and more active, I could've saved her. Aang, you must actively shape your own destiny and the destiny of the world."
8787,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Bumi,"Well, here we are. Welcome to Old People Camp."
8788,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,Where ... where is he?
8789,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Piandao,"Your uncle's in there, Prince Zuko."
8790,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,Are you okay?
8791,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,"No, I'm not okay. My uncle hates me, I know it. He loved and supported me in every way he could, and I still turned against him. How can I even face him?"
8792,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,"Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?"
8793,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life.
8794,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,Then he'll forgive you. He will.
8795,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,Uncle?
8796,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Yangchen,"I am Avatar Yangchen, young airbender."
8797,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"Avatar Yangchen, the monks always taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web."
8798,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Yangchen,Yes. All life is sacred.
8799,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"I know, I'm even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever. And I've only had to use violence for necessary defense. And I've certainly never used it to take a life."
8800,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Yangchen,"Avatar Aang, I know that you're a gentle spirit, and the monks have taught you well, but this isn't about you. This is about the world."
8801,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free.
8802,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Yangchen,"Many great and wise Air Nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment, but the Avatar can never do it. Because your sole duty is to the world. Here is my wisdom for you: Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs, and do whatever it takes to protect the world."
8803,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"I guess I don't have a choice, Momo. I have to kill the Fire Lord."
8804,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,"Uncle, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me. But I want you to know, I am so, so, sorry, Uncle. I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did. I don't know how I can ever make it up to you. But I'll- How can you forgive me so easily? I thought you would be furious with me."
8805,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you had lost your way.
8806,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,I did lose my way.
8807,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,But you found it again. And you did it by yourself. And I am so happy you found your way here.
8808,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,"It wasn't that hard, Uncle. You have a pretty strong scent."
8809,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"Wait. Is it just me, or are those mountains getting bigger?"
8810,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"They're not getting larger, They're getting closer! The whole island is moving!"
8811,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,It's amazing Momo! The biggest animal in the world! I've gotta to swim around and find its face.
8812,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,"Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar who can possibly defeat the Father Lord."
8813,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,You mean the Fire Lord.
8814,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,That's what I just said!
8815,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,Hmmm ...
8816,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,We need you to come with us!
8817,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,"No, Zuko, it won't turn out well."
8818,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,You can beat him! And we'll be there to help.
8819,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,"Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that I could, it would be the wrong way to end the war. History would see it as just more senseless violence, a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord."
8820,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,And then ... then you would come and take your rightful place on the throne?
8821,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,"No. Someone new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart and unquestionable honor. It has to be ''you'', Prince Zuko."
8822,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,Unquestionable honor? But I've made so many mistakes.
8823,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,"I'll try, Uncle."
8824,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,"Well, what if Aang doesn't come back?"
8825,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,"Sozin's Comet is arriving, and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord. When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se. Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it ''back'' from the Fire Nation, so the Earth Kingdom can be free again."
8826,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Suki,That's why you gathered the members of the White Lotus.
8827,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,"Yes. Zuko, you must return to the Fire Nation, so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order. But Azula will be there, waiting for you."
8828,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,I can handle Azula.
8829,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,Not alone! You'll need help.
8830,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,"You're right. Katara, how would you like to help me put Azula in her place?"
8831,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,It would be my pleasure.
8832,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,What about us? What's our destiny today?
8833,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,What do you think it is?
8834,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,"I think that, even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet."
8835,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Toph,"And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us."
8836,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Piandao,Nothing runs faster over land or swims quicker than a giant eel hound. The air ship base is on a small island just off the Earth Kingdom shore. You should be able to intercept the fleet within a day's journey.
8837,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Sokka,"Thank you, Master."
8838,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Zuko,"So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?"
8839,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,"After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se, I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop, and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day."
8840,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Katara,"Goodbye, General Iroh."
8841,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Iroh,"Goodbye, everyone. Today, destiny is our friend. I know it."
8842,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Aang,"A lion turtle! Maybe you can help me. Everyone, even my own past lives, are expecting me to end someone's life. But I don't know if I can do it."
8843,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Lion turtle,"The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed. Since beginningless time, darkness thrives in the void but always yields to purifying light."
8844,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Lion turtle,Wait for him. He will come.
8845,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 2: The Old Masters",Fire,3,59,Ozai,"It's time for this world to end in fire, and for a new world to be born from the ashes."
8846,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Katara,"Zuko, don't worry. We can take Azula."
8847,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Zuko,It's not her I'm worried about. I'm worried about Aang. What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my father? What if he loses?
8848,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Katara,Aang won't lose. He's gonna come back. He has to.
8849,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,What am I holding?
8850,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Banished servant,"A cherry pit, Princess."
8851,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,Correct. And what day is this?
8852,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Banished servant,It is the day of your coronation.
8853,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"Yes, it is. So, please. Tell me why, on the most important day of my life, you've decided to leave a pit in my cherry?"
8854,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,Small? Do you realize what could've happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?
8855,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Banished servant,I suppose you could've ... choked?
8856,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"Yes, then you will understand the severity of your crime."
8857,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Banished servant,"I understand, Princess. Please, forgive me."
8858,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"Oh very well, since it is a special day, I will show mercy. You are banished. Leave this palace immediately."
8859,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,What are you all looking at? I have two feet that need scrubbing. And make sure you get in between the toes. I won't have my first day as Fire Lord marred by poor foot hygiene.
8860,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Suki,"It's weird to say, but the comet actually looks beautiful."
8861,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph,Too bad the Fire Lord's about to use it to destroy the world.
8862,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,We're too late! The fleet's already taking off!
8863,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph,"Then we're taking off, too! Where's the closest airship?"
8864,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,It's right ...
8865,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Head of Dai Li,"You sent for us, Princess. Is everything all right?"
8866,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"Actually, everything's not all right! Do you know how long it took you to get here?"
8867,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Head of Dai Li,"Uh ... a few minutes, I guess."
8868,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"Five, to be precise, in which time an assassin could've snuck in, done away with me and been on his merry way!"
8869,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Head of Dai Li,"My apologies, Princess."
8870,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord? With tardiness and disloyalty?
8871,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Head of Dai Li,The Dai Li would never betray you!
8872,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,And I'm sure that's just what you told Long Feng before you turned against him and joined me! You're all banished!
8873,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Head of Dai Li,But ...
8874,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,Goodbye!
8875,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,Please send in the next group on your way out!
8876,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,Sshhh ...
8877,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph,That's how it's done!
8878,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,"Good work, Toph! Time to take control of the ship, take the wheel."
8879,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph,That's a great idea! Let the blind girl steer the giant airship!
8880,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,I was talking to Suki.
8881,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph,That would make a lot more sense.
8882,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Suki,What are we going to do about the rest of the crew?
8883,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,"Take us down closer to the water. I've got an idea. Attention, crew, this is your captain speaking. Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and sweet cream. We have a very special birthday to celebrate."
8884,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Qin Lee,"Hey, I'm Qin Lee. I work up in communications."
8885,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Engineer,"Oh, hi. I work down in the engine room. That's probably why we never met before. Big airship, you know?"
8886,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Qin Lee,Yep.
8887,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Engineer,"So, do you know whose birthday it is?"
8888,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Crew member,I can't believe the captain remembered my birthday! He really does care!
8889,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Engineer,Happy birthday.
8890,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,"Fire Lord Ozai, here we come."
8891,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Li,"Azula, we heard what happened. Why have you banished all your servants?"
8892,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Lo,All your Dai Li agents ...
8893,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Li,And the Imperial Firebenders?
8894,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"None of them could be trusted. Sooner or later, they all would have betrayed me. Just like Mai and Ty Lee did."
8895,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Lo and Li,"Azula, we are concerned for you and your well-being."
8896,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Lo,I'm sure you will. But considering everything that has happened today ...
8897,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Li,Perhaps it's best if you postponed your coronation.
8898,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,What? Which one of you just said that?
8899,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,What a shame ... there's only one way to resolve this. You two must duel each other. I order you to fight an Agni Kai!
8900,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Lo,But ...
8901,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Lo and Li,We're not firebenders.
8902,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"All right, fine. Lo, you're banished. Li, you can stay."
8903,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Li,"But, I'm Li. So who's banished?"
8904,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Bumi,"Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus is here."
8905,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Pakku,Here to set you free.
8906,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Iroh,Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power.
8907,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"All right hair, it's time to face your doom."
8908,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Ursa,"What a shame, you always had such beautiful hair."
8909,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Ursa,I didn't want to miss my own daughter's coronation.
8910,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,Don't pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me. You think I'm a monster.
8911,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,Well what choice do I have?! Trust is for fools. Fear is the only reliable way. Even you fear me.
8912,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Ursa,"No. I love you, Azula. I do."
8913,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,We're not gonna catch up to him in time.
8914,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Suki,No ...
8915,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Aang,"Momo, time for you to go."
8916,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,It's Aang! He's back!
8917,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Ozai,"After generations of Fire Lords failed to find you, now the universe delivers you to me as an act of providence."
8918,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Aang,''Please'' listen to me. We don't have to fight. You have the power to end it here and stop what you're doing.
8919,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Ozai,You are right. I do have the power. I have ''all'' the power in the world!
8920,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,"Go, Aang! Airbending slice!"
8921,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Suki,Shouldn't we be helping him?
8922,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,The Fire Lord is Aang's fight. We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom.
8923,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph,"And how do we do that, Captain Boomerang? I can't see outside of this floating hunk of metal."
8924,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph,"Whoa. That's ''a lot'' of fire, isn't it."
8925,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,"It's gonna be a rough ride! We need to get to the top of this thing, ''fast.''"
8926,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Suki,Then what?
8927,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,"Watch each other's backs, and if we make it that far, I'll let you know."
8928,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Sokka,Suki!
8929,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Suki,I'm okay! Just finish the mission!
8930,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph,"Sokka, I think we've gotta ..."
8931,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Toph and Sokka,Jump!
8932,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Fire Sage,"By decree of Phoenix King Ozai, I now crown you Fire Lord ..."
8933,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,What are you waiting for? Do it!
8934,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Zuko,"Sorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today. ''I'' am."
8935,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,You're hilarious.
8936,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Katara,And you're going down.
8937,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"Wait. You want to be Fire Lord? Fine. Let's settle this. Just you and me, brother. The showdown that was always meant to be. Agni Kai!"
8938,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Zuko,You're on.
8939,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Katara,"What are you doing? She's playing you. She knows she can't take us both, so she's trying to separate us."
8940,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Zuko,I know. But I can take her this time.
8941,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Katara,But even ''you'' admitted to your uncle that you would need help facing Azula.
8942,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"I'm sorry it has to end this way, ''brother''."
8943,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Zuko,No you're not.
8944,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Zuko,No lightning today? What's the matter? Afraid I'll redirect it?
8945,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Azula,"Oh, I'll ''show'' you lightning!"
8946,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Zuko,No!
8947,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Katara,Zuko!
8948,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno",Fire,3,60,Ozai,"You're weak, just like the rest of your people! They did not deserve to exist in this world ... in my world! Prepare to join them. Prepare to die!"
8949,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,"Come on out, Avatar! You can't hide in there forever!"
8950,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others."
8951,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Toph,Got it!
8952,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?
8953,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Toph,You could stand to mention it more.
8954,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,My leg! Hang on Toph!
8955,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Toph,"Aye, aye, Captain."
8956,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"Bye, space sword."
8957,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph. It looks like this is the end."
8958,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Toph,How did that happen? Did boomerang come back?
8959,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"No, Suki did."
8960,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,"Come on out, little boy. You're about to be ..."
8961,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Azula,"I'd really rather our family physician look after Little Zuzu if you don't mind. Zuzu, you don't look so good!"
8962,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Azula,"There you are, filthy peasant!"
8963,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,"Thank you, Katara."
8964,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Katara,I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.
8965,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,"Even with all the power in the world, you are still weak!"
8966,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Lion turtle,"In the era before the Avatar, we bent not the elements but the energy within ourselves."
8967,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Lion turtle,"To bend another's energy, your own spirit must be unbendable or you will be corrupted and destroyed."
8968,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,What? What did you do to me?
8969,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Aang,I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.
8970,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"You did it! You should've seen yourself, it was amazing! You were all like and the Fire Lord was all like"
8971,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Suki,"So did you, you know ... finish the job?"
8972,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,I'm still alive.
8973,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Aang,I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away.
8974,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Toph,Wow! Who taught you that?
8975,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Aang,A giant lion turtle.
8976,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Toph,You have the craziest adventures when you disappear.
8977,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"Well, look at you, buster. Now that your firebending's gone I guess we should call you the Loser Lord."
8978,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,I am the Phoenix King!
8979,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Toph,"Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Phoenix King of Getting His Butt Whooped."
8980,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Suki,Yeah! Or how about King of the ... Guys Who ... Don't Win?
8981,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Mai,You need some help with that?
8982,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,Mai! You're okay! They let you out of prison?
8983,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Mai,My uncle pulled some strings. And it doesn't hurt when the new Fire Lord is your boyfriend.
8984,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?
8985,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Mai,I think it means I actually kind of like you. But don't ever break up with me again!
8986,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Katara and Sokka,Dad!
8987,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Hakoda,"I heard what you two did. I am the proudest father in the world. And your mother would be proud, too."
8988,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"There's my favorite warriors! I have to admit, I kind of missed the face paint. So how does it feel to be in uniform again?"
8989,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ty Lee,It feels great!
8990,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"Careful, Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again."
8991,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Suki,It's okay. She's one of us now.
8992,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ty Lee,"Yeah, the girls and I really bonded in prison. And after a few chi blocking lessons, they said I could join their group. We're going to be best friends forever."
8993,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down. And now ...
8994,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Aang,And now we're friends.
8995,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,"Yeah, we ''are ''friends."
8996,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Aang,I can't believe a year ago I was still frozen in a block of ice. The world's so different now.
8997,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,And it's gonna be even more different... when we build it together.
8998,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,"Please. The real hero is the Avatar. Today this war is finally over! I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation. And I will. The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided. But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the right path and begin a new era of love and peace."
8999,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Fire Sage,All hail Fire Lord Zuko!
9000,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,I should count myself lucky. The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lowly prison cell.
9001,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life.
9002,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,Hmph.
9003,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life. It put me on the right path. Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you.
9004,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Ozai,Why are you really here?
9005,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"Zuko, stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment. I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together."
9006,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Katara,"That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka. Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears?"
9007,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,Those are your hair loopies!
9008,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Zuko,At least you don't look like a boar-q-pine! My hair is not that spiky!
9009,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Mai,I look like a man.
9010,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Suki,And why did you paint me firebending?
9011,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Sokka,"I thought it looked more exciting that way. Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo?"
9012,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Iroh,"Hey, my belly's not that big anymore. I've really trimmed down."
9013,1,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",Fire,3,61,Toph,Well I think you all look perfect!
9014,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"Earth. Fire. Air. Water. When I was a boy, my father, Avatar Aang, told me the story of how he and his friends heroically ended the Hundred Year War. Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko transformed the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations, a society where benders and nonbenders from all over the world could live and thrive together in peace and harmony. They named the capital of this great land, Republic City. Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things in his life. But sadly, his time in this world came to an end. And like the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the Avatar began anew."
9015,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tonraq,The White Lotus has honored my family by coming. Thank you.
9016,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Senna,Welcome.
9017,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,White Lotus leader,"We have investigated many claims, both here and in the Northern Tribe. All have turned out to be false."
9018,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Senna,"Then you should be happy to know, your search has come to an end."
9019,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,White Lotus leader,What makes you so sure your daughter is ''the one''?
9020,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Senna,Korra! Please come in here!
9021,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,I'm the Avatar! You gotta deal with it!
9022,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,She's strong.
9023,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,White Lotus leader,She lacks restraint.
9024,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Woohoo! Hey, why all the doom and gloom, people? We should be celebrating! Three elements down, one to go!"
9025,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Firebending master,"You're getting ahead of yourself ''as usual'', Korra. We haven't decided if you passed your firebending test yet."
9026,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,White Lotus leader,"Ever since you were a little girl, you've excelled at the physical side of bending, but completely ''ignored'' the spiritual side. The Avatar must master both."
9027,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"I haven't ignored it, it just doesn't come as easy to me. But that's why I should start training with Tenzin immediately. He's Mister Spiritual."
9028,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,White Lotus leader,"Do you believe she's ready, Master Katara?"
9029,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,White Lotus leader,"Very well, Korra. It's time for you to begin your airbending training."
9030,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Yes! Finally! I mean, thank you all for believing in me."
9031,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Naga, you should have seen it! I kicked some firebender butt, and I passed! Tenzin will be here in a few days."
9032,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Naga, go! That a girl. Go! Go! Go!"
9033,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Meelo,"Unhand me, strange woman!"
9034,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"That's your grandmother, Meelo."
9035,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,It's so good to see all of you.
9036,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Jinora,"Gran Gran, I've been reading ''all'' about your old adventures. I've been dying to ask you: What happened to Zuko's mom?"
9037,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,"Well, Jinora, it's an ''incredible'' tale--"
9038,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Ikki,"Gran Gran, you look old. How old ''are'' you? And why is it so cold in the South Pole? Can we make a campfire, and all huddle around it, and tell scary stories, and make snowmen? And then can you make the snowmen move with waterbending and chase us? Wouldn't that be fuuun? Huh? Wouldn't it?"
9039,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"Pema, let me help you. Careful now, careful."
9040,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Pema,"Stop doting on me. I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant."
9041,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,The baby's ''strong''. I see another airbender in your future.
9042,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Pema,"All I want is one child like ''me'', a nice ''non''-bender, who doesn't blast wind in my face every five seconds."
9043,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,"Kya and Bumi certainly were, but Tenzin has always been ... rather serious."
9044,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"Mother, ''please''."
9045,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Master Tenzin, I'm ''so'' glad you're here. I can't wait to get started."
9046,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"Yes, well ..."
9047,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Pema,You're going to have to tell her sooner or later.
9048,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Tell me what?
9049,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night. Then I have to return to Republic City.
9050,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"I'm sorry, Korra. Your airbending training is going to have to wait."
9051,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"So, how long until you're ready to teach me airbending? A week? A month?"
9052,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,It could be much longer.
9053,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,I don't understand. Why are you making me wait?
9054,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"I have a responsibility to Republic City. I am one of its leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now."
9055,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"But you also have a responsibility to teach me. Believe me, I'd be happy to find another airbending master, but you're the only one. We're stuck with each other."
9056,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,I wish there were another way.
9057,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Wait, there is! If you can't stay here, then I'll go back to Republic City with you! It's perfect!"
9058,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,White Lotus leader,Absolutely not! The city is far too dangerous. Avatar Aang tasked us with keeping you safe while you mastered the four elements.
9059,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"I know this is difficult to accept, but it's not the right time for you to come to the city."
9060,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Whatever.
9061,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Ikki,"Goodbye, Gran Gran!"
9062,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"Oogi, yip-yip!"
9063,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,"Nice night for an escape, isn't it?"
9064,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,I know you do.
9065,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,Aang's time has passed. My brother and many of my friends are gone. It's time for you and your generation to take over the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world. And I think you're going to be a great Avatar.
9066,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Thank you.
9067,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Katara,"Goodbye, Korra."
9068,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Mom, Dad. I'll miss you."
9069,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Senna,We love you so much.
9070,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Thanks for the ride!
9071,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Wow, look at this place. I've never seen so many Satomobiles!"
9072,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Air Temple Island. That's where Tenzin lives. You ready for a little swim, girl? Okay, okay! Food first, then air temple!"
9073,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Watch out, Naga! Look out!"
9074,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Pedestrian,Watch where you're going!
9075,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Whoops, sorry about that. Excuse us. Coming through. Heads up. Eh, sorry, we're new in town."
9076,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Naga, wait. We'll take one of everything, please."
9077,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Shopkeeper,That will be twenty yuans.
9078,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Uh ... I don't have any money?
9079,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Shopkeeper,Then what good are you to me?
9080,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Don't worry, girl. The city's huge. I bet we could find a place to rustle up something to eat."
9081,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Gommu,"Uh, say, think I can I get one of them tasty-smelling fishies?"
9082,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Oh, uh, yeah, sure."
9083,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"So, do you ... live in that bush?"
9084,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Gommu,"Yes, presently that is what I do call home. Took me a while to procure a bush that beauteous. This park is quite popular with all the vagabonds."
9085,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Gommu,"Hey, you've got a lot to learn, newcomer. Welcome to Republic City."
9086,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Guard,"Hey, you! Stop! You can't fish here!"
9087,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Gommu,You best skedaddle!
9088,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Protester,"Are you tired of living under the tyranny of benders? Then join the Equalists! For too long, the bending elite of this city have forced nonbenders to live as lower class citizens. Join Amon, and together we will tear down the bending establishment."
9089,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,What are you talking about? Bending is the coolest thing in the world.
9090,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Protester,Oh yeah? Let me guess: you're a bender.
9091,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Yeah, I am."
9092,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Protester,"Then I bet you'd just ''love'' to knock me off this platform with some waterbending, huh?"
9093,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Protester,This is what's wrong with this city! Benders like this girl only use their power to oppress us!
9094,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Crowd,Yeah! Get out of here!
9095,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,What? I'm not oppressing anyone! You're ... you're oppressing yourselves!
9096,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Protester,That didn't even make sense.
9097,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Excuse me, I think I'm lost. How do I get to Air Temple Island from here?"
9098,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Old woman,Just head down this street.
9099,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Old woman,"You should get moving, young lady. It isn't safe."
9100,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Viper,"Mr. Chung, please tell me that you have my money, or else I can't guarantee I can protect your fine establishment."
9101,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Viper,"My friend here is not a music lover. Give me the money, or else -"
9102,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Or else what, hoodlum?"
9103,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"You're the only ones who are gonna need a hospital and, for your sake, I hope there's one nearby."
9104,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Viper,Who do you think you are?
9105,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Why don't you come and find out?
9106,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Old woman,What just happened?
9107,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Young man,Did she just earthbend?
9108,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Old woman,"Can she firebend, too?"
9109,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Young man,Could she be?
9110,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Got an idea about who I am ''now'', chumps?"
9111,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Mushi,Come on!
9112,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Metalbending cops,Police! Freeze where you are!
9113,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Cool! Metalbenders!
9114,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"I caught the bad guys for you, officers."
9115,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Saikhan,Arrest them!
9116,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Saikhan,"You're under arrest, too."
9117,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Saikhan,"From the looks of it, you smashed up a lot more than that."
9118,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Wait, you - you can't arrest me! Let me explain!"
9119,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Saikhan,"You can explain yourself all you like, down at headquarters."
9120,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Driver,Hey!
9121,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Lin,"Let's see. Multiple counts of destruction of private and city property, not to mention evading arrest ... You're in a whole mess of trouble, young lady."
9122,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"But there were some thugs threatening a helpless shopkeeper, and I had it ..."
9123,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"All right, fine. Then I want to talk to whoever's in charge."
9124,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Lin,You're talking to her. I'm Chief Beifong.
9125,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Wait, Beifong? Lin Beifong? You're Toph's daughter!"
9126,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Lin,What of it?
9127,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Well then, why are you treating me like a criminal? Avatar Aang and your mother were friends. They saved the world together."
9128,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Lin,That's ancient history. And it's got diddly-squat to do with the mess you're in right now. You can't just waltz in here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place!
9129,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Metalbending cop,"Chief, Councilman Tenzin is here."
9130,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Lin,"Cut the garbage, Tenzin. Why is the Avatar in Republic City? I thought you were supposed to be moving down to the South Pole to train her."
9131,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Tenzin, please, don't send me back home."
9132,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,You blatantly disobeyed my wishes and the orders of the White Lotus.
9133,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Katara agreed with me that I should come. She said my destiny is in Republic City.
9134,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,Don't bring my mother into this!
9135,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Look, I can't wait any longer to finish my training. Being cooped up and hidden away from the world isn't helping me become a better Avatar. I saw a lot of the city today, and it's totally out of whack. I understand now why you need to stay. Republic City does need you. But it needs me, too."
9136,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,You ... ah ...
9137,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Ruffled police officer,"Is this your polar bear dog, miss?"
9138,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Meelo and Ikki,Korra!
9139,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Tenzin,"Wait. I have done my best to guide Republic City toward the dream my father had for it, but you're right. It has fallen out of balance since he passed. I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy, but you ''are'' his legacy. You may stay and train airbending here with me. Republic City needs its Avatar once again."
9140,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,Yes! Thank you! You're the best!
9141,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"Hello? I'm Korra, your new Avatar."
9142,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Female journalist,Were you trying to send a message to the Triads yesterday?
9143,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Korra,"I'm so happy to be here. Thank you, Republic City!"
9144,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Lieutenant,"Amon, how do you want to handle this?"
9145,2,Welcome to Republic City,Air,1,62,Amon,"So, the Avatar has arrived early. It looks like we'll have to accelerate our plans."
9146,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,Earth. Fire. Air. Water. Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
9147,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"Republic City welcomes a new citizen into our arms. Avatar Korra! After years of seclusion in the South, this master of water, earth, and fire seeks to add airbending to her list of skills. And under the tutelage of Tenzin, Avatar Aang's son, she should go far. But will this cool, calm, collective master of air be able to tame this hotheaded teen?"
9148,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,That sport is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending.
9149,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus sentries around, to watch my every move?"
9150,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Yes. In order to learn airbending I believe you require a calm, quiet environment, free from any distractions."
9151,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"All right, you're the master."
9152,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"So, my mother informed me that you've never been able to airbend before."
9153,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"That's perfectly all right. You just need to be patient. Often the element that's the most difficult for the Avatar to master is the one most opposite to the Avatar's personality. For Aang, it was earthbending."
9154,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,Let's begin your first lesson.
9155,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Ikki,Korra's gonna airbend! Korra's gonna airbend!
9156,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,What is ''that'' contraption?
9157,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"A time-honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of airbending. Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise?"
9158,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,The key is to be like the leaf. Flow with the movement of the gates. Jinora will demonstrate.
9159,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Airbending is all about spiral movements. When you meet resistance, you must be able to switch direction at a moment's notice."
9160,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Ikki,Dance! Dance like the wind!
9161,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Meelo,Be the leaf!
9162,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Aargh! Maybe I'm just not cut out to be an airbender, huh, Naga?"
9163,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"This Mako's got moxy! He advances, fires two quick shots. Yomo is hammered back to zone three! Clock is winding down, can Yomo hold on? He's teetering on the edge of the ring now. The Fire Ferrets line up to strik-"
9164,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Korra, come down here please."
9165,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,You shut it off at the best part!
9166,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,I thought I made myself clear. I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.
9167,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"But it's their radio. And technically, you said I couldn't ''watch'' a match. You didn't say anything about listening to one."
9168,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,I think I'm doing it wrong.
9169,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Actually, I think he's asleep."
9170,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"I know you're frustrated, but these teachings will sink in over time. Then one day, they'll just click."
9171,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Yeah, it's not sinking in yet. I'm gonna go get a glass of lychee juice."
9172,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Korra, the meditation's not over yet!"
9173,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,No.
9174,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Toza,"Hey, what're you doin' in my gym?"
9175,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Uh, I was just looking for a bathroom and I got lost."
9176,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"No, wait!"
9177,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,"So, you see, we're together."
9178,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Well, not ''together'' together, more like friends."
9179,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Oh, you implied it."
9180,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Toza,"Ah, I don't care what you are! I got work to do."
9181,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,"Rrright this way, miss."
9182,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"And thank you, sir! Seriously, thanks."
9183,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,"Whaddya think? Best seats in the house, huh?"
9184,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Whoa! Unbelievable! This place is even more amazing than I imagined!
9185,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,"Name's Bolin, by the way."
9186,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Korra.
9187,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,"Psst, Bolin."
9188,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,Yeah?
9189,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,"Come on, Bolin, we're up."
9190,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Good luck. Knock 'em out!
9191,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Fangirl,"Aaaaaah! I love you, Bolin! Aaaaaah!"
9192,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"The rookie Ferrets came from out of nowhere and have made it further than anyone expected this season. But tonight, they face their toughest test yet, folks."
9193,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,And they're off! The two teams waste no time trying to blast each other out of zone one!
9194,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"Hasook is the first to feel the heat of the Tigerdillos! He tries to return the favor, but they're too fast for him, while Mako shows off his trademark ""cool under fire"" style!"
9195,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"Oooh, the Tigerdillos score with a walloping one-two combo!"
9196,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,Can their teammate hold on to their zone one territory? Guess not! Mako's over the line! The Tigerdillos get the green light and advance into Ferret territory!
9197,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Come on, Ferrets!"
9198,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,Assuming the fabulous bending brothers can hold their ground until the next round.
9199,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"The Fire Ferrets cinch the round in the closing seconds! It's one apiece, still anyone's match as we go into the third and final round!"
9200,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"It's a knockout! What a wing-dinger of a hat trick, folks! Mako pulls off the upset of the season, winning the match for the Fire Ferrets!"
9201,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,Barely!
9202,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,"Oh, you're still here?"
9203,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,Ooh!
9204,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Anyway, I've been immersed in bending my entire life, but I never learned how to move like that! It's like there's a whole new style here! Think you could show me a few tricks?"
9205,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,Ab-so-lutely!
9206,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Won't be a problem. I'm actually an earthbender.
9207,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Nope, you're right. I'm a waterbender. And a firebender."
9208,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,"You're the Avatar, and I'm an idiot."
9209,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Both are true.
9210,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,All right! Let's see what'cha got!
9211,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,"That was great! Good power! But in a real match, you'd be a sitting turtle duck. Not so upright and flatfooted! Stay light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then ... pop, pop!"
9212,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Okay, let me try it again."
9213,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,Wow! Nice adjustment! You're a natural at this.
9214,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,Not bad.
9215,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Upstairs? You guys live ''here''?
9216,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,"Yup. In the attic. It's nothin' fancy, but we have some great views! So, back to bending. Why don't you throw that combo one more time?"
9217,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Patience, Korra!"
9218,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Pema,"Dear, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space."
9219,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Jinora,I will make no such promises.
9220,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,Hasook's a no-good no-show!
9221,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Referee,"You got two minutes to come out ready to play, or you're disqualified."
9222,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,"Well, there goes our shot at the tournament ... and the winnings."
9223,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,Nah. The rules say you can only compete on one team.
9224,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Well, then ... how about me? I'm a top-notch waterbender, if I do say so myself."
9225,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,"But, you're the Avatar. Isn't that cheating?"
9226,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,It isn't cheating if I only do waterbending.
9227,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there.
9228,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence."
9229,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Referee,Time's up. You in or out?
9230,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,We're in!
9231,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,We are?
9232,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Bolin,Yes!
9233,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,You can thank me later.
9234,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,This girl is crazy.
9235,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,Looks like the Fire Ferrets have ferreted out a last minute replacement waterbender. Let's see if she's another diamond in the rough like the brothers from the school of hard knocks!
9236,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,"Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive. In fact, don't do anything. Just try not to get knocked off the ring."
9237,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"You got it, ''captain''."
9238,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Referee,Players! Are you ready?
9239,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Woohoo! Man overboard!
9240,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Referee,"Fire Ferret waterbender, penalty! Move back one zone!"
9241,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Oh. Whoops.
9242,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"And we're back in action after that hiccup, but I'm not so sure this replacement player knows what she's doing."
9243,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Referee,Foul! Over the line! Move back to zone three!
9244,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,Wait a minute! Did that waterbender just ''earthbend''?
9245,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"Did I see that right? Hold on, folks, we're just waiting for the referee's official call, but ... I-I think this replacement player could be ... no, there's no way!"
9246,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Pardon me, everyone, have you seen Korra this evening? She's not in her room."
9247,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,I'll get her myself!
9248,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Platypus Bears,Awww!
9249,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no pro-bender and the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness!"
9250,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"They're giving her their best, and her best ain't good enough to stop it!"
9251,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,Aaaaand she's in the drink.
9252,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"Oh, hey, Tenzin. I thought you didn't like coming to these matches."
9253,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Once again, you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders. You were to stay on the island! Let's go."
9254,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,No! I'm kind of in the middle of something.
9255,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,What? That is a ''ludicrous'' suggestion! The Avatar needs to learn airbending! It is ''not'' optional!
9256,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,No! ''This'' is what I need to learn! Modern styles of fighting!
9257,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra! When will you learn that?"
9258,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,I have a match to go finish.
9259,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Ring announcer,The Platypus Bears win round two! Round three!
9260,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"The Platypus Bears come out of the gate and quickly go after the Ferret brothers! They're corralled in the corner, wedged in the edge of zone one, unable to come to the Avatar's rescue! And boy, does she need it!"
9261,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"Looks like the Avatar's pro-bending debut is going to be cut short! She's been pushed back to zone three, and the water is calling her name!"
9262,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,It's only a matter of time before ...
9263,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"Hold the phone! Stop the presses! She's still in the game, folks! And she's moving like an entirely different player! All of a sudden, the Platypus Bears' strikes are only striking air!"
9264,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,How about that?
9265,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"The Platypus Bears have no juice left, but Mako and Bolin are still fresh and juicy!"
9266,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,Knockout!
9267,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,Woohoo!
9268,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Shiro Shinobi,"The Fire Ferrets come from ''waaay'' behind and steal the win! What an upset, folks! The rookies, Avatar in tow, have nabbed a place in the championship tournament! I can ''not'' believe it!"
9269,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra and Bolin,"Hahaha, yeah! Yes!"
9270,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Mako,Korra ... what can I say? You ''really'' came alive in that last round. The way you dodged their attacks ... you ''are'' a natural.
9271,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,"I'm really sorry ... about everything I said. I was really frustrated with myself, and I took it out on you."
9272,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"I think I owe you an apology too. I was trying to teach you about patience, but I lost mine."
9273,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,"Of course not. By the way, you were really good out there tonight. You moved ''just'' like an airbender!"
9274,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Korra,Wait ... You stayed and watched?
9275,2,A Leaf in the Wind,Air,1,63,Tenzin,I did. Pro-bending turned out to be the ''perfect'' teaching tool for you.
9276,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Shiro Shinobi,"A chance encounter turns Korra from pro-bending spectator to pro-bending star. With her new teammates, Mako and Bolin, the Fire Ferrets earn a place in the championship tournament. But meanwhile, an anti-bending revolution brews in Republic City. Who are the Equalists? And what nefarious plan does the mysterious man behind the mask have in store for our hero?"
9277,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning? The morning is ''evil''.
9278,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Bolin,"We're the rookies, so we get the worst time slot in the gym."
9279,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Butakha,"There are my little hard-working street urchins. It's an honor to finally meet you, Avatar."
9280,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,And you are ...?
9281,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Butakha,"Oh, and one more small item of business: The Fire Ferrets need to ante up thirty thousand yuans for the championship pot."
9282,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Bolin,"You wouldn't happen to have a secret Avatar bank account overflowing with gold, would you?"
9283,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,I got nothing. I've never really needed money. I've always had people taking care of me.
9284,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"So, ''anyway'', how are we gonna come up with the money?"
9285,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"Come on, Bolin. We need ''serious'' ideas."
9286,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Shady Shin,"Hey, Bolin. Is that you?"
9287,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Shady Shin,So listen. I got an offer for ya. Lightning Bolt Zolt is lookin' to hire some extra muscle.
9288,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Jinora,Good. Light on your feet!
9289,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"Ahem. Oh. Hey, Mako."
9290,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"Nice to see you, too. And no. I haven't seen him since practice. Think something's wrong?"
9291,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"Wait. I could, uh ... help you look for him."
9292,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,Nah. I got it.
9293,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,My best friend. ''And'' a great tracker.
9294,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"Your best friend is a ... polar bear dog. Somehow, that makes perfect sense."
9295,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"I'll take that as a compliment, city boy."
9296,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"Well, this is his usual hangout. You guys seen my brother around here today?"
9297,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Skoochy,"Perhaps. My memory's a little ...""foggy"". Maybe you can help ""clear it up""."
9298,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Skoochy,"Yeah, I seen him."
9299,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,When?
9300,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Skoochy,About noon.
9301,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,What was he doing?
9302,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Skoochy,H-he was performing some kind of monkey rat circus. And then ...
9303,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,And then what? Why did he leave?
9304,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Skoochy,Shady Shin showed up and flashed some ''serious'' cash. Bo took off with him in his hot rod. The Triple Threats? The Red Monsoons? The Agni Kais? All the triads are muscling up for something real big. Now that's all you're getting outta me!
9305,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,What's he talking about?
9306,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,So where're we headed?
9307,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,The Triple Threat Triad's headquarters. Hopefully Bolin's there and nothing's gone down yet.
9308,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"Whoa, Naga!"
9309,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,That's Pabu!
9310,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,We gotta hurry.
9311,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,Something's not right. There're usually thugs posted out front. We better be cautious.
9312,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,Bolin? You in here?
9313,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,Bolin!
9314,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"Naga, come!"
9315,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"Calm down, it'll wear off. Those guys were chi blockers. They're Amon's henchmen."
9316,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,Amon? That anti-bending guy with a mask?
9317,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists."
9318,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,What do they want with the Triple Threats?
9319,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,We've been out all night. No sign of him.
9320,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,Huh! I have an idea!
9321,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"The first day I got into town, I ran into an Equalist protester over there."
9322,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,And you think they'll know where Bolin is?
9323,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,It's our only lead right now.
9324,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,What? Wha- Are you some kind of criminal?
9325,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,Bolin's the only family I have left. If anything happened to him ...
9326,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"I-I ... er ... eheh, humn, hmmehem."
9327,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Protester,Nonbenders of Republic City ...
9328,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Protester,"Amon calls you to action! Take back your city! It's time for the ... It's you again! You cannot silence me, Avatar!"
9329,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"""Witness the Revelation tonight, nine o' clock"". What's this ""Revelation""?"
9330,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Protester,"No one knows what the Revelation is! And I have no idea what happened to your friend. But if he's a bender, then my bet is he's getting what's coming to him."
9331,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,Where's it happening?
9332,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Policeman,Hey! What's going on over there?
9333,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,Let's scram.
9334,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,Why didn't the Equalists put a location on these?
9335,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"So, it's a puzzle?"
9336,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,This is the place.
9337,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,What are you doing?
9338,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,We'll attract less attention this way.
9339,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,Uh ... invitation?
9340,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"I knew a lot of people hated benders, but I've never seen so many in one place. Keep your eyes out for Bolin."
9341,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Announcer,"Please welcome your hero, your savior ... Amon!"
9342,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,That's impossible. There's no way.
9343,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,This guy's insane!
9344,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,There's Bolin.
9345,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"Wait, we can't fight them all. We need to be smart about this."
9346,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Amon,"Zolt has amassed a fortune by extorting and abusing nonbenders. But his reign of terror is about to come to an end. Now, in the interest of fairness, I will give Zolt the chance to fight to keep his bending."
9347,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Shady Shin,No! Ugh!
9348,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"Works for me. Mako, good luck."
9349,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"You, too."
9350,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,It's not enough.
9351,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Doorman,"Hey, you!"
9352,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,Come on ...
9353,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,Thanks. This should be enough.
9354,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Mako,"Bolin, you all right?"
9355,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Bolin,Yes! Mako! I love you!
9356,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Lieutenant,"You benders need to understand, there's no place in the world for you anymore."
9357,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,"Yes, but ... I was at an Equalist rally. I saw Amon."
9358,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Korra,He can take people's bending away. For good.
9359,2,The Revelation (episode),Air,1,64,Tenzin,That's ... that's impossible. Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability.
9360,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Shiro Shinobi,"Benders be on alert. After coming face to face with Amon, leader of the Equalists, Avatar Korra discovers a terrifying truth: this masked mad man has the ability to take away a person's bending, permanently. Benders of Republic City are counting on their young Avatar. But is she prepared to face such a frightening foe?"
9361,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Amon,"After I take your bending away, you will be nothing."
9362,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"It's ... it's all right, Naga. I just had a bad dream."
9363,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"There is a madman running around our beloved city, threatening to tear it apart. We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find Amon and bring him to justice."
9364,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,Absolutely not. A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and nonbenders.
9365,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Fire Nation councilwoman,"Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal, but who would even head up such a task force?"
9366,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,It would be my honor and privilege to accept such a duty.
9367,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power, isn't it?"
9368,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, forty-two years ago, Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man. Yakone. Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head-on."
9369,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,This.. is a completely different situation ... and how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!
9370,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Amon is not going to stop with the bending triads. Eventually, he will come for all us benders. Our friends, our families. Vote for this task force and I will stop Amon before it's too late. All in favor?"
9371,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Amon,"Good evening, my fellow Equalists. This is your leader, Amon. As you have heard, the Republic Council has voted to make me public enemy number one, proving once again that the bending oppressors of this city will stop at nothing to quash our revolution. But we cannot be stopped. Our numbers grow stronger by the day. You no longer have to live in fear. The time has come for benders to experience fear."
9372,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,"Oh, no! I'm so sorry. I didn't see you."
9373,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,"Are you okay? Did I hurt you? Ugh, I'm such an idiot."
9374,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Don't worry, I'm fine. My brother hits me harder than that every day in practice."
9375,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,"Wait, I recognize you. You're Mako, right? You play for the Fire Ferrets."
9376,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Yeah, that's me."
9377,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,"I am ''so'' embarrassed. My name is Asami. Let me make this up to you somehow. Uh, how about I treat you to dinner? Tomorrow night, eight o' clock, Kwong's Cuisine."
9378,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Uh, Kwong's? I don't have any clothes nice enough for a place that classy."
9379,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,I'll take care of that. All you need to do is show up. So ... it's a date?
9380,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Uh, yeah, I guess so. I'll see you tomorrow night."
9381,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"We are grateful for this delicious food, for happiness, for compassion, and ..."
9382,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"I'm not interrupting, am I?"
9383,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"This is my home, Tarrlok. We're about to eat dinner."
9384,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Good, because I am absolutely famished. Airbenders never turn away a hungry guest, am I right?"
9385,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,I suppose.
9386,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Ah, you must be the famous Avatar Korra. It is truly an honor. I am Councilman Tarrlok, representative from the Northern Water Tribe."
9387,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Nice to meet you.
9388,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Ikki,Why do you have three ponytails? And how come you smell like a lady? You're weird.
9389,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Well aren't you ... precocious? So, I've been reading all about your adventures in the papers. Infiltrating Amon's rally, now that took some real initiative."
9390,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Oh, thanks. I think you're the first authority figure in the city who's happy I'm here."
9391,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,Republic City is much better off now that ''you've'' arrived.
9392,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Enough with the flattery, Tarrlok. What do you want from Korra?"
9393,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Patience, Tenzin. I'm getting to that. As you may have heard, I am assembling a task force that will strike at the heart of the revolution and I want you to join me."
9394,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Really?
9395,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"I need someone who will help me attack Amon directly, someone who is fearless in the face of danger. And that someone is you."
9396,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Join your task force? I can't.
9397,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"I must admit, I'm rather surprised. I thought you'd jump at the chance to help me lead the charge against Amon."
9398,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Me, too."
9399,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"I came to Republic City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin. Right now, I just need to focus on that."
9400,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,Which is why this opportunity is perfect. You would get on the job experience while performing your Avatar duty for the city.
9401,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,Korra gave you her answer. It's time for you to go.
9402,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Very well. But, I'm not giving up on you just yet. You'll be hearing from me soon. It has been a pleasure, Avatar Korra."
9403,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Ikki,"Bye-bye, ponytail man!"
9404,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Server,"Ah, welcome to Kwong's Cuisine, Master Mako."
9405,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Uh, ""Master""?"
9406,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,The scarf stays.
9407,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Server,"As you wish, sir. This way please."
9408,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,I am such a big pro-bending fan. I caught all of your matches this season.
9409,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"All of them? Wow. Honestly, I wish there were a few you hadn't seen."
9410,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,"Oh, don't be ridiculous, you're amazing. I can't wait to see you play in the tournament."
9411,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Yeah, well, ah, maybe next year."
9412,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,What do you mean? You made it in.
9413,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,It just isn't in the cards for us right now.
9414,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,Tell me. What's the problem?
9415,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"We don't have the cash to ante up for the championship pot. So, it looks like we're out of the running."
9416,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,That's not fair.
9417,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Ms. Sato? You wouldn't happen to be related to Hiroshi Sato, creator of the Satomobile?"
9418,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,Yeah. He's my dad.
9419,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,Get out of town!
9420,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,I'm serious. You want to meet him?
9421,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Meet the most successful captain of industry in all of Republic City? Yeah, I'll take you up on that."
9422,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,"Hello, fellow teammate!"
9423,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Hey, Bolin."
9424,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,Missed you at practice this week.
9425,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Yeah, sorry about that."
9426,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,"Nah, that's all right. We're probably out of the tournament anyways unless some money miraculously drops out of the sky by tomorrow. Anyways, the reason I came by was to give you this. Ta-da!"
9427,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Wow, thanks. What's this for?"
9428,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,"Uh, oh I can't remember now. Oh yeah, now I remember. You saved me from Amon!"
9429,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Oh, that? It was no big deal."
9430,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Mhmm.
9431,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Council page,Delivery for Avatar Korra. Tarrlok sends his compliments and urges you to reconsider his offer.
9432,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Tell him I haven't changed my mind.
9433,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Council page,Mhmm ...
9434,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,"Who's this Tarrlok guy? Is he bothering you? Huh, 'cause I could have a word with him."
9435,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Heh, no it's not like that. He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the council."
9436,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,"Oh, good. Good, that sounds better. I like that better."
9437,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Hiroshi Sato,What do you think of my little operation here?
9438,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"It's very impressive, Mr. Sato."
9439,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Hiroshi Sato,"Please, call me Hiroshi. So, I understand you're dirt poor."
9440,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Uh, well ..."
9441,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,"Dad, stop bragging. Just tell Mako the good news."
9442,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,What good news?
9443,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Hiroshi Sato,"Well, my daughter passionately told me all about your hard earned success in the Pro-bending Arena. And about your team's current financial stumbling block. Now, I'd hate to see you lose your chance at winning the championship just because you're short a few yuans. That's why I'm going to sponsor the Fire Ferrets in the tournament."
9444,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,Are you serious?
9445,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,He's serious. My dad's going to cover your ante for the championship pot.
9446,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,Tha-that ''is'' good news.
9447,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Hiroshi Sato,There's just one catch. You all have to wear the Future Industries logo on your uniforms.
9448,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"I'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, sir. Thank you both so much. I promise the Fire Ferrets will make the most of this opportunity."
9449,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Ikki,"Out of the way Daddy, we're driving here! Beeeeeeep beebeebeeeeep!"
9450,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Meelo,Beep-beep.
9451,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more and more extravagant.
9452,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Yeah, that guy doesn't know how to take ""no"" for an answer."
9453,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Korra, are you ... doing all right?"
9454,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Yeah, I'm fine."
9455,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Why don't you take a break? I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok, but I just want to make sure your decision was for the right reason."
9456,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,I'm just really focused on my airbending right now is all.
9457,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Right, that's what you said. You know, it's okay to be scared. The whole city is frightened by what's been going on. The important thing is to talk about our fears, because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance."
9458,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"I'm always here for you, if you want to talk."
9459,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Council page,Avatar Korra! I have something for you.
9460,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Council page,"It's not a gift, it's an invitation."
9461,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,To what?
9462,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Council page,Tarrlok is throwing a gala in your honor. All of Republic City's movers and shakers will be there. The councilman humbly requests your attendance.
9463,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,I can't believe this is all for me.
9464,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting, but keep your guard up. It's not like him to throw a party just for the fun of it."
9465,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"So glad you could make it, Avatar Korra. If you'd excuse us, the city awaits its hero."
9466,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Meelo! No, that's not a toilet! Oh dear."
9467,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Korra, it's my pleasure to introduce Republic City's most famous industrialist, Hiroshi Sato."
9468,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Nice to meet you.
9469,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Hiroshi Sato,We're all expecting great things from you.
9470,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Right, greatness."
9471,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Hey, Korra!"
9472,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Hiroshi Sato,"This is my daughter, Asami."
9473,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,It's lovely to meet you. Mako's told me so much about you.
9474,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Really? Because he hasn't mentioned you at all. How did you two meet?
9475,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,Asami crashed into him on her moped.
9476,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,What? Are you okay?
9477,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,"Hehe, isn't that great?"
9478,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Yeah, terrific."
9479,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Chief Beifong, I believe you and Avatar Korra have already met."
9480,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Lin Beifong,"Just because the city's throwing you this big to-do, don't think you're something special. You've done absolutely nothing to deserve this."
9481,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"If you'd be so kind, they just have a couple of questions."
9482,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,But ...
9483,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,I think he presents a real problem.
9484,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Well, I ..."
9485,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,What? No! I've never backed away from anything in my life!
9486,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,I am not ''afraid'' of anybody! If the city needs me then ... I'll join Tarrlok's task force and help fight Amon.
9487,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"There's your headline, folks."
9488,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"My fellow task force deputies, tonight we will execute a raid on an underground chi blocker training camp located in the Dragon Flats borough. According to my sources, there is a cellar underneath this bookstore, where Equalists train chi blocking in secret."
9489,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,I'm going after those two.
9490,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Nice timing. Thanks, Tarrlok."
9491,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"We make a good team, Avatar."
9492,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Yeah, we do."
9493,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Bolin,No Korra for practice again?
9494,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,Doesn't look like it.
9495,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"Avatar Korra has bravely answered the call to action. With the two of us leading the charge, Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists."
9496,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Female reporter,Question for the Avatar! Amon remains at large. Why have you failed to locate him?
9497,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"You want to know why? Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward. Amon, I challenge you to a duel! No task force, no chi blockers, just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island. Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing, ''if'' you're man enough to face me."
9498,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,"I know it sounds weird to say this, but I'm really glad I hit you with my moped."
9499,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"Uh, me too."
9500,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,I forgot to ask. Why didn't you accept the new silk scarf I bought for you last week? You didn't like it?
9501,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Mako,"No, it was really nice, but this scarf was my father's. And it's all I have left of him. I just feel like ... Like it keeps me safe."
9502,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,I'm so sorry. I lost my mother when I was very young.
9503,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Asami,I feel so safe with you.
9504,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Korra, this is madness."
9505,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Don't try to stop me and don't follow me. I have to face Amon alone.
9506,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,This is all your doing!
9507,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"I tried to talk her out of it too, but she's made up her mind."
9508,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tarrlok,"We'll be watching the island closely. If anything goes wrong, I have a fleet of police airships ready to swoop down."
9509,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Guess you're a no-show, Amon. Who's scared now?"
9510,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Amon,"I received your invitation, young Avatar."
9511,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Amon,"Our showdown, while inevitable, is premature. Although it would be the simplest thing for me to take away your bending right now, I won't. You'd only become a martyr. Benders of every nation would rally behind your untimely demise, but I assure you, I have a plan. And I'm saving you for last, then you'll get your duel, and I ''will'' destroy you."
9512,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,Aang?
9513,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Korra! Korra, are you all right? What happened? Was Amon here?"
9514,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"Yeah, he ambushed me."
9515,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,Did he ... did he take your bending away?
9516,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"No, I'm okay."
9517,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"Ah, thank goodness."
9518,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"I was so terrified, I felt so helpless."
9519,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,"It's all right, the nightmare is over."
9520,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Korra,"You ... you were right ... I've been scared this whole time. I've never felt like this before and ... and Tenzin, I don't know what to do!"
9521,2,The Voice in the Night,Air,1,65,Tenzin,Admitting your fears is the first and most difficult step in overcoming them.
9522,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,Love is in the air! Since Avatar Korra has arrived in Republic City she's only had eyes for one fellow: Mako. The feeling seemed mutual until a fateful accident intervened. Now Mako's affections have fallen right into the arms of the beautiful Asami. Will love prove to be Korra's most formidable foe yet?
9523,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"It's been great having you at so many back-to-back practices, Korra."
9524,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Hey, you joined the Fire Ferrets ''before'' you joined his task force."
9525,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Okay, come on, team huddle time!"
9526,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"It's our first match of the tournament tonight. I know the three of us haven't been a team for very long, but even so, the Fire Ferrets have never been this good. Are we ready?"
9527,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra and Bolin,We're ready!
9528,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Asami,"Not quite, you'll need these."
9529,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Hey, Asami."
9530,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Asami,"Good morning, sweetie."
9531,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,These new uniforms look great!
9532,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Asami,"''You'' look great, champ!"
9533,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Well, teammates, I'll see you before the match tonight. Asami and I have a lunch date."
9534,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Okay, we'll check you guys later, you know, we'll see you when we see ya."
9535,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"So, Korra. There they go, here we are, all alone in the gym, just you and me, two ''alone'' people. Together. Alone."
9536,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Ah, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin. See ya!"
9537,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Work with me here, Pabu! You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you? So, what do you think of Korra, in a ""girlfriend"" sort of way?"
9538,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,She's great! But I think it makes more sense for me to go for Asami.
9539,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,I was talking about a girlfriend for me! Leave some ladies for the rest of us!
9540,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"I know, that's what I thought you meant."
9541,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,Well ...?
9542,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"I don't know, Bo. It doesn't seem like a good idea for you to date Korra."
9543,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,You just said she was great two seconds ago.
9544,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Yeah, Korra is a great athlete and the Avatar and stuff, but I don't know if she's really ""girlfriend material"". She's more like a pal."
9545,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Look, it just isn't smart to date a teammate, ''especially'' during the tournament. Keep your head out of the clouds and your priorities straight, okay?"
9546,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Yeah, yeah, I know, gah. You know what I'm talking about, Pabu, I'm talking about ''real love''."
9547,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Jinora,"So, how's it going with the tall, dreamy firebender boy? You've been spending ''a lot'' of time together lately."
9548,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ikki,"Oooh, yeah! Tell us all about the ''magical'' romance."
9549,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"What? Listen to you two, I-I'm not interested in Mako or ''any ''romantic stuff. Besides he's all into that prissy, beautiful, elegant, rich girl ... but let's just pretend for a second I ''am'' interested in him. What would I do?"
9550,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Jinora,"Ooh! I just read a historical saga where the heroine fell in love with the enemy general's son, who's supposed to marry the princess. You should do what she did!"
9551,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,Tell me!
9552,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Jinora,She rode a dragon into battle and burned down the ''entire country''. Then she jumped into a volcano. It was ''so'' romantic!
9553,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,Uhh ...
9554,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ikki,"No, no, no! The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that makes true lovers sprout wings and fly into a magical castle in the sky, where they get married and eat clouds with spoons and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch. Forever and ever and ever!"
9555,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now.
9556,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Oh, hey Pema. Uh, how long were you standing there?"
9557,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Pema,"Long enough. But trust me, I know what you're going through. Years ago I was in the exact the same situation, with Tenzin."
9558,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ikki,Daddy was in love with someone else before you?
9559,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Pema,That's right.
9560,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,So what did you do?
9561,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Pema,"Well, for the longest time, I did nothing. I was so shy and scared of rejection, but watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful. So I hung my chin out there and I ''confessed'' my love to Tenzin. And the rest is history."
9562,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"Folks, after a year of waiting the Pro-bending Championship is finally here. Tonight is the first set of matches in our single elimination sixteen team bracket. And I gotta tell ya, these are the most tenacious and talented bending trios this arena has ever seen."
9563,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,"Introducing our first team, the Future Industries Fire Ferrets! And their opponents, the Red Sands Rabaroos!"
9564,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"What an explosive opening volley. Both teams quickly recover and unleash a barrage of bending. I am astonished with the level of improvement displayed here by the Fire Ferrets. No wonder the Avatar has been absent from the papers lately. She's obviously had her nose to the grindstone in the gym. The Ferrets advance into Rabaroo territory and are holding nothing back. Nice sprawl there by Mako. Bolin strikes, Ula dodges, and all three Rabaroos are down. The Fire Ferrets easily take round one!"
9565,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,Round two!
9566,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,The Rabaroos are looking for payback and they go straight after Bolin. Korra comes to his defense and water-whacks Umi back into zone two! The Ferrets are on fire tonight and they win round two.
9567,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,Round three!
9568,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"With the Rabaroos down two rounds they'll need a knockout to win, and with the way the Fire Ferrets are playing I don't see that happening. These Ferrets are working together like a well-oiled bending machine. Bolin passes Adi back into zone two and the Ferrets get the green light to advance. The Rabaroos are just fighting to stay at their feet at this point. Out goes Adi, and Ula, and Umi!"
9569,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,All three rounds go to the Future Industries Fire Ferrets to win the opening match of the tournament!
9570,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"That's what I'm talking about! Thank you, thank you very much! Thank you all you fans!"
9571,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Wow, we were really connecting out there in that ring."
9572,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Yeah! You know, I feel like the two of us have been connecting really well ''out'' of the ring, too."
9573,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Uh, sure."
9574,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"So, I was thinking we should spend some time together."
9575,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Oh, we've been spending lots of time together."
9576,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"I mean outside of the gym, and not while searching for kidnapped family members or fighting chi blockers."
9577,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Look, I really like you and I think we are meant for each other!"
9578,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Korra, I'm really sorry, but I just don't feel the same way about you."
9579,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,Forget I ever said anything ...
9580,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Asami,"Congratulations, guys! You were so amazing out there."
9581,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"So, Korra, I was thinking, you and me, we could get some dinner together, sort of a ''date'' situation."
9582,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Oh, that's really sweet, but I don't think so. I don't feel very ''date''-worthy."
9583,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Are you kidding me? You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!"
9584,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,You really feel that way about me?
9585,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"I felt that way since the moment I saw you! Trust me, I know we're gonna have so much fun together."
9586,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"You know what? I could use some fun. Okay, sure!"
9587,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Yes! Who's the luckiest guy in the world? Right here, Bolin!"
9588,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"So, how do you like it?"
9589,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Hmm, it's delicious and'' totally ''authentic! I didn't realize how much I missed Water Tribe grub."
9590,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"That's great, 'cause this is my favorite joint. See? You love Water Tribe food, I love Water Tribe food, just another reason we are so great together."
9591,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"They are good noodles! Hey, who's that creepy guy over there who keeps glaring at us?"
9592,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"That's Tahno and the Wolfbats, the reigning champs, three years running. Don't make eye contact."
9593,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Uh-oh, here he comes. Now don't mess with this guy, he's a nasty dude."
9594,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Tahno,"Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets. Pro-bending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how did a couple of amateurs like you luck your way into the tournament? Especially you, Uh-vatar. You know, if you'd like to learn how a ''real'' pro bends, I could give you some ''private'' lessons."
9595,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"You wanna go toe-to-toe with me, pretty boy?"
9596,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Tahno,Go for it. I'll give you the first shot.
9597,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Korra, don't. He's just trying to bait you. If you hit him, we're out of the tournament."
9598,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Whoa, ho, ho, I've never seen someone harass Tahno like that. ''You'' are one of a kind, Korra."
9599,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,What kind of game are you playing?
9600,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,Uh ... Pro-bending? We've got the quarterfinal match.
9601,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"No, I mean with Bolin. You've got him all in a tizzy and I know you're only using him to get back at me."
9602,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"I am not, we're just having fun together. What do you care, anyway?"
9603,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,I'm looking out for my little brother. I don't want to see his heart get broken.
9604,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Wait a second ... you're not worried about him, you're jealous! You ''do'' have feelings for me!"
9605,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,What? Jealous? Don't be ridiculous.
9606,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,Admit it! You like me.
9607,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"No, I'm with Asami."
9608,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Yeah, but when you're with her you're thinking about me, aren't you?"
9609,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Get over yourself!
9610,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,I'm just being honest.
9611,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,You're crazy!
9612,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,You're a liar!
9613,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Random stranger,Hey Mako-! Oh ...
9614,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"Eight teams have been eliminated and eight advance into the quarter finals, which get underway way tonight. The rookies are about to take on the former and longest-reigning champs, the Boar-q-pines. Youth clashes against experience in a battle for the ages, or rather ''of'' the ages. Korra dodges and, ''ooh'', slams right into her teammate! Down goes Mako and Bolin and Korra!"
9615,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,Round one goes to the Boar-q-pines!
9616,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,You were supposed to defend while I attacked!
9617,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,I had an opening so I took it!
9618,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"What is up with you two? All right, whatever, just pull together, guys."
9619,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"The Ferrets looking to mount some offense here in round two. Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks, he's a one-man bending battalion. The Ferrets are having a rough time finding their rhythm tonight, but thanks to Bolin, they narrowly notch round two. Not sure what's eating them, but this is not the same team who took out the Rabaroos."
9620,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,Round three is a tie! We go to a tie-breaker to decide the match.
9621,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Referee,The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss! Which element do you choose?
9622,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,I got this.
9623,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"I know you usually handle these, but frankly, your head's not in the game. I'm gonna take this one. We choose earth."
9624,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"Looks like the earthbenders will collide in the tie-breaker face-off. Bolin goes in for the grapple, Chang reverses. Bolin strikes from midair, knocking Chang to the edge of the circle. Another strike from Bolin, and Chang is in the drink!"
9625,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,The Future Industries Fire Ferrets win their quarterfinal match!
9626,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"Oh, that was a close one folks! Youth trumps experience tonight."
9627,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me.
9628,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is: as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing."
9629,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,So you ''do'' like me?
9630,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Bolin, this isn't what you think! Great, look at what you did!"
9631,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,You're blaming me?
9632,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,''You'' kissed me!
9633,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,''You'' kissed me back!
9634,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Well played, Korra."
9635,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Morning, Narook. My brother here? Thanks. Come on. Wake up. Taking you home, bro."
9636,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,Don't call me that. You're not my brother! You're a brother betrayer! The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu! Pabu loves me.
9637,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"You're a mess, and we've got the biggest match of our lives tonight. Let's go."
9638,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"No! I'm not going anywhere with you, you traitor!"
9639,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Guess we'll have to do this the hard way.
9640,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,Why?
9641,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Told you dating a teammate was a bad idea.
9642,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,''You're'' a bad idea! Put me down! Put me down!
9643,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"You can't find two teams more evenly matched in age, size, and strength than the Fire Ferrets and the Buzzard Wasps. Believe me, I've looked! This should be a pulse-pounding semifinal, folks! The Buzzard Wasps open with a flawlessly executed combo. All three Ferrets take an early visit to zone two. And Mako is knocked all the way back into zone three! The Fire Ferrets have been struggling to stay alive since the opening bell. All three players are totally out of sync tonight. Ooh, that has got to sting! And Bolin loses his noodles! Literally. Which reminds me, this match is brought to you by our sponsor, Flameo Instant Noodles! Noodliest noodles in the United Republic. The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper into Ferret territory. And Mako plunges into the pool! Can the Fire Ferrets hold on? The Wasps have the Ferrets backed up to the edge now ... and the Ferrets are bailed out by the bell! They had better pull themselves together for round two, otherwise they can kiss the finals goodbye."
9644,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,Hey! Watch it!
9645,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"The Wasps take advantage of Mako's unforced error and Bolin is in the pool! Ooh, and a blatant hold by the Avatar!"
9646,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Referee,Unnecessary roughness! Move back one zone!
9647,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,I'll unnecessarily rough you up!
9648,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"And the Avatar is slapped with the yellow fan. The Ferrets are their own worst enemy right now. It's just sad to watch. With the Buzzard Wasps leading two rounds to zilch, the Ferrets' only hope of winning is with a knockout."
9649,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,"Well, I guess there's always next year."
9650,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Come on! We still have a chance, even if it is a slim one!"
9651,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"The way we're playing, we don't even deserve to be in the finals."
9652,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Look, if we don't pull together and work as a team, we'll never forgive ourselves."
9653,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Let's just get this over with.
9654,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"The sooner, the better."
9655,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"Bolin's knocked into zone two, followed quickly by his brother! And Bolin takes a zinger to the shoulder! Looks like it's a clean hit."
9656,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,Owww!
9657,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Bolin!
9658,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"Mako's in the drink and out of the match. And Bolin keeps playing with one good arm! I gotta hand it to him, this kid's got grit! But how long can he keep it up? Apparently, not very long. The Ferrets' dream of making it to the finals now rests in the Avatar's hands. But with three on one, I don't like her odds."
9659,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Are you okay? How's your shoulder?
9660,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Ahh, it's messed up pretty bad. But I think I'll be all right. Are ''we'' gonna be all right?"
9661,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Of course we are. We're brothers. We'll get through this mess. I'm sorry.
9662,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,Me too! Girls ...
9663,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Seriously.
9664,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"What an unbelievable effort here by Korra! She's dodging every element the Wasps throw at her! The Avatar finally gains some ground, but with only ten seconds remaining, it might be too little too late! It's the big kibosh! What a knockout!"
9665,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,Yes! She did it!
9666,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Yes! Yeah!
9667,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"It didn't seem possible, folks, but the Fire Ferrets are headed to the finals!"
9668,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Ha, ha! Shoulder! Shoulder!"
9669,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Sorry.
9670,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"That, was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen."
9671,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Thanks for not giving up on us. We never would have made it this far without you. I owe you. Big time.
9672,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"You're welcome. So ... I know things are confusing right now, but I hope we can still be friends."
9673,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Mako,Definitely.
9674,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,I hope we see you in the finals. Then we'll know who the losers ''really'' are.
9675,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Tahno,"Yeah, I'm peeing my pants over here."
9676,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,"And now, the defending champs, the White Falls Wolfbats!"
9677,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Asami,"Great job! What a comeback, Korra. I've never seen a hat trick like that."
9678,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Thanks! But, if it hadn't been for you and your father, we wouldn't have had the chance to play. So thank you."
9679,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Uh, if everyone's done with the little ""thank you"" party, need some medical attention over here."
9680,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Ooh, let me help!"
9681,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Owww! Gah! Haven't you hurt me enough, woman?"
9682,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Relax, I'm a healer! I learned from Katara, the best there is."
9683,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"No, no, oh- ooh! That's the stuff!"
9684,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand."
9685,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Ahh, I'll be all right. But we had fun together, didn't we?"
9686,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,"I had a great time, honestly! You are one of a kind, Bolin."
9687,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Bolin,"Please, go on. I enjoy praise."
9688,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Ring announcer,"Your winners, the Wolfbats!"
9689,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Korra,What? How is it over already?
9690,2,The Spirit of Competition,Air,1,66,Shiro Shinobi,"With a brutal round one knockout, the defending champs secure their spot in the finals. I hope the Ferrets know a good doctor, 'cause they're gonna need one!"
9691,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,"After a close encounter with Amon, Korra took a leave of absence from Tarrlok's task force. But the Avatar has still been hard at work, leading the underdog Fire Ferrets to the pro-bending championship finals. Only one team stands in their way: the Wolfbats! Led by team captain Tahno, the brutal Wolfbats look to repeat as champs. Have the Fire Ferrets finally met their match?"
9692,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Radio host,"You're listening to ""The Music Hour""! Brought to you by Cabbage Corp, Republic City's trusted name in technology for over fifty years."
9693,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"Man, I got a good feeling about tonight. I don't care if we are the underdogs. We can take those pompous Wolfbats."
9694,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,"It's going to be our toughest match ever, but I think you're right."
9695,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,"Introducing your new champs, the fantastic Fire Ferrets!"
9696,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Amon,"Good morning, citizens of Republic City. This is Amon. I hope you all enjoyed last night's pro-bending match, because it will be the last. It's time for this city to stop worshiping bending athletes as if they were heroes. I am calling on the council to shut down the bending arena and cancel the finals, or else there will be severe consequences."
9697,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,That guy's got some nerve.
9698,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,You think the council will give in?
9699,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,I'm not waiting to find out. We need to get to City Hall.
9700,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"As the Avatar and a pro-bending player, I have a right to be heard. You can't cancel the finals."
9701,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"I know winning the championship means a lot to you. But as far as I'm concerned, we need to shut the arena down."
9702,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"What about the rest of you? Tarrlok, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right?"
9703,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,"Actually, Tenzin and I agree for once."
9704,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,The council is unanimous. We're closing the arena.
9705,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,No!
9706,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,You can't!
9707,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"I-I don't understand. I thought you, of all people, would take a stand against Amon."
9708,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,"While I am still committed to bringing that lunatic to justice, I will ''not'' put innocent lives at stake just so you and your friends can play a game."
9709,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,"Pro-bending might only be a game to you, but think of what it means to the city! Right now the arena is the one place where benders and nonbenders gather together ... in-in peace! To watch benders ..."
9710,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,Beat each other up! In peace! It's an inspiration to everyone!
9711,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,"I appreciate your naive idealism, but you're ignoring the reality of the situation."
9712,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"The reality is if you close the arena, you let Amon win!"
9713,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,"Yes, exactly what she said! Yes!"
9714,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,"I'm sorry, but our decision has been made. This meeting is adjourned."
9715,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with the Avatar."
9716,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,You do?
9717,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"Yeah, you do?"
9718,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,"I expected this kind of cut-and-run response from Tenzin. But the rest of you? Come on, show a little more backbone. It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists."
9719,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"We must prevent the conflict between benders and nonbenders from escalating into all-out war! The council is not changing its position, Lin."
9720,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,"Now just a moment, Tenzin. Let us hear what our esteemed Chief of Police has in mind."
9721,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,"If you keep the arena open, my metalbenders and I will provide extra security during the championship match. There's no better force to deal with the chi blockers. Our armor is impervious to their attacks."
9722,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,Are you saying that you will ''personally'' take responsibility for the safety of the spectators in the arena?
9723,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,I guarantee it.
9724,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,"It is hard to argue with Chief Beifong's track record. If she is confident her elite officers can protect the arena, then she has my support. I am changing my vote. Who else is with me? The arena stays open. Good luck in the finals."
9725,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,All right!
9726,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,Yeah!
9727,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,Thank you!
9728,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tarrlok,"And good luck to you, Chief Beifong."
9729,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"A word please, Lin."
9730,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want to see you get hurt.
9731,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,I know what I am doing and the risks that come with it.
9732,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"In that case, I'm going to be by your side during the match."
9733,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,You don't need to babysit me.
9734,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,It's for Korra. I want to make sure she's safe.
9735,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,Do what you want! It's not like I've ever been able to stop you before.
9736,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"Excuse me, Chief Beifong. I wanted to thank you for your help, it ... really ... means a lot ... What is her deal? Even when she's on my side, she's against me!"
9737,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"I've known Lin since we were children, she's always been ... challenging."
9738,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,What did your father do to make her hate the Avatar so much?
9739,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,My father and Lin got along famously. I'm afraid her issues ... are with me.
9740,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"Wait a second ... it all makes sense now! You and Beifong, Beifong and you. You two were a couple!"
9741,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,What! How-? Where'd you get that idea?
9742,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,Ha! Your wife.
9743,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,Criminy! I'll have to have a word with her.
9744,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"So ... Pema stole you from Beifong. I'm surprised our ""esteemed Chief of Police"" didn't throw her in jail."
9745,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"Oh, she tried. Anyway, Pema didn't ''steal'' me, Lin and I had been growing apart for some time. We both had different goals in li- Why am I even telling you this? It all happened a long time ago and we've moved passed it."
9746,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"Hm, apparently Beifong hasn't."
9747,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"What do you ... Of course she has! Anyway, this is none of your business!"
9748,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker!"
9749,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lieutenant,I just got word. The council defied your threat. They're keeping the arena open.
9750,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Amon,Perfect. Everything is going according to plan.
9751,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Officer,"All clear, Chief."
9752,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,How is the security sweep going?
9753,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,Fine.
9754,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,They've checked underneath the stands?
9755,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,Yes.
9756,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,And you have enough officers to cover all points of entry?
9757,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,"I have the skies, the bay, and every nook and cranny of this place covered. Now leave me alone and let me do my job."
9758,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"Lin, with so much on the line it would be nice if we could help each other out, at least for one night."
9759,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,Like old times?
9760,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,Like old times.
9761,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,"Okay, I'll try to be less abrasive than usual."
9762,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,I would appreciate that.
9763,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,The anticipation is palpable as we are just moments away from the championship match. Will the Wolfbats' ferocity help them repeat as champs? Or will the underdog Fire Ferrets serve up a surprising bowl of smackdown soup?
9764,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,"Now I know there's a big crowd but don't be nervous. You're gonna do great, I believe in you."
9765,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Ring announcer,"Introducing the challengers, the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!"
9766,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,"You're on, Pabu."
9767,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,Yes! Nailed it! He's so talented!
9768,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Ring announcer,"And their opponents, the three timed defending champions, the White Falls Wolfbats!"
9769,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,"Pfft, they got nothing on us, buddy. Anybody can howl. Hm, whatever."
9770,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,I'm gonna knock Tahno's ''stupid'' hair off his ''stupid'' head!
9771,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,The champs and challengers face off at the center-line and here we go!
9772,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,"Tahno tries to clean the Avatar's clock with some dirty water boxing. Ming shakes off Mako's attack and returns the favor. Shaozu gets fancy, but Bolin ricochets a disk off the ropes and says 'No, thank you sir!'"
9773,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,Nice shot!
9774,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,"The waterbenders slug it out, looking evenly matched. Tahno gets a little too worked up and unleashes a deluge on Bolin that would certainly elicit a foul. Or apparently not."
9775,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,"What's the big idea, ref? That was a hosing foul!"
9776,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,And the Wolfbats advance despite Tahno exceeding the waterbending time limit. A questionable call by the officials. Ming trips up Mako with another dirty trick!
9777,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"Oh come on, refs! There was some funny business in that last play!"
9778,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,Wouldn't have guessed you knew the rules of pro-bending?
9779,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,I've been brushing up. That Wolfbat blatantly bent a disk outside of his zone.
9780,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,"The Ferret brothers are backed up to zone three and the Wolfbats smell blood. Looks like Tahno snuck in an illegal icing move but once again there's no call. I don't know what match the refs are watching but it's obviously not this one. Oh ... a splash-and-clash sends the Avatar to zone three as well. It's a knockout! The Wolfbats win the championship for the fourth year in a- Hold on a second, folks! Scratch that! The Ferrets are still alive, but just barely. What an unbelievable move! These Ferrets aren't just bending the elements, they're bending my mind! The underdogs survive to see round two."
9781,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,What's wrong with these refs?
9782,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"If the Wolfbats are gonna fight dirty, then so should we."
9783,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,"No we can't! The refs have it out for us. If we're gonna win this thing, it has to be fair and square."
9784,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"Argh, that's no fun but ... all right."
9785,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Ring announcer,Round two!
9786,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,"The opening salvo is a brutal call as both sides give it their all. But once again, Tahno sneaks in a little ice to get the upper hand. Wowzers! Those look like illegal head shots to me!"
9787,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Ring announcer,Round two will be decided with a tie-breaker!
9788,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Referee,The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss. Which element do you choose?
9789,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tahno,Thought you'd never ask.
9790,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tahno,"Come on, little girl. Give me your best shot."
9791,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"Hmph, chump."
9792,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Ring announcer,Round two goes to the Fire Ferrets!
9793,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,Nice one!
9794,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,That's the stuff. You are my herooo-ah!
9795,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,We might actually win this thing!
9796,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tahno,Let's send them to a watery grave!
9797,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,I can't believe your sweet-tempered father was reincarnated into that girl. She's tough as nails.
9798,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,Reminds me of someone else I knew at that age. You two might get along if you would only give her a chance.
9799,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,Hmph.
9800,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,"One round apiece: who wants it more? The Wolfbats fly out of the gates, swinging with bad intentions. The challengers are showing a lot of heart but the champs are really starting to find their rhythm now. Can the Ferrets hang in there with the best, especially when the best are ''frankly'' getting a little help from the refs? It's all down to this final round! Mako is leaving it all in the ring but it looks like Tahno and Ming are up to more shenanigans! Oh, this has gone too far! That water had rocks in it!"
9801,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Referee,Knockout!
9802,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,"Oh, come on! Those were illegal head shots! Open your eyes, ref!"
9803,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,"Well, folks it's a controversial call but the Wolfbats notch a nasty knockout to win the match! For the fourth year in a row, they'll be crowned tournament champions."
9804,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tahno,I barely broke a sweat! Anybody else wanna scrap with the champs?
9805,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,Look out!
9806,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,What?
9807,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Shiro Shinobi,"Folks, there is some sort of electrical disturbance in the stands. Metalbender cops are dropping like bumbleflies. There appear to be masked members of the audience wielding strange devices on their hands. One of them is in the booth with me right now, folks! He is leveling one of those glove devices at me now and I believe he is about to electrocute me. I am currently wetting my pants."
9808,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tahno,"What's going on here, ref?"
9809,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Referee,I don't know!
9810,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tahno,"All right, you want a piece of the Wolfbats? Here it comes!"
9811,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tahno,"Wait, please don't do this! I'll give you the championship pot, I'll-I'll give you everything just please don't take my bending!"
9812,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Amon,"I believe I have your attention, benders of Republic City. So once again, the Wolfbats are your pro-bending champions. It seems fitting that you celebrate three bullies who cheated their way to victory because every day, you threaten and abuse your fellow nonbending citizens just like the Wolfbats did to their opponents tonight. Those men were supposedly the best in the bending world and yet it only took a few moments for me to cleanse them of their impurity. Let this be a warning to all of you benders out there: if any of you stand in my way, you will meet the same fate. Now, to my followers: for years the Equalists have been forced to hide in the shadows, but now we have the numbers and the strength to create a new Republic City. I'm happy to tell you that the time for change has finally come. Very soon, the current tyrannical bending regime will be replaced by a fair-minded Equalist government. You and your children will no longer have to walk the streets afraid! It's time to take back our city."
9813,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,How are we gonna get out of here?
9814,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,"Pabu! Listen up, buddy."
9815,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,Stop fooling around!
9816,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,I'm not! I'm trying to save us! See? Pabu's not just a one trick poodle pony.
9817,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Amon,"For centuries, benders have possessed an unnatural advantage over ordinary people. But thankfully, modern technology has provided us with a way to even out the playing field. Now anyone can hold the power of a chi blocker in their hand. My followers and I will not rest until the entire city achieves equality, and once that goal is achieved, we will equalize the rest of the world. The revolution has begun!"
9818,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,Tenzin!
9819,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,"It's okay, Pabu. Just a little explosion. Keep chewing, you're almost through it! Yes! Great job, buddy!"
9820,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,I'm going after Amon!
9821,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Mako,Be careful!
9822,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,You all right?
9823,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Korra,"I'm fine, thanks to you."
9824,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,"Don't mention it, kid. Looks like we lost this one."
9825,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Bolin,Me too!
9826,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Lin,I can't believe Amon did this. I played right into his hand.
9827,2,And the Winner Is...,Air,1,67,Tenzin,He played us all. Republic City is at war.
9828,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tarrlok,"Although the Hundred Year War has long passed, we are not living in a time of peace. These revolutionaries who call themselves ""Equalists"" are not interested in equality at all. They just want to wage war against benders. Chief Beifong was supposed to protect Republic City, but she was powerless to stop Amon's attack on the arena. She has failed us all. If we are to survive these dire times, our law enforcement needs new leadership."
9829,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,I still can't believe they're shutting this place down.
9830,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,"Yeah. We had some good memories here, didn't we?"
9831,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Guys! Great news. You don't have to go back on the streets. I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements. You can come live on Air Temple Island with me!
9832,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"Oh, we'd love to, but ..."
9833,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"Oh hey, Korra, I was hoping you would stop by."
9834,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"I was just leaving. So, I guess I'll see you guys around, some time."
9835,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,Why not tomorrow? I'd love to have you come visit the estate.
9836,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,I don't know. I have some ... Avatar stuff to do.
9837,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"All right, Pabu."
9838,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"Great, we'll see you tomorrow."
9839,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,Looks like our intel was good.
9840,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Saikhan,There's enough evidence here to bury Cabbage Corp for an eternity.
9841,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Saikhan,"Yeah, yeah. That's what they all say ..."
9842,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Reporter,Is it true that Cabbage Corp is conspiring with the Equalists?
9843,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,"The evidence points in that direction, but the investigation is ongoing. For the time being, we have frozen Mr. Gan-Lan's assets and are closing Cabbage Corp."
9844,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tahno,"Hey, Korra."
9845,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Tahno?
9846,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"Listen, I know we're not exactly best friends, but I'm sorry Amon took your bending."
9847,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tahno,"I've been to the best healers in the city. Whatever Amon did to me, it's permanent. You gotta get him for me."
9848,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,"Mr. Sato, if you remember anything else about what you saw during Amon's attack, be sure to let us know."
9849,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,I'm happy to help any way I can. I want these Equalists to pay for what they've done.
9850,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,We're ready for you now.
9851,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tahno,"See you around ... ""Ah""vatar."
9852,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,Earthbending bomb!
9853,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Butler,Avatar Korra ... has arrived.
9854,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"Hey, Korra!"
9855,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,Glad you made it!
9856,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,Welcome to paradise!
9857,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Looks like you guys settled right in.
9858,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"Pretty much, except ''someone'' forgot to ask her father if we could stay here."
9859,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"Yeah, but I smoothed it over with him. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."
9860,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,"''This'' is the greatest place in the world! Watch this, watch this. Fetch me my towel, good sir."
9861,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Butler,"Yes, Master ... Bolin."
9862,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,"Master Bolin! Ha, I love this guy. Now pat me dry."
9863,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Butler,As you wish.
9864,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,Don't forget Master Pabu.
9865,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Butler,"Wouldn't dream of it, sir."
9866,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,I had something a little more exciting in mind.
9867,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"Pretty cool, huh?"
9868,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Way cooler than a makeover.
9869,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,This is where Future Industries test-drives their Satomobiles. Ever been behind the wheel?
9870,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog.
9871,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,You want me to take you for a spin?
9872,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Let's do it!
9873,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,That was amazing! I didn't think we'd make it.
9874,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"Well, you can't be afraid to mix it up sometimes."
9875,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"It's all right, people usually assume that I'm daddy's helpless little girl, but I can handle myself. I mean, I've been in self-defense classes since I was this high. My dad made sure that I would always be able to protect myself."
9876,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Smart guy.
9877,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,"Emergency, emergency coming through, beep beep!"
9878,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"Uh, is there another bathroom I can use?"
9879,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"We have a lady's powder room upstairs, first door on your right. You can freshen up in there."
9880,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Thanks.
9881,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"No, no! No, I assure you, everything is going exactly as planned. Uh-um, yes ... luckily, the Cabbage Corp investigation has bought us enough time. Trust me, by the end of the week ... we'll be ready to strike!"
9882,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,You're leaving? But I-I thought ...
9883,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"Uh, sorry! I forgot, I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids. See you later!"
9884,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,"So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists then framed Cabbage Corp?"
9885,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,"That's a bold accusation, but what proof do you have?"
9886,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"Well, I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard. Sato's up to something."
9887,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,He does have the means ... and he has a motive.
9888,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,That's right.
9889,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,A motive? What is it?
9890,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,"Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion. A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break in."
9891,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,That's terrible.
9892,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,It was tragic. It's possible that he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.
9893,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,Maybe we ''should'' look at Mr. Sato a little more closely.
9894,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,What's going on? Why are they asking Hiroshi more questions?
9895,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"I overheard him on the phone yesterday. Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists."
9896,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,What? I don't believe this.
9897,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,You spied on Hiroshi? What's your problem?
9898,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,"Mr. Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you."
9899,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,My father is innocent. Just because we're not benders doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists.
9900,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,Equalists? Is that what this is about? I can assure you I have nothing to do with those radicals.
9901,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, Korra."
9902,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"I overheard you on the phone. You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time, and you're getting ready to strike. Explain that!"
9903,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"This is all just a misunderstanding, resulting from the young Avatar's overactive imagination. My number one competitor was knocked out of the game. It's providing me an opportunity to ''strike'' the market with a new line of Satomobiles. It's just business. Nothing nefarious."
9904,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,"In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?"
9905,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"If you feel it's necessary, you're welcome to search all of Future Industries."
9906,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,News reporter,"Is it possible, presidents of Cabbage Corp and Future Industries both have Equalist ties, or did Hiroshi Sato frame his longtime rival, Lau Gan-Lan? Or did Chief Beifong just plain arrest the wrong man? So far the investigation has yielded no evidence to incriminate Sato."
9907,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,I can't believe we didn't find anything.
9908,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,It would appear Hiroshi is innocent.
9909,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"Okay, you did your search. Now you can all leave."
9910,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,Hmm.
9911,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"So, I hope you're convinced now."
9912,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"No, I'm not! I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying."
9913,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,Why are you doing this? Are you that jealous of me and Asami?
9914,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,What? Don't be ridiculous! That has nothing to do with it!
9915,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"If you don't drop this, consider our friendship over."
9916,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,I'm sorry. Hiroshi is ''not'' the man you think he is.
9917,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,Hmph.
9918,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"I think you guys should hear this. ""If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight."""
9919,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Warehouse worker,"Psst. Over here. Listen, I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said. I thought he could make life better for us nonbenders. But I didn't sign up for this ... this war."
9920,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?
9921,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Warehouse worker,He manufactured those gloves for the Equalists.
9922,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,I knew it!
9923,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Warehouse worker,And there are rumors he's working on something even bigger. Some new kind of weapon.
9924,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.
9925,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Warehouse worker,That's because he has a secret factory.
9926,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Where?
9927,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Warehouse worker,It's right underneath the Sato Mansion.
9928,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,Raiding the Sato Mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck. If we're wrong ...
9929,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,I know. I can kiss my job goodbye. But protecting Republic City is all I care about. We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.
9930,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,What are you doing here?
9931,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,We have a reason to believe that there's a factory hidden below the mansion.
9932,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,I think I would've noticed if there were a factory underneath my house. The lies you people come up with just to persecute my father.
9933,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,Where is your father?
9934,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"In his workshop, behind the house."
9935,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,Dad? Hello?
9936,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Officer,"Chief, the estate's been secured. No one has left the workshop since we arrived."
9937,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,Perhaps we just couldn't see him leaving.
9938,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,There's a tunnel beneath the workshop running deep into the mountainside.
9939,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?
9940,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,I don't understand. There must be an explanation.
9941,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,Maybe you don't know everything about your father. I'm sorry.
9942,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,"Officers, into the tunnel. Be cautious. Uh-uh, you three stay up here. Officer Song, keep an eye on them."
9943,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,Not your average backyard workshop.
9944,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,And I'm guessing ''those'' are the new weapons.
9945,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,"Hiroshi was lying all right, but where is he?"
9946,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,What was that?
9947,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,We need to get down there and see what's going on.
9948,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Song,Absolutely not. You're staying put until the chief comes back.
9949,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"All right, we'll stay put. But could we wait outside or something? It's so dusty in this workshop."
9950,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Song,No! We're waiting right here!
9951,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"Okay, but don't blame me if I start sne- if I start sn-sn-sneez-"
9952,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Song,"What's your problem, bub?"
9953,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"I'm about to- Sorry pal, we know you were just doing your job."
9954,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,"Yeah, just stay put until the chief comes back. That's sounds very familiar doesn't it, why? Because you said it."
9955,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"Asami, you should stay here. We'll check it out."
9956,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,I have to find out the truth about my father.
9957,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"I understand. That's why I'm going down, to find out for you. Please."
9958,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,All right. Be careful.
9959,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"I'm afraid you won't be able to metalbend that wall, Chief Beifong. It's solid platinum. My mecha tanks are platinum as well. Not even your renowned mother could bend a metal so pure."
9960,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"Hiroshi, I ''knew'' you were a lying, no good Equalist! Come out here and-"
9961,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"And do what, young Avatar? Face the wrath of your bending? No. I think I'll fight from inside here where my odds are a little more ... equal."
9962,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,That source was a set-up! You lured us down here!
9963,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,Guilty as charged.
9964,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,Korra!
9965,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"Well, I'd say that was a near flawless test run. Load everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon!"
9966,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,Oh no.
9967,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,"Korra was right. We gotta do something, quick!"
9968,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"Not so fast, boys."
9969,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Bolin,"Hello, Mr. Sato. Wow! What a really swell, scary factory you have here under your giant mansion."
9970,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"Yes, and the most difficult part was watching my daughter traipse around with a firebending street rat like you!"
9971,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"Dad, stop! Why?"
9972,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Hiroshi Sato,"Sweetie, I wanted to keep you out of this as long as I could. But now you know the truth, please, forgive me. These people, these ''benders. ''They took away your mother, the love of my life. They've ruined the world, but with Amon we can fix it and build a perfect world together. We can help people like us, everywhere! Join me, Asami."
9973,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,No ...
9974,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Asami,"I love you, Dad."
9975,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,Let's get out of here!
9976,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,"My metalbenders are on their way to Amon, and it's all my fault. Tarrlok's right, I've failed as chief. First thing in the morning, I'm handing in my resignation."
9977,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Tenzin,No! You can't give up like this!
9978,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Lin,"I'm not giving up. I'm gonna find my officers and take Amon down. But I'm gonna do it my way, ''outside'' the law."
9979,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,I'm sorry I didn't believe you. But Asami's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe. Even now.
9980,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,I know. I'm sorry this whole thing happened.
9981,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,So ... does your offer to live in the Air Temple still stand?
9982,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"Of course it does. And Asami's welcome, too."
9983,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Mako,Thank you so much.
9984,2,The Aftermath,Air,1,68,Korra,"After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako."
9985,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Shiro Shinobi,"Republic City is at war! After discovering that her father, Hiroshi Sato, is working with the enemy, Asami turns against him, and following another defeat at the hands of the Equalists, Lin Beifong resigns as Chief of Police. With the Equalist army growing stronger, who will help the Avatar stop Amon and restore balance to the city?"
9986,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Ikki,You're finally here! Welcooome to Air Temple Island. Your new home.
9987,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Meelo,"Yes, welcome to my domain."
9988,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Meelo,What's that fuzzy creature?
9989,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Jinora,That is a fire ferret. An arboreal mammal common to the bamboo forests of the central Earth Kingdom.
9990,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Meelo,Yip yip! Fly sky bison! Fly!
9991,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,Thanks for sending the Air Acolytes to help us with the move.
9992,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,"Yes, they've been amazing. Such tireless workers."
9993,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Oh, I thought you were only bringing a ''few'' things."
9994,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,"Trust me, it could've been worse."
9995,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"No problem, everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome."
9996,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Meelo,"You're pretty, can I have some of your hair?"
9997,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,"I have a couple of questions. Is this an all vegetarian island? Is that where you train airbending? Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes? Do we each get our own sky bison? And final question, how many trees are on this island?"
9998,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Ikki,Yes. Yes. No. No. Ten thousand five hundred and fifty two.
9999,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,"So, where are we going to be staying?"
10000,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Meelo,You're a boy. Boys have to stay on the boys' side.
10001,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Jinora,I'd be happy to show you to the men's dormitory.
10002,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,I'm a boy!
10003,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Meelo, why don't you go with the boys too?"
10004,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Meelo,"We shall meet again soon, beautiful woman."
10005,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Ikki and I will take you to your room this way.
10006,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Ikki,"Asami, did you know Korra likes Mako?"
10007,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,"Oh. Uh, no. I wasn't completely aware of that."
10008,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Ikki,Hey!
10009,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"So, here's your room. I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to."
10010,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,"I think it's really charming and the best part about it, nothing here reminds me of my father. Thank you for your hospitality."
10011,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"Good day, ladies. Asami, welcome to the island."
10012,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,Thank you for having me.
10013,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"Beifong's replacement, Saikhan, is going to be inducted as the new Chief of Police later. I think we should both be there."
10014,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Saikhan,"It was an honor serving under Chief Beifong for so many years and I wish her a speedy recovery. It is with great humility that I take her place as the new Chief of Police. Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen but there is one man who's been effective against Amon's revolution, Councilman Tarrlok. That is why for all matters involving the Equalists, I will report directly to him. The police department will lend any and all available resources to the councilman and his task force until we quell this insurgency."
10015,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,What is that weasel snake Tarrlok up to now?
10016,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Oh, Tenzin. Always the conspiracy theorist. Did you ever consider Saikhan simply recognizes my talents and wants what is best for this city? Well, Avatar Korra. Long time, no see. Now that your little pro-bending distractions are over, I look forward to your return to my task force."
10017,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Ha! Forget it! There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.
10018,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"That is unfortunate to hear, but I'm sure you'll come to your senses as you have in the past."
10019,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Don't hold your breath, bub. You know, Tenzin's been right about you all along. You played me, you played Beifong, and now you're playing the new Chief too. Well, I got news for you. You need me, but I don't need you. I'm the Avatar."
10020,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"I don't understand what's wrong with me. I've memorized nearly all of the practice forms, but I still can't produce a single measly puff of air! I'm a failure."
10021,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,No you're not. You just need to work through this airbending block.
10022,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Amazing advice. I'll get right on that.
10023,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"I wasn't finished yet. You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers, but also his past lives to call upon for guidance. Have you ever made contact with your past lives?"
10024,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"No, of course I haven't. Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus? I'm a spiritual failure, too."
10025,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,You may have made a connection without realizing it. Perhaps something you mistook as a dream?
10026,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Maybe. I had a few weird hallucinations, but I hardly even remember them."
10027,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,And did you see any previous Avatars in these visions?
10028,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,I saw Aang. It seemed like he was in trouble. What do you think it means?
10029,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"Hmm, I don't know. But I urge you to meditate on these visions. I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something."
10030,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,Korraaa!
10031,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,I'm fine.
10032,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,"Come on, what's wrong? You can tell us."
10033,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,How am I suppose to save this city when I can't even learn airbending? I'm the worst Avatar ever! I just feel ... alone.
10034,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,"No, that's nonsense! You're amazing!"
10035,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,Yeah and remember. Aang hadn't mastered all the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid.
10036,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,"And he wasn't alone. He had his friends to help him. Look, the arena might be shut down but we're still a team. The ''new'' Team Avatar!"
10037,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,"We got your back Korra, and we can save this city. Together."
10038,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Yeah, let's do it!"
10039,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Meelo,"Yeah, let's do it! What are we doing?"
10040,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,"Get ready, Republic City. You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar."
10041,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,"Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits."
10042,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon.
10043,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"All right, Let's ride."
10044,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,Naga away!
10045,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"All right, scratch that. Any other ideas?"
10046,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,Hmm. I think I have the answer.
10047,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,You think this'll do?
10048,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,I like the new Team Avatar's style.
10049,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Police dispatcher,"Unit two sixteen, cancel that ten fifty-eight at Harmony Tower. Come back to the station, over."
10050,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars. I guess now I know why.
10051,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Police dispatcher,"Calling all units, Level Four Alert. Jailbreak at headquarters. Officers down, electrocuted. Chi blockers and Equalist convicts are still at large armed and dangerous. Last seen heading east. I repeat, Level Four Alert. Equalist jailbreak!"
10052,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,Chi blockers!
10053,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,That's them!
10054,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Let's get 'em!
10055,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,Korra! Bolin! Give me a ramp! Now!
10056,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,Help me out! We gotta make this turn!
10057,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,"They don't know we made the turn. Okay, get ready."
10058,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Avatar Korra, what do you think you are doing?"
10059,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Oh, hey Tarrlok. Nice of you to show up finally. Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you."
10060,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.
10061,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Hmm, that's funny. I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time. If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would've gotten away."
10062,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,This is your last warning. Stay out of my ''way''!
10063,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom, but the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down. The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists or even be associated with them. It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall."
10064,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"This is going too far, Tarrlok! You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few!"
10065,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands. We must pass this law. All in favor?
10066,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Police dispatcher,"All available units, please respond to the fifty six hundred block of Dragon Flats borough. Equalists have taken to the streets, consider them armed and dangerous. Proceed with caution."
10067,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,I call front!
10068,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,After you.
10069,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"What a gentleman, thanks!"
10070,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Why is the power out?
10071,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,"Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous."
10072,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Sure doesn't look that way.
10073,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Saikhan,"All nonbenders, return to your homes immediately."
10074,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Saikhan,"Disperse, or you will all be arrested."
10075,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Everyone, please stay calm. I'm gonna put a stop to this. Tarrlok, you need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone."
10076,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here."
10077,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,We're not going anywhere. You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals.
10078,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,This is an Equalist rally. There is nothing innocent about it.
10079,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,"They're not Equalists, they're just normal people who want their rights back."
10080,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,They are the ''enemy''! Round up all these Equalists!
10081,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Stop!
10082,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Asami,Hey! Let me go!
10083,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,You're under arrest!
10084,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,What? You can't do that!
10085,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Actually, I can. She's a nonbender out past curfew and her father is a known Equalist conspirator."
10086,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,Let her go!
10087,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,Arrest him and his brother!
10088,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Tarrlok!
10089,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Unless you want to join your friends in prison, I suggest you put those down and go back to the Air Temple."
10090,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Mako,"Korra, listen to him. It's not worth it."
10091,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Bolin,We'll be all right.
10092,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin. He can get you out."
10093,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,So sad to see your little ''Team Avatar'' broken up. You had a good run.
10094,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"This isn't over, Tarrlok."
10095,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Oh, I believe it is. Take them away."
10096,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Hey!
10097,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,I came as fast as I could. Are your friends all right?
10098,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,I don't know! These knuckleheads won't tell me anything.
10099,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"I'll take care of this. Saikhan, a word please."
10100,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Saikhan,"Councilman Tenzin, I'm pretty swamped at the moment. Can this wait?"
10101,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"No, it cannot. Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. I'd like you to release them immediately."
10102,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Saikhan,They're not going anywhere. They were interfering with police business.
10103,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Your so called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists. They should be released, too."
10104,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Saikhan,All Equalists suspects are being detained indefinitely. They'll be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat.
10105,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,Those people are entitled to due process under the law.
10106,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Saikhan,You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok.
10107,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"Oh, I plan to. At the council meeting, first thing in the morning."
10108,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,You're officially the worst Chief of Police ever!
10109,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tenzin,"Calm down, Korra. I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient. But you really ''are'' the worst! ''Ever!''"
10110,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Wake up, Naga. Let's go."
10111,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"Wait for me here, girl. Don't worry, I'll be all right."
10112,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,You and I need to talk.
10113,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,Are any of the other council members here?
10114,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Council page,I believe everyone has gone home for the night.
10115,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,Then you should do the same.
10116,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Council page,"Are you sure, sir?"
10117,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,Leave us. You obviously have something on your mind? Spit it out.
10118,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Don't you see? You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders. You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people!
10119,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,And you don't?
10120,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Of- Of course not!
10121,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Isn't that what you came here to do? Intimidate me into releasing your friends. See, that's what I admire about you, Korra. Your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want. It is a quality we both share."
10122,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,You and I are ''nothing'' alike!
10123,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Look, I'll make you a deal. You fall in line and do what I say and I'll release your friends."
10124,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,That's why you arrested them? To get to me?
10125,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,I need your answer.
10126,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,You need to be stopped! You're just as bad as Amon!
10127,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"I've tried to work with you, Korra, but you've made it impossible."
10128,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Still think that I'm a half-baked Avatar?
10129,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"What are you gonna do now? You're all out of water, pal."
10130,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"You're in my way Avatar, and you need to be removed."
10131,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,"You're, you're a bloodbender?"
10132,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,Very observant.
10133,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,It's not a full moon! How- how are you doing this?!
10134,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,There are a lot of things you don't know about me.
10135,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,Where are you taking me?
10136,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Tarrlok,"Somewhere no one will find you. Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again!"
10137,2,When Extremes Meet,Air,1,69,Korra,You can't do this! Let me out! Garh!
10138,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Shiro Shinobi,"The Avatar has been abducted! After Tarrlok arrested her friends, Korra confronted the councilman in his chambers. But the heated argument quickly turned into an all-out bending battle! Desperate to save himself, Tarrlok revealed his ability to bloodbend and took Korra far from Republic City. Will the Avatar's friends find her before it's too late?"
10139,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Meelo,Who is this? It's ''six'' in the morning! This better be important!
10140,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,Councilman Tenzin here. What?!
10141,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,What happened? What was Korra doing at City Hall?
10142,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Radio,"We interrupt your regularly scheduled broadcast to bring you this special report. Late last night, Equalists attacked City Hall, subduing Councilman Tarrlok and capturing Avatar Korra. Details are still coming in, b-"
10143,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,"Hope you got enough beauty rest. Come on, I'm busting you out."
10144,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,Thanks. I owe you.
10145,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Are you done yet?
10146,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,Cover your ears! I can't go with you listening.
10147,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Asami!
10148,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,"Ahh! A little privacy, please!"
10149,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Are you all right?
10150,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,I'm fine! It's so good to see you.
10151,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,"Hate to break up your lovers' reunion, but Korra's in trouble. Amon captured her."
10152,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,"No. No, she can't be gone!"
10153,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,"Come on, we have an Avatar to rescue."
10154,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,Thanks for catching that.
10155,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Korra,Somebody! Help! Please! Please.
10156,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,I urge you to meditate on these visions. I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something.
10157,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Aang,"Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't get involved, but if what those victims said is true, we're not dealing with a normal criminal."
10158,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Toph,"Fine. Follow me, Twinkle Toes."
10159,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Aang,"Toph, I'm forty years old. You think you could stop with the nicknames?"
10160,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Toph,'Fraid not.
10161,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Toph,"It's over! You're under arrest, Yakone!"
10162,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Aang,"We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone. We know what you are."
10163,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Toph,Take him away.
10164,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Korra,"Whoa. I finally connected with you, Aang. But, what are you trying to tell me? A way out of this box would be nice."
10165,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,I figured you could use our help finding Korra.
10166,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Do you have any leads?
10167,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,"I've been on the phone all morning, but nothing yet."
10168,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,We need Naga! She can track Korra.
10169,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,I'm afraid her polar bear dog is missing as well.
10170,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,Then where do we start?
10171,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,My guess is the Equalists are hiding underground in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.
10172,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,Underground ... just like my father's secret factory. Figures.
10173,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,"Yeah! Yeah, that makes sense! When those chi blockers had me in their truck, it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!"
10174,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,I know where to start looking! Come on!
10175,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,"Wherever Amon is keeping Korra, I bet that's where my officers are too."
10176,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,"Let's bring them all home, Lin."
10177,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,The truck with Bolin took off down this alley.
10178,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,Which way?
10179,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,Hmm. This way kinda ... smells familiar.
10180,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,There's a tunnel nearby.
10181,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,There!
10182,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,Motorcycle tracks.
10183,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Korra has to be in there ... somewhere.
10184,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Let's try this way.
10185,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,And what if Korra's not down there?
10186,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Then we pick another tunnel until we find her!
10187,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,"Hey, is Mako all right? He seems really worried about Korra."
10188,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,"Yeah, we all are!"
10189,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,"I know, but, he's your brother. Do you think that he likes Korra as more than just a friend?"
10190,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,"W-What? No! That's, just gossip, where'd you hear that? Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now. Heh ..."
10191,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,"Nothing! I mean, there was this one time during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but-"
10192,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,They ... kissed?
10193,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,"Believe me, I was upset too, but, I'm over it. I don't think it meant anything."
10194,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,I doubt that.
10195,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,Hide!
10196,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Equalist traffic director,That tram goes to the training camp.
10197,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Female Equalist,"Everything was delivered to the prison, sir."
10198,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,That's where they must be keeping Korra.
10199,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,We need to get down that tunnel.
10200,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Equalist,It's empty!
10201,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Equalist,"Yeah, I can see that."
10202,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,"You two, keep an eye on them."
10203,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,My officers are inside.
10204,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,What about Korra?
10205,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,I don't see her yet.
10206,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Avatar Korra. Where are you keeping her?
10207,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Officer,Chief Beifong?
10208,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,"I'm too late. That monster already took your bending, didn't he?"
10209,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,"I'm so sorry. Come on, let's gets you out of here."
10210,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Equalist,"We don't have the Avatar, and the Equalists didn't attack City Hall. Tarrlok's lying."
10211,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,I scanned the entire prison. Korra's not here.
10212,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Why would Tarrlok make up a story about getting attacked?
10213,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,Because ''he'' has Korra. He fooled us all!
10214,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,"Let's go, people!"
10215,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,"Try to chi block that, fools!"
10216,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,We've got more company! Hang on!
10217,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Prosecution attorney,"Yakone has ruled Republic City's criminal empire for years. Yet he has always managed to stay out of the law's reach, until now. You will hear testimony, from dozens of his victims, and they will tell you, Yakone has maintained his grip on the underworld by using an ability that has been illegal for decades. Bloodbending."
10218,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Defense attorney,"The prosecution's entire case is built upon the make-believe notion that my client is able to bloodbend at will, at any time on any day. I remind the council that bloodbending is an incredibly ''rare'' skill and it can only be performed during a full moon. Yet, the witnesses will claim that my client used bloodbending at every'' other'' time ''except'' during a full moon. It would be a mockery of justice to convict a man of a crime that is impossible to commit."
10219,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bailiff,Councilman Sokka will now deliver the verdict.
10220,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Sokka,"In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities. Why, I once bested a man with my'' trusty'' boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind. Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history until our esteemed Chief of Police, Toph Beifong, singlehandedly developed the skill. The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence has convinced this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders and he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes. We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison."
10221,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice.
10222,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Saikhan,Lin.
10223,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,Have you news of Avatar Korra?
10224,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,I am shocked you would accuse me of such an evil act! I already explained: Equalists attacked us and took her!
10225,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,"But there were no chi blockers here last night. You planted the evidence, didn't you?"
10226,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,That is a ''ridiculous'' accusation!
10227,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Council page,"It's true! He took her! I was here when Avatar Korra arrived last night, but Councilman Tarrlok ordered me to leave. I was on my way out when I saw Tarrlok bring her down to the garage."
10228,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,"Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again."
10229,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,That is nonsense! Everyone knows you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar!
10230,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,Why did you wait until now to 'fess up?
10231,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Council page,I was terrified to tell because ... Because Tarrlok is a bloodbender! He bloodbent Avatar Korra!
10232,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,Don't make this worse for yourself. Tell us where you have Korra.
10233,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,Wake up!
10234,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,Ughh! Man! I had this awful dream that Korra was taken by this evil bloodbender. So weird.
10235,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Asami,"Bolin, that really happened. He knocked us out."
10236,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Bolin,Are you serious? Where is he? Is he here right now?
10237,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Saikhan,Tarrlok is long gone. I'll alert the whole force.
10238,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,We've only been out for a little while. Maybe we can still pick up Tarrlok's trail.
10239,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,It could lead us to Korra! Let's go.
10240,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Aang,Yakone. You won't get away with this!
10241,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Yakone,"Republic City's mine, Avatar. I'll be back one day to claim it."
10242,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Yakone,This time I'm gonna put you to sleep for good!
10243,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Korra,Aang ... this whole time ... you were trying to warn me about Tarrlok.
10244,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,"My life is a disaster now, thanks to you."
10245,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Korra,So your little bloodbending secret's out? And I know how you bloodbent me without a full moon. You're Yakone's son.
10246,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,"I ''was'' his son, but in order to win Republic City, I had to become someone else. My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly. My plan was perfect. I was to be the city's savior. But you, you ruined everything!"
10247,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Korra,"Tarrlok, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go."
10248,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,"Oh no. No, I'll escape and start a new life. And you're coming as my hostage."
10249,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Korra,You'll never get away with this!
10250,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,Amon!
10251,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Amon,It is time for you to be equalized.
10252,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,You fool! You've never faced bending like mine.
10253,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tarrlok,What? What are you?
10254,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Amon,''I'' am the solution.
10255,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Amon,I'll take care of him. You four retrieve the Avatar. Do not underestimate her. Electrocute the box to knock her out before you open it.
10256,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lieutenant,My pleasure.
10257,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lieutenant,It's payback time.
10258,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lieutenant,Open the box. Tie her up.
10259,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Korra,Naga. You came looking for me. Good girl.
10260,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,That sounds like Naga! Down there!
10261,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Tenzin,"Korra! Oh, thank goodness."
10262,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Lin,Where's Tarrlok? How did you get away?
10263,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,Give her some space! I was so worried. Are you all right?
10264,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Korra,I'm fine. I'm glad you're here.
10265,2,Out of the Past,Air,1,70,Mako,You're safe now.
10266,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Shiro Shinobi,"Amon's revolution grows stronger by the day. First, he attacked the bending arena! Then it was discovered that Hiroshi Sato was the mastermind behind the Equalist gloves and mecha tanks! And most recently, Amon ambushed Councilman Tarrlok, took his bending, and nearly captured the Avatar as well! Everyone is on edge, wondering where will Amon strike next?"
10267,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Jinora,"Daddy, you're home. We waited up for you. Is Korra okay?"
10268,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Yes, she's fine, sweetie."
10269,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Ikki,I was scared. I thought she wasn't coming back.
10270,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"I'm sorry you were scared, but everything is going to be fine now. I promise."
10271,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"Mmm. Mmm. The food tastes amazing, Pema. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again."
10272,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,We're so thankful you're home safe.
10273,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,Let me help.
10274,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Korra, I realize you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened."
10275,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"Well, first off, Tarrlok isn't who he says he is. He's Yakone's son."
10276,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,It all makes sense now. That's how Tarrlok was able to bloodbend us without a full moon.
10277,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,But how did you escape? And where's Tarrlok?
10278,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"Amon captured him, and took his bending."
10279,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,What?
10280,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere. He almost got me, too."
10281,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"This is very disturbing news. Amon is becoming emboldened. Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar ... I fear Amon is entering his endgame."
10282,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,"Pema, are you all right?"
10283,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,"The baby is ... just kicking, really hard, is all. I'm fine."
10284,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,Should I get Tenzin?
10285,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,"No reason to worry him, it's nothing."
10286,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,Can I get some hot water? Korra needs more tea.
10287,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,You're a firebender. Boil it yourself.
10288,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,I'm- gonna step out in case you two want to talk.
10289,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,Is there something we need to talk about?
10290,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,"I've noticed how you treat Korra. How you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?"
10291,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,What? No! She was taken by a crazy bloodbender! How did you expect me to act?
10292,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,I like Korra. But you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time.
10293,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,The truth? About what?
10294,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,You're really going to make me say it?
10295,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,Yes! Because I don't know what you're talking about!
10296,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,"The kiss, Mako. I know."
10297,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,Don't blame your brother for what ''you'' did. Do you have feelings for Korra or not?
10298,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,"Look, things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later?"
10299,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,Asami!
10300,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,Spit it out already!
10301,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Will you stay here and watch over Pema and the children while I meet with the council? With everything that has happened lately, I want to be sure my family is in safe hands."
10302,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,"Of course I'll help, old friend."
10303,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,I didn't realize you two were ''out'' here.
10304,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Pema! Ye- yes- yes, Lin has agreed to help out around here and keep an eye on things while I'm away."
10305,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,Thank you! I could use the extra pair of hands. Would you mind giving him a bath? He's filthy.
10306,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Thank you, Lin! Oogi, yip yip."
10307,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Meelo,I gotta poo! Really bad!
10308,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Councilwoman,Do you know where my keys are? I can't find them ''anywhere''!
10309,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Councilwoman,"Oh, found them!"
10310,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Husband,"Good, dear."
10311,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Husband,"The door, dear."
10312,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lieutenant,We're here to fix a spider-rat problem.
10313,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Councilwoman,I didn't call an exterminator.
10314,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Husband,Dear?
10315,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Council page,"Aah! Ah, I'm so relieved to see you!"
10316,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,The other council members. Are they all right?
10317,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Council page,I'm afraid not! I just received a call from Chief Saikhan. They've all been captured!
10318,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,This can't be happening.
10319,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Council page,The leadership of Republic City is in your hands now.
10320,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Council page,It is a tragic day indeed!
10321,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,"All right, kids, time to go inside."
10322,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"We heard explosions, what's going on?"
10323,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,Republic City is under attack.
10324,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Hiroshi Sato,I've dreamed of this day for so long.
10325,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Amon,"Yes, the time has come for the Equalists to claim Republic City as their own."
10326,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,Where did you say you parked the car?
10327,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,It's right around here somewhere. There it is.
10328,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,"Wow, nice parking job."
10329,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"Hey, you guys got arrested and left me alone with the car! I made it very clear I don't know how to drive."
10330,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Bolin,All things considered you did a great job! But how are we going to pay for all these parking tickets?
10331,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,"Relax, the city is under attack. The police have more important things to worry about."
10332,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,This'll come in handy. Why don't you sit in back? With ''Korra.''
10333,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,I think I will.
10334,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,Everything all right?
10335,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Bolin,"Car! Oh, we're good."
10336,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Saikhan,Send a river rescue unit.
10337,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Female telegraph operator,"Chief, all the river rescue ships have been sabotaged!"
10338,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Saikhan,What?
10339,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,Chief Saikhan.
10340,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Saikhan,"Tenzin, am I glad to see you. I was afraid you'd been captured too."
10341,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,I'm the only Council member left. What's the status?
10342,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Saikhan,Amon has launched simultaneous attacks across the boroughs. The police are trying to regain control but we're spread too thin.
10343,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,The general of the United Forces.
10344,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Female telegraph operator,"Chief, the phone lines just went dead!"
10345,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Saikhan,Catch.
10346,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Saikhan, the vents. We need to evacuate immediately. Everyone stay close to me."
10347,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,Not these mecha tanks again!
10348,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Saikhan, no!"
10349,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Asami,Jump!
10350,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,Thank you.
10351,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Hiroshi,Tenzin has escaped once again. I can't stand to see Asami fighting alongside those ''benders.''
10352,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Amon,We'll capture them before long and you will have your daughter back.
10353,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,Are you all right?
10354,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"I'm fine. Thank you, kids. Another moment later and I would have been on my way to Amon."
10355,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,"Uh, guys ... look."
10356,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,Oh no.
10357,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Ikki,"Mommy, what's wrong?"
10358,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,The baby's coming!
10359,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Jinora,Oh no!
10360,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Meelo,"Not now, baby!"
10361,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,"The children, where are they?"
10362,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Air Acolyte woman,"Don't worry. They're in the other room, totally safe."
10363,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Jinora,Stay away from my dad's ex-girlfriend!
10364,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,Jinora! You shouldn't be out here!
10365,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Ikki,Get off our island!
10366,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,Girls! You need to go back inside ''this'' instant!
10367,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Meelo,Taste my fury!
10368,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,Meelo! Be careful!
10369,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,Never mind.
10370,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,"Take these Equalists and lock them in the temple's basement! Nice work, kids."
10371,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Jinora,Dad!
10372,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Oh, thank goodness you're all right!"
10373,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Meelo,We caught the bad guys.
10374,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,You let them fight? Do you realize what could have happened?
10375,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,"I would have been toast if it weren't for your kids. You should be proud. You taught them well. Go on, be with your wife."
10376,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,Pema!
10377,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,Tenzin.
10378,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"I'm here, Pema."
10379,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,Our new son.
10380,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Hello. Come, meet your new brother."
10381,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Meelo,A brother? Well it's about time!
10382,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Ikki,"Welcome, I'm Ikki, and this is Jinora and Meelo. We have a super great family and we're so happy that you're a part of it."
10383,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Jinora,What're you gonna name him? Can I pick?
10384,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Pema,We already chose a name.
10385,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,Rohan.
10386,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Ikki,"Everything's ''not'' gonna be fine, is it, Daddy?"
10387,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"What do you want to do, Tenzin?"
10388,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"I need to protect my family, and get them as far away from this conflict as possible. If Amon got his hands on my children ... I hate to even think of it."
10389,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,"If you're leaving, then I'm going with you."
10390,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,But-
10391,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,No arguments. You and your family are the last airbenders. There's no way in the world I'm letting Amon take your bending away.
10392,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Thank you, Lin. Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being."
10393,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,I'm not giving up.
10394,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"I'm not asking you to. I sent word to the United Forces. They will be here soon. And once my family is safe, I will return. With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war."
10395,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"What you're saying is, we need to be patient."
10396,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"You're learning well. Stay safe, Korra."
10397,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,You too.
10398,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,"Tenzin, if we're leaving, we'd better do it now."
10399,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Oogi, yip yip!"
10400,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"Everyone, climb on! Let's go, girl!"
10401,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Bolin,Mustache guy!
10402,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Korra,"Nice one, Naga!"
10403,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,They're gaining on us!
10404,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Faster, Oogi!"
10405,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,"Whatever happens to me, don't turn back!"
10406,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Lin, what are you doing?!"
10407,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Meelo,That lady is my hero.
10408,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Tenzin,"Yes, she is."
10409,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Mako,"Korra, we should get moving."
10410,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Amon,Tell me where the Avatar is and I'll let you keep your bending.
10411,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Lin,"I won't tell you anything, you monster."
10412,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Amon,Very well.
10413,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Messenger,"General, I just received a wire from the Avatar. She says Amon and his forces have gained control of the city. How do you want to respond?"
10414,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Iroh,"Tell her we will be arriving in three days' time. And that I look forward to winning back Republic City, together."
10415,2,Turning the Tides,Air,1,71,Messenger,"As you wish, General Iroh."
10416,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Shiro Shinobi,"The Equalists are on the attack! The Lieutenant and his chi blockers invaded Air Temple Island and forced Tenzin and his family to flee! In the daring escape, Lin Beifong sacrificed herself and saved the airbenders, but she was captured and Amon took her bending away. Now, Team Avatar is in hiding as they await help from General Iroh and the United Forces."
10417,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,Relax. General Iroh's coming with an entire fleet of battleships. Then Amon will be the one who's running.
10418,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"I hate this ""being patient"" stuff."
10419,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Asami,You two were gone a while.
10420,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,We were ''doing'' reconnaissance.
10421,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Asami,Whatever.
10422,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Gommu,"Welcome back! Hope you worked up an appetite, 'cause dinner is served."
10423,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,Thanks so much for letting us hide out with you the past few days.
10424,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Bolin,You are a wise and noble hobo. ''Mmmm.'' This is the best-tasting street gruel I've ever had. Seriously!
10425,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Gommu,I culled it from the finest dumpsters the city has to offer!
10426,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,Can't sleep either?
10427,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"No, I have this awful pit in my stomach."
10428,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,Me too.
10429,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"I know, we didn't even know each other then. And now, I can't imagine my life without you in it. You're the most loyal, brave, and selfless person I've ever known."
10430,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"I think you're pretty incredible too, but ... you already knew that."
10431,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,I should probably try to get some sleep.
10432,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,Me too. Good night.
10433,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,Good night.
10434,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,Coast is clear.
10435,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"Once the United Forces arrive, we need to be ready to help in any way we can."
10436,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,They're here!
10437,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Bolin,Whoops!
10438,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,Hmm ... Amon had to know we were coming. So why aren't we meeting any resistance?
10439,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,Wait a second ... where are the Equalist airships?
10440,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"I don't see any mecha tanks, either."
10441,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,"Something's not right. It's a trick! Water and earthbenders, detonate those mines! What is that sound?"
10442,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,What now?
10443,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Bolin,Where does Hiroshi find the time to keep inventing new evil machines?!
10444,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Male sailor,Incoming!
10445,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"It's all right, I've got you."
10446,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,Avatar Korra? You saved my life. Thank you.
10447,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,"I was prepared to deal with Sato's mecha tanks, but not these new high-speed aircraft."
10448,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"I know. Every time we think we have an advantage, Amon outsmarts us."
10449,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Bolin,"No matter what our plan is, he always has a better one."
10450,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,"Amon is winning so far, but we're not out of the fight yet."
10451,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Bolin,"I like this man's confidence! So, how are we not out of the fight?"
10452,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,"A second wave of reinforcements is on the way, but I need to warn them. Do you still have a way to get a message out?"
10453,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,I know just the man for the job.
10454,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Gommu,And ''who'' is the recipient of this top secret message?
10455,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,Commander Bumi. Second division of the United Forces.
10456,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,Tenzin's brother?
10457,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,"Yes, bit of a wild man, but the bravest commander you'll ever meet."
10458,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Gommu,"Ready, sir."
10459,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,"Fleet ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft. Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal. Do not approach city until you receive the all clear. Now comes the hard part. We need to ground those aircrafts. Otherwise, Bumi's fleet would never be able to retake the city."
10460,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,They flew in from this direction. The airfield must be somewhere over this mountain range.
10461,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,"Everyone get ready, we leave at dawn."
10462,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Asami,It's time to take down my father.
10463,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"Wait, I'm sorry, but I'm not going with you tomorrow."
10464,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,What?
10465,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Asami,Why not?
10466,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon. It's time I face him.
10467,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,That's not a good plan. We need to stick together.
10468,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down. My guts tell me it's time to end this, on ''my'' terms."
10469,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,"Korra, this is not a mission you should be handling alone."
10470,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,She won't be. I'm going with you.
10471,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,You don't have to do that.
10472,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"Yes, I do."
10473,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Iroh,Hmm ... My grandfather would respect the Avatar's instinct. So will I.
10474,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"Love you, little bro."
10475,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Bolin,"Love you back, big bro. Korra, Amon is a nasty dude. Be careful."
10476,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"I will. Good luck. If you're going into the mountains, you should bring Naga. Take good care of Bolin for me."
10477,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"Asami. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us, but whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you."
10478,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Asami,"I care about you, too."
10479,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Gommu,"Good fortune and success to you, valiant heroes."
10480,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,There's Amon.
10481,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"We need to get into the temple. Then, when he returns ..."
10482,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,We ambush him.
10483,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Lieutenant,What are you two doing here?
10484,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"Uh, we were just transferred."
10485,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Lieutenant,"Well, you're getting transferred again. Amon wants extra security at the arena today."
10486,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,The arena? For what?
10487,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Lieutenant,The rally. You should've been briefed about this.
10488,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"We'll be there, sir. I know another way in."
10489,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,Let's hide in the attic.
10490,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"Uh, we're not alone up here."
10491,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,Tarrlok?
10492,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,I don't suppose you're here to rescue me.
10493,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,We had no idea you were here. Are there other prisoners on the island?
10494,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"No, I'm the only one."
10495,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,And what makes you so special?
10496,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"I'm Amon's brother. Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe. He's a waterbender and a bloodbender, just like I was."
10497,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,What?
10498,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,Did you know this all along?
10499,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"No, not until after he captured me."
10500,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,How did your brother end up becoming Amon?
10501,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"It all began with my father, Yakone. With the help of his former gang, he escaped prison and underwent surgery to change his appearance. He assumed a new identity, and settled down in the Northern Water Tribe. That's where he met my mother, a warm, caring woman. Before long, they started a family together. Amon was the firstborn, under the name Noatak. I was born three years later. Noatak was a good-natured kid, always looking out for me. Those were the good years. Before my brother and I discovered we were waterbenders. At first we were excited by our new abilities, but our training brought out a different side of my father."
10502,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,"Tarrlok, you'd better shape up or you'll be out here in the cold all night until you get it right."
10503,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"I'm trying, but-"
10504,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,Try harder! Your brother was never this sloppy.
10505,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Noatak,"Dad, he'll get it. He just needs time."
10506,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,"Don't talk back to me, son! Ever!"
10507,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"Even back then, my brother wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally. When I was seven, my father took me and Noatak on a hunting trip far away from our home. He told us his true identity was Yakone, Republic City's most notorious crime boss, and that he was once a bloodbender of rare skill."
10508,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,What's bloodbending?
10509,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,"The most powerful and feared form of bending in the world. It was declared illegal thanks to that coward, Katara. Our family has the strongest line of bloodbenders in history. You boys have this power inside of you, and I will teach you to master it."
10510,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Noatak,"What happened to ''your'' bending, Dad?"
10511,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,"The Avatar stole it from me. That's why I brought you out here, to learn your destiny. You two will become bloodbenders of the highest order. When the time is right, you will claim Republic City and you will destroy the Avatar. You must avenge me. ''That'' is your purpose in life."
10512,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"The good days were behind us. Every full moon, our father took us on another supposed ""hunting trip,"" where he secretly trained us in bloodbending. We kept the truth from my mother."
10513,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,Stop! You're hurting it!
10514,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,"Toughen up, Tarrlok! You'll need a thicker skin for this. Very good, son, very good."
10515,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"A few years later, my father taught us to bloodbend anytime, without the need of the full moon. We practiced constantly, and I hated every minute of it. I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals. My brother, however, seemed to revel in this newfound power. He was a prodigy, mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen."
10516,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,That's the way it's done. That's what you need to strive for.
10517,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,"Noatak, go! Excellent. Tarrlok, your turn."
10518,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,No. I won't do it.
10519,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,"Bloodbend your brother, Tarrlok!"
10520,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,That felt awful. I don't want to do that to anyone. I never want to bloodbend again.
10521,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,"You're a disgrace, a weakling. I'll teach you a lesson, you insubordinate-"
10522,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Noatak,Stay away from him.
10523,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,How dare you bloodbend me!
10524,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Noatak,"What're you gonna do about it? ''You're'' the weak one. You always say bloodbending is the most powerful thing in the world, but it isn't. The Avatar is. He took your ''bending'' away. What could be more powerful than that?"
10525,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Yakone,I made you what you are. You're mine.
10526,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Noatak,"We're your sons, not your tools of revenge. Let's go. We can run away from him. Forever."
10527,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,Run away? But what about Mom? We can't just leave her.
10528,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Noatak,He was right about you. You ''are'' a weakling.
10529,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,Noatak! Don't leave! Please! Noatak!
10530,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"My father and I searched for days, but we never found a sign of Noatak. We thought he perished in that storm. My mother was never the same after the loss of my brother. My father stopped training me. With Noatak gone, his hopes for revenge withered. And he passed away, a few years later."
10531,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,That's one of the saddest stories I've ever heard.
10532,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"Avatar Korra. I am truly sorry for all that I did to you. I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me. I became a soldier of revenge, just like he wanted me to be. And so did my brother. The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes bending is the source of all evil in the world."
10533,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,How did you figure out Amon is your brother?
10534,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"When he took my bending, the sensation was somehow familiar. I later recognized it as my brother's bloodbending grip."
10535,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"So, he somehow uses bloodbending to take people's bending."
10536,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,"I don't know ''how'' he does it, but then again, I've never encountered a bender as strong as Noatak."
10537,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,How in the world do we beat him?
10538,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,"We can't. Any attack we throw at him, he'll redirect with his mind. That's how he's been able to challenge any bender."
10539,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"So much for our ambush. If we stay here, we're toast. But there's another way to beat him."
10540,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,How?
10541,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"This whole time, Amon has been one step ahead of us. But finally ''we'' have the advantage. We know the truth about him. If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters ..."
10542,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,At the rally.
10543,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,... We could take away his true power!
10544,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Mako,And undermine this whole revolution!
10545,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Korra,"Thank you, for your help. We can't just leave him here."
10546,2,Skeletons in the Closet,Air,1,72,Tarrlok,Go. Amon can't know anyone spoke with me. Defeat him. Put an end to this sad story.
10547,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Shiro Shinobi,"Korra and Mako have discovered the truth about Amon's identity. He's a waterbender, a bloodbender, and brother to Tarrlok! Now, Korra and Mako plan to infiltrate the Equalists' victory rally and expose Amon as a fraud. Meanwhile, Asami, Bolin, and General Iroh head toward Hiroshi's secret airfield, where Asami intends to take down her father?"
10548,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Iroh,"I think we've found our secret airfield. Bolin, once we get down there, I need you to tear up those runways. We can't let those aircraft take off."
10549,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,"Aye aye, captain! Ooh, general, general. All right, you guys wait here until we get back, okay? Uh-uh, stay."
10550,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Asami,Why would there be fence posts but no fence?
10551,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,"Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion! When I was a boy, a firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred. That tragic event began my quest to equalize the world."
10552,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,"That's a lie, Amon! Or should I call you Noatak?"
10553,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Lieutenant,You want her taken out?
10554,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,Amon has been lying to you. The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away. He uses bloodbending to do it. Amon is a waterbender!
10555,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Lieutenant,What is this nonsense?
10556,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,"You're desperate, Avatar. Making up stories about me is a pathetic last resort."
10557,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,"Your family wasn't killed by a firebender. His father was Yakone, and his brother ... is Councilman Tarrlok."
10558,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,"Hmph, an amusing tale, but I will show you the truth. ''This'' is what a ''firebender'' did to me."
10559,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,What?
10560,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,We said what we had to. Let's get out of here.
10561,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,"I wouldn't leave yet, Avatar. You'll miss the main event."
10562,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,No ... they got away. We saw them get away!
10563,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Hiroshi Sato,"Asami. Asami, I know I have hurt you ... and I am sorry. But I believe that one day, you will come to your senses and we can be a family again."
10564,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Asami,Are you insane?! How can we be a family after everything you've done?! Mom would hate you for what you've become.
10565,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Hiroshi Sato,How dare you? ''I'' am avenging her death!
10566,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Equalist,"The airplanes are ready for take-off, sir."
10567,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Hiroshi Sato,"Good, annihilate the fleet."
10568,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Hiroshi Sato,"That's right, general. I intercepted your message to Commander Bumi. I know ''exactly'' where they're hiding."
10569,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Asami,How are we gonna get out of here?
10570,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Iroh,I don't suppose you know how to metalbend?
10571,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,"That is a negative, Sir."
10572,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,Naga! Over here!
10573,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,Who needs a metalbender? We got Naga! Yeah!
10574,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,"Ahh! No, Naga!"
10575,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Asami,"Huh, what do you know ... just like a Future Industries forklift."
10576,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,"Tonight, I rid the world of airbending, forever."
10577,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,"Amon, let them go!"
10578,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,You're welcome to come down here and try to stop me.
10579,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,He's trying to bait you.
10580,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,I don't care! We have to save them!
10581,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,The Avatar needs to be reminded of the power I possess.
10582,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,Where are Pema and the baby?
10583,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tenzin,In prison.
10584,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,Beifong?
10585,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tenzin,I don't know.
10586,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,"Follow me, kids."
10587,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,Get them out of here. We'll create a diversion.
10588,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tenzin,Let's go get your mother and the baby.
10589,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Meelo,Prison break!
10590,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,Let her go!
10591,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,No!
10592,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,Korra!
10593,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,I told you I would destroy you.
10594,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Iroh,"Thanks for looking out for me, Aang."
10595,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,Whoa! Thanks Naga.
10596,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Hiroshi Sato,"Asami, what do you think you're doing? You are aiding the very people who took your mother away!"
10597,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Asami,You don't feel love for Mom anymore. You're too full of hatred.
10598,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Hiroshi Sato,"You ungrateful, insolent child!"
10599,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Hiroshi Sato,I now see there is no chance to save you!
10600,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,"Mr. Sato, you are a horrible father!"
10601,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Asami,You really are a horrible father.
10602,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,"Finally, you are powerless."
10603,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Lieutenant,"Amon! Everything the Avatar said is true, isn't it? I just saw you bloodbend her. You traitor! I dedicated my life to you!"
10604,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,"You've served me well, Lieutenant."
10605,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,Mako ... my bending.
10606,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,Everything will be all right! We just need to get out of here.
10607,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten the better of me like that. It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented. Almost.
10608,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,No!
10609,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Amon,Impossible!
10610,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,I - I can airbend? I can airbend!
10611,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,No ... you ... ''don't''!
10612,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Protester,Evil Avatar!
10613,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Feathered hat man,He ''is'' a bender.
10614,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Protester,Whoa!
10615,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tarrlok,Noatak.
10616,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Noatak,"It's over, brother. I'm sorry for what I had to do to you."
10617,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Noatak,"Leave with me now. We have a second chance. We can start over, together. Please, you're all I have left in the world."
10618,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Lin,I can't believe Amon got you too.
10619,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,"Hey, at least you unlocked your airbending!"
10620,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,"Bro, not the time."
10621,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bolin,"Right, right, I'll just stand over here quietly, in silence."
10622,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tenzin,You saved Republic City.
10623,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,But Amon got away.
10624,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Ikki,"Yay, Uncle Bumi's here!"
10625,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Bumi,Waaaa-hoooo!
10626,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tenzin,"Great, now I have to entertain my brother."
10627,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Noatak,"The two of us together again, there's nothing we can't do!"
10628,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tarrlok,"Yes, Noatak."
10629,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Noatak,"Noatak. Hmph, I had almost forgotten the sound of my own name."
10630,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tarrlok,It will be just like the good old days.
10631,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Katara,"I've tried everything in my power, but ... I cannot restore Korra's bending."
10632,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Lin,"But you're the best healer in the world, you have to keep trying!"
10633,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Katara,"I'm sorry, there's nothing else I can do. Korra can still airbend, but her connection to the other elements has been severed."
10634,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tenzin,It's going to be all right Korra.
10635,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,"No, it's not."
10636,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,"Korra, wait."
10637,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,Go away.
10638,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,"I will, but I just want you to know, I'm here for you."
10639,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,"No, I mean, go away, back to Republic City. Get on with your life."
10640,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,What are you talking about?
10641,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,I'm not the Avatar anymore. You don't need to do me any favors.
10642,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,"I don't care if you're the Avatar or not. Listen, when Tarrlok took you I was losing my mind at the thought of never seeing you again, I realized ... I love you, Korra."
10643,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,I - I can't.
10644,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Mako,Korra!
10645,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tenzin,We need to be patient with her. It will take time for her to accept what has happened.
10646,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,"Not now Tenzin, I just want to be left alone."
10647,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Aang,But you called me here.
10648,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,Aang.
10649,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Aang,You have finally connected with your spiritual self.
10650,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,How?
10651,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Aang,"When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change."
10652,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Korra,I love you too.
10653,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Lin,Thank you.
10654,2,Endgame,Air,1,73,Tenzin,"I am so proud of you, ''Avatar'' Korra."
10655,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Shiro Shinobi,"Six months ago, Avatar Korra defeated Amon and the Equalists. Since then the council was disbanded and the United Republic elected its first president. Tenzin's brother, Commander Bumi, retired and moved to Air Temple Island. And Korra and her boyfriend Mako have been the talk of the town. Peace has come to Republic City, but unbeknownst to the Avatar, danger now threatens the Southern Water Tribe."
10656,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Old salt,This your first watch?
10657,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Greenhorn,Mmhmm.
10658,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Old salt,"Well then, better keep your eyes peeled laddie. Ya never know what creatures lurk in the murky depths."
10659,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Greenhorn,"Uh, Sir!"
10660,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Old salt,What?
10661,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Greenhorn,Man overboard! Man overboard!
10662,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Shiro Shinobi,"Iiiiit's pro-bending night in Republic City, and have we got a ''doozy'' for ''you''! Fan favorites, the Fire Ferrets, are about to take on hot newcomers, the Rhino Lions!"
10663,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,Where's Mako when I need him?
10664,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,Looks like you had some car trouble. Good thing the police are here.
10665,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Asami,I think these planes are finally ready to ship.
10666,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Engineer,"I hate to mention the elephant-rhino in the room, but since your father was thrown in prison, no company will work with us. We're nearly bankrupt."
10667,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bumi,The Avatar is the winner!
10668,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Ikki,No fair! You can't go into the Avatar State to win!
10669,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,You did what!? The Avatar State is not to be used as a booster rocket! You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate!
10670,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,It's the Avatar State and I'm the Avatar. Who appreciates it more than me?
10671,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"Clearly you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections, not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending."
10672,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bumi,Looks pretty good to me.
10673,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,Is it too late for you to unretire from the United Forces?
10674,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"You've mastered Korra style airbending, now you need to master real airbending. Hopefully our visit to all the air temples will give you the inspiration you need to look more deeply into your studies."
10675,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Jinora,Can we see where Grandpa Aang was born?
10676,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Meelo,How many lemurs can I have?
10677,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Ikki,"I wanna get tattoos! But instead of arrows, I want lightning bolts!"
10678,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Jinora,You can't get lightning bolts. That doesn't make any sense.
10679,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Ikki,''You'' don't make any sense!
10680,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Meelo,"Fight, fight, fight!"
10681,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"No one's fighting! We're going to have a wonderful time! Now that the president is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs."
10682,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Great, ''more'' attention."
10683,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bumi,"Hah! Relax ... I'd pay money to see that. Maybe I'll tag along just to see ""Vacation Tenzin""."
10684,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,You're not invited.
10685,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Before we go on your dad's study trip, we're gonna have some real fun in my home town at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks."
10686,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin's children,Yay!
10687,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bumi,"Yep. There's Vacation Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, Mom already invited me."
10688,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,"So I walk up and say: ""Looks like you had some car trouble. Good thing the police are here."""
10689,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,"Yeah! I had a few others. Let's see, uh ... ""Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad"", huh? Or, ""when you get to jail, tell 'em Mako sent ya""."
10690,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Ooh, I like that one."
10691,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,"Okay, I'll use that next time. Beifong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon."
10692,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,That sounds so fun. All I do is train all day. It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.
10693,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.
10694,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Of course you'd take his side!
10695,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,"I'm not taking his side, I'm just ..."
10696,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,I'm gonna take a walk.
10697,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?
10698,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin's children,Gran Gran!
10699,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Katara,Oh ... you've all gotten so big.
10700,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Jinora,"We missed you, Aunt Kya."
10701,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Kya,"Ohh, I missed you, too. Your father doesn't bring you to visit nearly enough. He's probably scared I'll beat him up like when we were kids."
10702,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,You remember Mako.
10703,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,Sir.
10704,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,Uh ... No ... uh ... I ... no.
10705,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Knock it off, Dad."
10706,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,Wow! Look at all these people that came out to greet us.
10707,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Uh, no. They came to greet ''them.''"
10708,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,The great chief of the Northern Water Tribe comes to grace us with his presence. Hooray.
10709,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Senna,"Just relax Tonraq, he'll be gone soon enough."
10710,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,Whoa! Who are the lovely ladies?
10711,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"That's Eska and Desna, the chief's children. Desna is a guy."
10712,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,"Good to see you again, Avatar Korra."
10713,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Good to see you too.
10714,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,Tonraq.
10715,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,Brother.
10716,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,It's a shame the Southerners have abandoned all connections to the spirits. Even during the most hallowed times.
10717,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival. It's fun.
10718,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,This festival used to be a solemn time of fasting and meditation. Now it's just a chance to watch some rube try to stick an entire arctic hen in his mouth.
10719,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,"What? Oh, it's so good."
10720,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,Traditions change. It's not the end of the world.
10721,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in southern waters. Some traditions have purpose.
10722,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Wait, spirits are attacking ships?"
10723,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that. Apparently you haven't been given all of the information you need. It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.
10724,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits. Airbending is getting pretty boring.
10725,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,Tenzin is Korra's instructor. He can give her all the training she needs.
10726,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,So you've said.
10727,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Asami,"I'm glad you came with me to this meeting. Varrick is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the entire global shipping business. So, you're my assistant. Just stand there and don't say anything."
10728,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Varrick,Did ya see that? Levitation! I was a foot off the ground! Is that incredible or what?
10729,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,You looked like you were just sitting on a pillow.
10730,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Varrick,Are you saying I wasn't levitating?
10731,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,Uh ... no?
10732,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Varrick,"Well, why didn't anyone tell me? Now I look like an idiot! Swami, you're fired! I like you, kid, you're a real straight shooter, just like me. Miss Sato, he's with you? Brought your tiger shark with ya to do business, huh? Now that's moxie! Get over here and pop a squat. Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests!"
10733,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Asami,"Thank you for meeting with me. As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping."
10734,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Varrick,"Sure! But first you gotta check out my new venture! Moving pictures! Zhu Li, do the thing! You're gonna love this! Mind-blowing, right?"
10735,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,Yeah.
10736,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Varrick,"Now forget that! That's the past! Shut it off, Zhu Li! Imagine watching this! Ginger, come over here and do your poses."
10737,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Asami,Okay ... but I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track. If we could hammer out a deal ...
10738,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Varrick,Stop! Look me in the eye.
10739,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,Is that how business usually goes?
10740,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Asami,You ''are'' a natural assistant!
10741,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle."
10742,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,"This is nothing. When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits. People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky."
10743,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Wow, I've never seen that."
10744,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,"And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits. That is why I want so badly to teach you. To help you fulfill your destiny."
10745,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,I thought I had made it clear that Tenzin is teaching her.
10746,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn. It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.
10747,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?
10748,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,We all did what we thought was best for you.
10749,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's."
10750,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bumi,Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the Avatar's stick-in-the-mud mentor.
10751,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Kya,"Bumi, don't pick on Tenzin. You know he's always been sensitive."
10752,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,I'm not sensitive!
10753,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,"As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits. But I am saddened to see what it has become: a cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans. I feel the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course."
10754,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Varrick,"Chief Unalaq everybody, always great to have him in town. Now, let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's Dancing Otter penguins!"
10755,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,Wish me luck. I'm making my move! Whee!
10756,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,Good luck.
10757,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Those two have always creeped me out. They smell like a grandma's attic.
10758,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,"Hey, I'm Bolin. I'm a friend of Korra's! You're, uh, Eska right? Wow, I'm just, I am loving these robes. So, you are from the north right? Cool, that's, like you know, that's my favorite direction."
10759,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Desna,I think he is trying to establish some kind of bond with you based on your geographic point of origin.
10760,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,"You mean like a boyfriend, or like a slave ...?"
10761,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Eska,Yes. Win me prizes.
10762,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Unalaq offered to train me. He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them.
10763,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,Sounds good. What does Tenzin think?
10764,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids. I'll never finish training with him in charge.
10765,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Game guy,We have a winner!
10766,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"I mean, you heard what Unalaq said. The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it, but my dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me. Well?"
10767,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,Well what?
10768,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,What do you think I should do?
10769,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,I guess you should do what you think is right. I support whatever decision you make.
10770,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Oh thanks. That's a big help.
10771,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,I thought you wanted me to be supportive? Now you want me to tell you what I think? Make up your mind!
10772,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Just forget it.
10773,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"Uh, Naga what are you doing? Naga, hush! Quiet, Naga, you'll wake everyone up!"
10774,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,"Uh, What's going on?"
10775,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"What, is, that?"
10776,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bolin,Got it! Don't got it!
10777,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,Korra!
10778,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"Spirit, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you?"
10779,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,Go in peace.
10780,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,Korra!
10781,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,Are you all right?
10782,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,How are you able to control that spirit when no one else could?
10783,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,"As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know."
10784,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable, but Korra still has much to learn about airbending. And I hope that going to the air temples will help her connect with the past Avatars."
10785,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Ugh
10786,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,The air temples will teach her nothing. Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.
10787,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tonraq,I've told you that will not happen!
10788,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Hey! I'm right here! Anyone want to ask me what I think?
10789,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"Korra, please listen."
10790,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"I'm tired of listening to you. Both of you. You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best. But both of you were powerless against the spirit attack. I think it's time I had a new teacher."
10791,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn. I have to go with him.
10792,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together."
10793,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,"I'm sorry, Tenzin. This is as far as we go."
10794,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"It has been a pleasure serving you, Avatar Korra."
10795,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Katara,I think you forgot a couple of things.
10796,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now."
10797,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Katara,"This is your family, Tenzin. When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings. Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together."
10798,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Bumi,Come on! It'll be fun.
10799,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Kya,"I'm dying to see that laid back, Vacation Tenzin I've heard so much about."
10800,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Tenzin,"All right, hop on! I love you, Mom. We'll see you soon!"
10801,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Korra,Do you think I did the right thing?
10802,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Mako,"I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing. But I know your heart is in the right place. You'll just have to trust it. ."
10803,2,Rebel Spirit,Spirits,2,74,Unalaq,"I know this was a hard decision, Korra, but it was the right one. Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training. I have great plans for you."
10804,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Shiro Shinobi,"The Southern Water Tribe is under siege! When Avatar Korra was attacked by a dark spirit, Chief Unalaq was the only one able to stop it. So, Korra turned her back on Tenzin and chose Unalaq as her new spiritual mentor. Tenzin and his family left for a vacation at the Southern Air Temple, while Korra remained in the Water Tribe. Will she be able to restore balance between humans and spirits?"
10805,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,You're early.
10806,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,What can I say? I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting.
10807,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits, I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training. We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe, the South Pole."
10808,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,You're going to train me at the South Pole?
10809,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"We will do more than just train. By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves, and now it threatens to destroy our tribe. We must set things right. The Southern Water Tribe depends on you."
10810,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,A dangerous trip to the South Pole? Count me in!
10811,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tenzin,"There it is, the Southern Air Temple. Isn't it magnificent?"
10812,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Shung,"Master Tenzin, welcome!"
10813,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tenzin,"Good to see you again, Abbot Shung."
10814,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Shung,"Is there anything you need? Water? Dandelion greens? Ahh, perhaps you'd like to recenter yourself by meditating in the gardens?"
10815,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tenzin,"No thank you, I'm fine."
10816,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Shung,"And you must be the honorable Pema! Please, accept these gifts. This is an ancient airbender head shaver we've refurbished just for you."
10817,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tenzin,Oh. Okay?
10818,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Shung,"And Pema! These flowers once filled the mountainside! Now, they can brighten up your room."
10819,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Pema,That's ... sweet? Y-you didn't have to.
10820,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Shung,Nonsense! Whatever you need is yours. Anything for the mother of the next generation of airbenders.
10821,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Ikki,No! That gift is mine!
10822,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Jinora,You don't even like to read!
10823,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Ikki,Eeeh!
10824,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Pema,"Yep, those are the world's next generation of airbenders."
10825,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Meelo,"Mommy, Daddy, look! I finally got a lemur! I'm gonna name him ... Poki!"
10826,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Meelo,Poki! Come back!
10827,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bumi,"S'cuse me, a little help here?"
10828,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Acolyte,"Sorry, I thought you were the servants."
10829,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bumi,We're Tenzin's brother and sister!
10830,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Acolyte,Avatar Aang had other children? The world is filled with more airbenders?
10831,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Kya,We're not airbenders.
10832,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Acolyte,Oh ... I'm so sorry.
10833,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,I thought you said Bolin was coming?
10834,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,"He said he'd be here, but I can't worry about it. I have to make sure you have everything you need for a safe trip."
10835,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Thanks, Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine."
10836,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"Tonraq, what do you want?"
10837,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,I heard you're taking Korra to the South Pole. I'm coming.
10838,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,Absolutely not. You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done.
10839,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,My daughter is not going without me! She needs someone to watch after her.
10840,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?"
10841,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"Because he's misguided. The sad truth is, it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance. He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since."
10842,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,What happened in the past?
10843,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,It doesn't matter. What matters is the Everstorm.
10844,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,The Everstorm?
10845,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Guys! Hey, wait for me!"
10846,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Check it out, I'm traveling in style! Okay, uh, sorry, still getting used to that throttle."
10847,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,"Uh, where'd you get the ride?"
10848,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"No, the conversation is over. Dad, come if you want, just don't interfere with my training. ."
10849,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Eska,Does this sidecar have the capacity for two passengers?
10850,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Sure does. But, uh ... who's gonna drive?"
10851,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,"Well, what do you know? Looks like--"
10852,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Go away, Mako."
10853,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"So once we get to the South Pole, then what happens?"
10854,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,You will open an ancient spirit portal.
10855,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"I'm sorry, what now?"
10856,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"At the South Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the Spirit World, but it has long been closed."
10857,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,And that's why the evil spirits are attacking?
10858,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"There are no evil spirits, there is light and dark in them all. But when they're unbalanced, the darkness takes over. If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restored."
10859,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,What do you mean ... in time?
10860,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ends on the winter solstice. That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together. Only then can the Avatar open the portal.
10861,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,The winter solstice is tomorrow.
10862,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"Exactly, and we can't afford to wait another year."
10863,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Easy, Naga."
10864,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,What are those?
10865,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,Dark spirits.
10866,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,Let's keep moving. We have to find a safe place to set up camp.
10867,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Uncle, why do you think the dark spirits are following us?"
10868,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Can we not talk about dark spirits, please?"
10869,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,My brother doesn't like ghost stories.
10870,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Eska,"Don't worry. I will protect you, my feeble turtle duck."
10871,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,Thank you.
10872,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"Unalaq, this is not the time."
10873,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,You're right. You should have told her a long time ago.
10874,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,Told me what!?
10875,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,I left the North Pole because ... I was banished.
10876,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,You were banished from the North? Why?
10877,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"Because I almost destroyed the entire tribe. Twenty years ago, I was a general in the Northern Water Tribe, sworn to protect my people."
10878,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Young Unalaq,Brother! We're being attacked!
10879,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,I drove them out of the city and deep into the frozen tundra.
10880,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"We tracked them deep into an ancient forest. Many believed this forest was the home to spirits, and the barbarians retreated there because they thought we wouldn't attack them on such hallow grounds. They thought wrong."
10881,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"We captured the barbarians, but in the process, we destroyed the forest. I didn't realize the consequences of what I had done. By destroying the forest, I unknowingly let loose angry spirits."
10882,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"They threatened to destroy everything, the entire city."
10883,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"Unalaq was able to guide the spirits back to the forest. But by then, the damage had been done. For being the cause of so much devastation, my father banished me from the Northern Water Tribe in shame."
10884,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,That's when I came to the South and started a new life.
10885,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Whoa, so ''you'' were supposed to be chief, then ''he'' became chief. No wonder you guys don't like each other. Ow! What? Isn't that what happened?"
10886,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,I can't believe you kept this from me.
10887,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,I was protecting you from the shame I brought on the family.
10888,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,Why did you keep hiding things from me and then telling me it's for my own protection? I'm tired of you ''protecting'' me!
10889,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,Korra!
10890,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Jinora,"Wow, the statue room."
10891,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tenzin,"That's right, Jinora, the most sacred place in the entire Southern Air Temple. Here, you will find statues of ''every'' Avatar who ever lived. Where are your brother and sister?"
10892,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Meelo,You can't catch me! I've the greatest air scooter-er of all time!
10893,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tenzin,Meelo!
10894,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"Korra, you have every right to be mad at me. But I don't want you to make the same mistake I made. I should never have gone into that forest, and we shouldn't be going to the South Pole now. Spirits and the physical world should remain separate."
10895,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Dad, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits and the physical world, and I finally have a chance to live up to my potential."
10896,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,You don't even know if what Unalaq says is true.
10897,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,The Northern Lights.
10898,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"Yes. There used to be lights at the South as well, but during the Hundred Year War, the South was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared. When the War ended, the North helped to rebuild you ''physically'', as a nation, but we have not rebuilt you spiritually. Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies. Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm."
10899,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,I think we're here.
10900,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,Is that what I think it is?
10901,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,We ''must'' keep moving.
10902,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Oh man, I really don't like this."
10903,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,"Bolin, just stay calm, there's no reason to- panic!"
10904,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"Korra, look out!"
10905,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Oh, it's in the engine! Aaaahhhhh!"
10906,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,Is everyone okay?
10907,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,Aaaahhhhh!
10908,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,I can't stop it!
10909,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Eska,I'll save you.
10910,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,I'm a raft!
10911,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Uhhh, can someone please deflate me? Thank you."
10912,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,"Oh, great. There goes our equipment. Now what are we supposed to do?"
10913,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,There's only one thing ''to'' do. We have to turn back.
10914,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,No! The solstice is tonight. And we're so close.
10915,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,This mission is too dangerous. We're leaving.
10916,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"No, Dad, ''you're'' leaving."
10917,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,"Don't worry sir, I'll keep an eye on Korra for you."
10918,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,"Thank you, Mako."
10919,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,Let's open this portal and lead your father and the entire Southern Water Tribe in the right direction. We don't have much time.
10920,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,Then what are we waiting for?
10921,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"So, what exactly were you and my dad talking about?"
10922,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,"Nothing, he was just worried about you, that's all."
10923,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Y'know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on."
10924,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,There aren't any sides. We all just want to help however we can. You have to trust that we're here for you.
10925,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,We've arrived.
10926,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,Trees frozen in the ice.
10927,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,It's just like the sacred forest Tonraq destroyed in the North.
10928,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"So, what do I do?"
10929,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"You must find your way to the heart of the forest where the dormant spirit portal lies. From here, you're on your own."
10930,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,"Wait a second, there's no way she's going alone."
10931,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Yeah! If she goes, we go, too!"
10932,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,The Avatar must go alone.
10933,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"But I don't have any connection with the spirits. In fact, it seems like they hate me."
10934,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"You have to believe in yourself, like I believe in you. What is it?"
10935,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,I guess I'm just so used to people telling me how to do things that I forgot what it was like to have someone trust in me.
10936,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"Korra, all the past Avatars live on inside of you. Let them guide you. Let them help you find the light in the dark."
10937,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Wait here, I'll be okay."
10938,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,Good luck.
10939,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,The spirit portal. Amazing.
10940,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Jinora,Whoa. What Avatar is this?
10941,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,The light in the dark.
10942,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,Why isn't it opening?
10943,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Come on portal, open!"
10944,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"The spirits, dancing in the sky."
10945,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,I can't believe it.
10946,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,It's beautiful.
10947,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Tonraq,She did it.
10948,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Bolin,"Hey, Korra, you're back. Hey, Korra's back!"
10949,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Eska,Why are you initiating physical contact with another woman?
10950,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,Everything you said was true.
10951,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,"Avatar Korra, you have taken the first step in bringing balance back to the South, and soon the whole world."
10952,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,You never cease to amaze me.
10953,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,"Thanks. By the way, I'm really sorry for being a total pain. Things were really stressful and pretty confusing. It's hard being the Avatar."
10954,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Mako,It's harder being the Avatar's boyfriend.
10955,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Korra,What are all your Northern troops doing here?
10956,2,The Southern Lights,Spirits,2,75,Unalaq,Opening the spirit portal was only the first step in getting the Southern Water Tribe back on its righteous path. There's more difficult work to be done before our two tribes are ''truly'' united.
10957,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Shiro Shinobi,"Korra has reopened the Southern spirit portal and taken the first step to restoring balance between spirits and man. Meanwhile, tensions are high between Korra and her father after she discovered he was hiding a dark secret. Years ago, Tonraq was banished from the North. And now the Northern navy has landed on Southern shores. What other plans does Unalaq have for the Avatar?"
10958,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Northern soldier,"Everyone, clear the streets! Get back in your homes."
10959,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?"
10960,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,"Now that you've opened the Southern portal, we need to protect it from the people who would do the spirits harm."
10961,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,''I'' can protect it.
10962,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,"I need you for something more important. There is another portal, in the North. Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds."
10963,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"But, the solstice is over. How am I going to open it?"
10964,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,"The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North. And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well."
10965,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"With both portals open, our tribes will be united again."
10966,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,The ''world'' will be united again.
10967,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since- Aaand, it's over."
10968,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Gooood morning, Universe."
10969,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"Bumi, please, cover yourself."
10970,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Well, lookee here, ""Vacation Tenzin"" has finally decided to join us."
10971,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Yes, he has. It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family. Isn't that right, my little Rohan? And I've really enjoyed having you two around. Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad."
10972,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"Uhh, I think your memory's a little foggy. Bumi and I weren't on those ''great'' vacations. It was always just ''you'' and Dad."
10973,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"No, that can't be right. What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant koi?"
10974,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"Nope, we weren't there."
10975,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Hmm. Oh, remember Ember Island? Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach."
10976,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"You mean, ''you'' built? We never saw the place."
10977,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,I could've sworn.
10978,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Morning, kids!"
10979,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Meelo,"Morning, Uncle Bumi! Do you have a baby in there?"
10980,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Pema,Where's your sister?
10981,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Jinora,Who?
10982,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Pema,Ikki. About this tall. Talks real fast. I'm sure you know her.
10983,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Jinora,Uhh ...
10984,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Meelo,"There was a lemur fight, but the bison told us not to worry because a giant was coming. Then we almost got eaten by a shark-squid!"
10985,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,The shark-squid? He's here? It appears my old nemesis has found me.
10986,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Pema,"Jinora, were you and Meelo teasing your sister again?"
10987,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Jinora,I don't know. Maybe. Yes.
10988,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Meelo,She ran away.
10989,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Pema,"''Honestly'', I don't know why you kids can't just get along!"
10990,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"It's all right, dear, Ikki couldn't have gone far., I'll find her."
10991,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,Commander Bumi reporting for duty! Search-and-rescue missions are ''my'' specialty.
10992,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,What do you say we all go together?
10993,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Sure, I could use the help."
10994,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"When I get back, we'll come out with a plan to take down that shark-squid once and for all!"
10995,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Meelo,Yeah!
10996,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,"Thank you for coming, everyone. I know these last few days have been very troubling."
10997,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Varrick,"Troubling? Troubling is when I get that itchy rash that won't go away, and Zhu Li's not around to ''scratch'' it. This is shocking. Nay, sickening! But these kale cookies? Opposite. Remind me to get the recipe later."
10998,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,"What's your point, Varrick?"
10999,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Varrick,"My point is, Unalaq's already booted our chieftains out of their palace. How long before he starts telling us what kind of ''cookies'' we can eat?"
11000,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Zhu Li,Probably a couple of days.
11001,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Varrick,"Rhetorical question, Zhu Li, you gotta keep up. Not to mention, I've got a cargo ship full of halibut that's rotting thanks to this harbor lockdown? Who wants to buy a ship full of ''stinking'' fish? Seriously, it's not rhetorical. I need to sell these fish."
11002,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Chief Unalaq is here to help the South. He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.
11003,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Varrick,"The only spirit I'm interested in restoring is our spirit of ''independence''. Am I right, people?"
11004,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.
11005,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Varrick,"No, he wants control of our wealth. ''My'' wealth. And I ''like'' my wealth. If Unalaq doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no ''choice'' but to fight for our ''freedom''!"
11006,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,You want to start a war? Are you crazy?
11007,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,"Unalaq started this, not us. I'm sorry, maybe you could speak with your uncle. Tell him how ''frustrated'' we all are. He'll listen to what the Avatar has to say. Do it for me?"
11008,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,I'll do it for the tribe.
11009,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Varrick,"I cannot stop eating these things. Look, we all know where this conflict is heading. We need to start preparing ''for war''."
11010,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Eska,I will hate to leave this quaint tribe.
11011,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Desna,"Is that true, Eska?"
11012,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Eska,"Of course not, Desna, I will not miss it at all. I hold immense dislike for the South. Bolin, laugh at my humorous quip!"
11013,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"Yes, dear. So-so funny."
11014,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"You know, I'll be ''really'' sad when you have to leave. It's been ''really'' great getting to know you. ''Really.''"
11015,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Eska,But you will be coming with me to the North. There we will live the rest of our lives together in icy bliss. Foolish Bolin.
11016,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,Mako! I'm so happy to see you!
11017,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,"Uh, you all right, bro?"
11018,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"No! No, I'm not all right. I can't take anymore. Listen, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska! Don't make me. Oh, please, please don't make me."
11019,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,"Uh, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her."
11020,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,Break up with her? You can do that?
11021,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,Yeah. Guys do that all the time.
11022,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,How?
11023,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,Just tell her you're not that into her anymore.
11024,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"Oh, no, no, I don't think she'd like that."
11025,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a blood-sucking leech. You just gotta rip it off and get it over with. You'll feel a lot better afterwards. Trust me.
11026,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"Thanks, Mako. Whew. I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts. Ha, Korra better watch out. Oooh, no, it's just a-, uh, you kn-, uh, never mind."
11027,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,Our next training sessions isn't until tomorrow.
11028,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,I'm sorry to interrupt. It's about our conversation this morning.
11029,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,Yes?
11030,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"I understand why you brought your troops here, but I'm afraid it's sending the wrong message."
11031,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,Your father has been talking to you.
11032,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Not just him. Varrick too. There was a meeting at my parents' house. A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.
11033,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,"I am their chief. I'm uniting, not invading."
11034,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war."
11035,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,"If the Water Tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides. The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man. That would be catastrophic."
11036,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,How do we stop it?
11037,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,"We? No, Korra. This is a war only the Avatar can prevent."
11038,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,I'm usually the one starting fights. I don't know how to stop them from happening.
11039,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,"As the Avatar, you must remain neutral in this conflict. You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes finds unity."
11040,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Maybe Tenzin was right. Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.
11041,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,Tenzin lacked faith in you. But I have no doubt that you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.
11042,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Thank you, Uncle."
11043,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Northern soldier,Who threw those?
11044,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Northern soldier,"You hoodlums think you're tough, huh?"
11045,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Southern civilian,Pick on a waterbender your own size!
11046,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Stop!
11047,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Southern civilian,Tell these thugs to go back to the North. They're not welcome here anymore!
11048,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Northern soldier,These Southerners need to stay in line.
11049,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Everyone, calm down. You're all part of the same tribe, start acting like it."
11050,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Southern civilian,You're taking their side? We thought you were one of us.
11051,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,I'm not taking anyone's side. Hey!
11052,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Little girl,You're the worst Avatar ever!
11053,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,"Everyone, walk away from this. They're not worth our trouble. Go back to your homes."
11054,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,"Korra, I- Korra!"
11055,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Ikki! Ikki! Ikki? Ikki, where are you?"
11056,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Over here, Dad! Just kidding. It's me!"
11057,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,There's no sign of her anywhere.
11058,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Why would Ikki run off like this? Ah, it's probably my fault."
11059,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,Probably.
11060,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,Excuse me?
11061,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"I'm guessing you've been so busy with your ""duty"" to Republic City that you forgot about your duty to your kids."
11062,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"""Duty."""
11063,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Kya, you're right. I haven't been spending enough time with them. I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us."
11064,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"Tenzin, your problem is you're ''exactly'' like Dad. He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty, don't laugh, that he never had time for us."
11065,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,Dad was under a lot of pressure.
11066,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"He always had time for you, though, his precious little airbender."
11067,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Dad loved us all ''equally''. Besides, it all happened a long time ago. Why are we even talking about this?"
11068,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"Because you seem to have some grandiose delusion that we had a perfect, happy-go-lucky childhood. Guess what. We didn't!"
11069,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark.
11070,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"See what he's doing there, Bumi? Classic airbender technique. Cutting and running when things get tough!"
11071,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,Uch.
11072,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,Yeah. Did Dad teach you that move?
11073,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,"How was your day, sweetie?"
11074,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Oh, fabulous. My tribe's about to go to war, and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me? No! And I didn't ask for my father's help. Can't he just let me be the Avatar?"
11075,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,"Uh, do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen? I'm still not clear on that."
11076,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Ugh. I'm sorry. My dad just gets me all worked up.
11077,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,"How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff, and we go out for a quiet dinner. Just the two of us."
11078,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"Isn't this fun, huh? We never get to spend enough time together, just the ... five of us. So fun."
11079,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Eska,Excuse us while we retrieve more sustenance.
11080,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,You guys gotta save me.
11081,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,"I though you were breaking up with her. What happened to ""ripping off the leech""?"
11082,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"I tried! But anytime I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin piranhas!"
11083,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Mako,So it was more like you tugged at the leech.
11084,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off. Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands."
11085,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Uh, 'cause I thought it was pretty obvious?"
11086,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bolin,"No, no, not to me it wasn't. I'm very bad at reading people. You should know that by now. Oh, man. Oh! Do something, Avatar!"
11087,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission I commanded years ago in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se."
11088,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,Here we go.
11089,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"For five days we scoured the beast of a mountain, fighting our ways through blizzards, sandstorms, and ''three'' typhoons. Finally, we found the men huddled in a cave, seconds from death. With no time to lose, I piled all ''twelve'' of those poor souls on my back and single-handedly carried them down the mountain to safety."
11090,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki?
11091,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"It was supposed to inspire you. Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men. That's probably why the Avatar fired you."
11092,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,I'm sick of your far-fetched tales. ''Three'' typhoons?
11093,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Well, I may have thrown in an extra typhoon or two for dramatic effect, but-"
11094,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,Quit arguing and bring that lantern over here. I found footprints.
11095,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,Come on!
11096,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"No, follow me! This will get us down fifty times faster."
11097,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"Bumi, it's pitch black and the rocks are slippery. You're going to hurt yourself."
11098,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Come on, you wimps! If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders."
11099,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,Fine.
11100,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"You were right, Bumi! That ''was'' faster!"
11101,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"At least fifty times faster, by my calculations."
11102,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Oh, so Tenzin's the funny guy now."
11103,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"If you need an airlift down, just say the word."
11104,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Bah, I don't need your help. I've got everything under control. Agh!"
11105,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,Bumi!
11106,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Did Dad send you to talk to me?
11107,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,"Your father doesn't know I'm here. Korra, what's going on between you two?"
11108,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Ask Dad.
11109,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,"I've tried, but he won't talk about it. Honey, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this."
11110,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,"So, the truth is out."
11111,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,You knew? And you never said anything.
11112,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,"We were trying to keep our family together, to give you a normal childhood."
11113,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"I never wanted a normal childhood. All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar. But everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents! Unalaq's the only one who believes in me."
11114,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,"That's not true, Korra."
11115,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"No? Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?"
11116,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,The problems between the North and the South started long before you were born. You can't expect to undo them in a day.
11117,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,So I should just sit back and let the Water Tribes go to war?
11118,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,"No, but this situation might be out of your control. Varrick's been plotting a rebellion against Unalaq. He asked your father to join, and-"
11119,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Dad is part of a rebellion?
11120,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,"I don't know, but I don't want you getting caught in the middle of it."
11121,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"It's too late, Mom. I'm already in the middle of it."
11122,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,Korra!
11123,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Uncle! Oh, no. Uncle? Dad? Dad, don't do this."
11124,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Rebel,"Turn around, Avatar, and pretend you didn't see anything."
11125,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"No. Leave Unalaq and go. I'll tell him I tried to stop you, but you escaped. We can still avoid a war."
11126,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Rebel,"No, we can't."
11127,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Rebel,Get him out of here!
11128,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,We're all part of the same tribe. I don't wanna hurt you.
11129,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Dad, stop! Why did you do this, Dad? What? Who are you? Where's my father?"
11130,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Rebel leader,"He wouldn't help us. He's a traitor, just like you."
11131,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,Thank you for saving my life.
11132,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,I'm just glad I got here in time.
11133,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,Find Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors.
11134,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Wait, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier."
11135,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,You want them to go free?
11136,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,No. But let them stand trial for what they did. Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.
11137,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,Very well. I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter.
11138,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Thank you, Uncle."
11139,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,I told you those rocks were slippery. You're lucky you didn't kill yourself.
11140,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"You done with the lecture, ''Mom''?"
11141,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,"Oh, grow up! You haven't changed ''one bit'' since we were kids. You're still trying to prove you can do everything a bender can. Well, you can't. Deal with it."
11142,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,And you're not our mother. You don't get to tell me what I can and can't do. Deal with that. Ugh.
11143,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,Good luck healing yourself with your special nonbending powers.
11144,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Hey, hey, back me up here, Tenzin."
11145,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Kya's right. You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest. ''I'' had to become the responsible one."
11146,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,You think ''you're'' the responsible one? Where were you after Dad died and Mom was all alone? Because ''I'' was the only one who packed up and moved my ''whole'' life to be with her.
11147,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Sure, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself. It was time for you to settle down somewhere. You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire ''culture'' on your shoulders."
11148,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Oh, boo-hoo. Must've been real hard for you, flying around the world with Dad, riding elephant koi all day."
11149,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Oh, so ''that's'' what this is all about."
11150,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,That's what it's ''always'' been about. You think you're some ''savior'' who has to carry on Dad's legacy.
11151,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,Who else is going to do it?
11152,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,How about all of us?
11153,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,"Yeah, we're Aang's kids too."
11154,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,We never should have come on this vacation.
11155,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,I couldn't agree more.
11156,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,"Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place. I can't be around you two right now. Go back to the temple and see if Ikki returned. I'll keep looking out here."
11157,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Bumi,Fine.
11158,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Kya,Fine.
11159,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tenzin,Fine.
11160,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,Is it okay if I come in?
11161,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,Of course. We heard what happened. Are you okay?
11162,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,I'm so glad you weren't there. I don't know what I would've done.
11163,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,"I had no idea how far Varrick was willing to go. My brother and I have our differences, but I would never attack him."
11164,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels. And for all the pain I've caused you and Mom.
11165,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,"I'm the one who should apologize. After I saw the Southern Lights return, I was so proud of you. I never should've held you back."
11166,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Senna,"When your father and I found each other, all we wanted was to live a simple life and raise a family. But, then we discovered you were the Avatar, and simple was over. We knew one day the world would need you, and you wouldn't need us anymore."
11167,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Korra,"Mom, Dad, of course I still need you."
11168,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,We weren't expecting you.
11169,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,"Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial."
11170,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Tonraq,Trial? For what?
11171,2,"Civil Wars, Part 1",Spirits,2,76,Unalaq,For conspiring to assassinate me.
11172,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Shiro Shinobi,"Tensions between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes have reached a breaking point. After Chief Unalaq's troops took over the South, Varrick incited an uprising. But Korra stopped the rebels from abducting her uncle. Enraged by the insurrection, Unalaq arrested the rebels and Korra's parents, accusing them of conspiring to assassinate him. Will Korra be able to save her parents and prevent civil war?"
11173,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,You're making a mistake.
11174,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,"I wish it hadn't come to this. But your parents held meeting with the rebels, right here in their home."
11175,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,I can't believe you're doing this to your own family.
11176,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,"Rest assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial. He is the most fair and honorable man I know."
11177,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"Uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you."
11178,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,I'm sure you're right. So we should have nothing to worry about.
11179,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,I hope so.
11180,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,Where's Varrick? We should've closed our deal an hour ago.
11181,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Would you relax? This place is great. And the best part about it, Eska doesn't know I'm here."
11182,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Ee-yah. I wasn't hiding. Hey, hey-hey, hey."
11183,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Eska,I'm not on the hunt for you. Currently.
11184,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Desna,We search for Varrick. Our father wishes him to stand trial.
11185,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,What did he do?
11186,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Eska,"He is a traitor to the Water Tribe, along with our aunt and uncle."
11187,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,What?
11188,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,Korra's parents were arrested?
11189,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Desna,Yes. Your powers of deduction are impressive.
11190,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Yeah, he's a cop."
11191,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Northern guardsman,Varrick's not here.
11192,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Eska,"Very well. Desna, let us continue our search elsewhere. Boyfriend! Bow to me when I exit."
11193,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Yes, yes, my sweet koala otter."
11194,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Eska,You are so cute when you grovel.
11195,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,Don't let her treat you that way. Stand up for yourself.
11196,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"I tried to break up with her, but ''Mako'' gave me terrible advice. Thank you, Mako."
11197,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,"Wait, how are your girl problems my fault?"
11198,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,"Bolin, you need to be honest with her. Tell her how you really feel."
11199,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Honesty is for fools, kid."
11200,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,Varrick?
11201,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"If you want to ditch this girl, then make yourself scarce. Disappear, like I did."
11202,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,Where are you?
11203,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,Somewhere Unalaq will never find me. Inside Ping-Ping! How we doin'?
11204,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,The coast is clear. You can come out.
11205,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,Your assistant's in there too?
11206,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,Zhu Li never leaves my side. Yuck! Pyugh! Pyuck! You forgot the honey!
11207,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Zhu Li,"Sorry, sir. There isn't any in here."
11208,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,No honey? We're in a ''bear'' for crying out loud!
11209,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,I'm gonna go see how Korra's doing.
11210,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Bolin, I got a little something for you 'round back."
11211,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,Wow!
11212,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Now listen up. Unalaq's rigged this trial, no doubt about it. So I need you to make sure my trusty rebels stay out of prison."
11213,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,What's the money for?
11214,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Bribery, of course! There's always someone willing to look the other way for a few yuans."
11215,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"I think I catch your drift, Varrick-bear."
11216,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"Ikki! Ikki, where are you? Shoo! Go bother someone else. You two are worse than Kya and Bumi."
11217,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"Okay, everybody here?"
11218,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"Ikki! Oh, thank goodness."
11219,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"Juniper Lightning bug, paws off the table! This is going to be a civilized breakfast. Daddy always says a blessing before we eat, so ... be quiet and listen up! We are thankful for this super yummy food and for being the best-est new friends in the world. But we are most thankful because Meelo and Jinora aren't here, because ''they'' stink. Oh! Hi, Daddy. I guess you found me. Do I have to go now?"
11220,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"Actually, is there room for one more?"
11221,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"Uh, sure. You can sit next to Blueberry Spicehead."
11222,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"Nice to meet you, Blueberry Spicehead."
11223,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"And that's Princess Rainbow, and that's Twinkle Starchild, and that's Juniper Lightning Bug. They're my new brothers and sisters."
11224,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"New ones, huh? Can they be ''my'' new brothers and sisters too?"
11225,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"Maybe, but only if they say it's okay. Uh-huh, uh-huh. No, no, he's nice. They say it's okay."
11226,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"We're good to go. I gave all the money to some guys over there. I told them to ""take care of it"", and then I winked. Pretty sure they got the message."
11227,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Law clerk,This trial will now come to order! Judge Hotah presiding.
11228,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,Man! I should have paid him!
11229,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,"Yeah, you think?"
11230,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,"I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked. They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after Avatar Korra had saved me."
11231,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,"According to Unalaq's testimony, you attended a meeting where Varrick tried to incite a civil war. Is that true?"
11232,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Yes.
11233,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,And where these men present at that meeting?
11234,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"Well, yes, but -"
11235,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,And where exactly did this meeting take place?
11236,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,Objection!
11237,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,Quiet down out there! I'll ask you one more time. Where did the meeting happen?
11238,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,My parents' house.
11239,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,And who led this meeting?
11240,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Your honor, if I may?"
11241,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,May what?
11242,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,May I ... declare a mistrial?
11243,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,"Sit down! Varrick and your father led the meeting, didn't they?"
11244,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,My parents are innocent!
11245,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,I've heard all I need to. I'll return shortly with my decision.
11246,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Hey there, Eska, I was wondering if we could talk."
11247,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Eska,I grant you permission to speak freely.
11248,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you. You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark. But I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading."
11249,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Eska,I agree. It is as if a great chasm has formed between us and nothing can bridge it.
11250,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Oh! Oh, yes! I'm so glad you understand!"
11251,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Eska,"Nothing, that is, except marriage. We will wed at sunset. You may express your joy through tears."
11252,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Oh, no, I can't - This is really tight."
11253,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,"Senna, please step forward. I have found you ... innocent. You are free to go."
11254,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Senna,Korra!
11255,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,"On the charge of treason, you are all found ... guilty. The punishment for this crime ... is death."
11256,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"You can't do this! You take their lives, and I'll take yours!"
11257,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,"Korra, calm down. I'll talk to him. I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider. Show these men and my brother mercy."
11258,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,"Very well. I'll change their punishment. Your lives will be spared, but you will live them out in prison."
11259,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"Thank you, Uncle."
11260,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"You like that, don't you, Blueberry Spicehead? Yes, you do. You know, I could get used to it here. No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional."
11261,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,We should have Uncle Bumi and Aunt Kya come visit. I bet they'd like it too.
11262,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,Let's not. They'll only spoil our good mood.
11263,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"What do you mean? Aunt Kya is super nice and pretty and always asks me how I'm feeling, and Uncle Bumi is, like, the funniest person ''in the world''."
11264,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"But what about Meelo? He's hilarious too, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth. And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle."
11265,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"And mean. And bossy. Being part of a family is hard, huh, Daddy?"
11266,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,I couldn't agree with you more.
11267,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"But, I guess the nice part about a family is they'll always be there for you. Even though Twinkle Starchild and Princess Rainbow fight, they still love each other."
11268,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"That's very wise of you, Ikki."
11269,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"We should probably head back, huh?"
11270,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,I suppose. We can't hide in this cave forever.
11271,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,"Don't worry, Daddy. We'll come back and visit Blueberry Spicehead. I know you really bonded with her."
11272,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,"Yes, I'd like that."
11273,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Senna,"Honey, are you all right?"
11274,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tonraq,I'm fine.
11275,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"Good, let's bust you out of here right now."
11276,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tonraq,"Korra, no. Saving me would start a war. If fighting were to break out, the North would crush the South. I'll be all right. Just promise me you won't do anything rash."
11277,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Fine. I promise.
11278,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"It's okay, Mom."
11279,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Senna,I-I hate feeling so helpless.
11280,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,I know.
11281,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,What do you want?
11282,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,It's not about what ''I'' want. It's about what Naga wants. And she'd like you to let my father out of prison.
11283,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,"I-I'm sorry, but there is nothing I can do. I was just following Unalaq's orders."
11284,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,What are you talking about?
11285,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,I-I've said too much.
11286,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"Unless you wanna be Naga's afternoon snack, you'd better keep talking."
11287,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,I-I've worked for your uncle for years! He said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair.
11288,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,So Unalaq told you what to say?
11289,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,Yes! Every word.
11290,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?
11291,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,He's trying to keep you on his side. But he also wants your father out of the way. Just like when he got your father banished.
11292,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"What do you mean, ""he got my father banished""?"
11293,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Hotah,Nothing!
11294,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Keep talking.
11295,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bumi,"Uh ... Hey there, Dad. You're looking well. Look, uh, I'm sorry I didn't turn out to be an airbender like you hoped. But I've tried my best to keep the world safe. Hope I made you proud."
11296,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Kya,"Of course he'd be proud of you, Bumi."
11297,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bumi,"Kya! I-I was just, uh ... cleaning off Dad's statue. It's so dusty in here."
11298,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Kya,Come here.
11299,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bumi,"Thanks, Kya. You always know when I need a hug."
11300,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!
11301,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,I've been trying to tell you that from the get-go.
11302,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,What happened?
11303,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"I found out the truth about my dad's banishment. Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe. Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them."
11304,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief. It was a setup.
11305,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Just like the whole trial. I can't believe I trusted him. I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail. I need your help.
11306,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,"If you do this, there's no going back."
11307,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,I know. Will you help me or not?
11308,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,"Of course, I'll help."
11309,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,Me too.
11310,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,Count me in!
11311,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,I don't even want to know.
11312,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?
11313,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"No, no, the honesty thing worked out great. So great she decided we should get married!"
11314,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,Sorry.
11315,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,I'm pretty sure the ''guy'' is supposed to give the ''girl'' the betrothal necklace.
11316,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,I guess ''Eska'' didn't get the memo.
11317,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Look, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast. Lucky for you, Varrick's got your back. Now, gather 'round Ping-Ping. Let's talk plan."
11318,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,My dad's in there. Where is he?
11319,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,"I'm sorry, Korra. You'll never see your father again."
11320,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Where's my father?
11321,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,On a ship headed to the Northern Tribe. He'll serve out his sentence there.
11322,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Bring him back. Or I'm taking you out and the rest of your army.
11323,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,"Remember who you are. As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war. You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity."
11324,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"You don't want unity. You want power. You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you? You got him banished so you could become chief, and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father. No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him."
11325,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny.
11326,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"Well, I don't want your help anymore."
11327,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,"If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South. And even I will be powerless to stop them."
11328,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"I'm done being manipulated by you. You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North."
11329,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,And why would I do that?
11330,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Because you still need ''me'' to open the Northern portal.
11331,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Unalaq,"No, I don't. You've served your purpose."
11332,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,"If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father."
11333,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Let's go.
11334,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Northern soldier,You have a license for that animal?
11335,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"Uh, you fellas seen a traveling circus come through here?"
11336,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Zhu Li, do the thing."
11337,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Excited man,That platypus bear is pooping money!
11338,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,Where's your dad?
11339,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,On a ship headed north. Think we can catch up to it?
11340,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Sure, once you get us past our friends from the North."
11341,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,If only we had a plane to get me close to those ships. I could waterbend them out of the way.
11342,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"A plane? Well, why didn't you say so?"
11343,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,"Um, why do you have a plane on your boat?"
11344,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"In case the boat sinks, of course."
11345,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Asami,But there's no runway. How are we supposed to take off?
11346,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Zhu Li! Take a note: ""Build runway""."
11347,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Zhu Li,"Yes, sir."
11348,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,I have an idea.
11349,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Now!
11350,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Helmsman,"Captain, you'll never gonna believe this."
11351,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,There! My dad's on ''that'' ship!
11352,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Jump!
11353,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,Where are the prisoners?
11354,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tonraq,"Korra, this is crazy. You promised me you wouldn't do anything rash."
11355,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Pema,Sweetie! You're okay! Oh! I was so worried! Do you have something you wanna say to your sister?
11356,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Meelo,"Ikki, I'm glad you're back."
11357,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Jinora,"Yeah, sorry we made fun of you."
11358,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Ikki,Thanks. Wanna play airball?
11359,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Jinora,Sure!
11360,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Meelo,Yeah!
11361,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,I wanted to apologize for how I acted yesterday. I've worked so hard to celebrate Dad's legacy that I may have overlooked the parts of him that were less than ideal.
11362,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Kya,And we're sorry for dumping our frustrations with Dad out on you.
11363,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bumi,"Yeah, you didn't deserve that."
11364,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Kya,I thought you two might wanna see this. Mom gave it to me before we left.
11365,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bumi,"That is one good-looking family, huh?"
11366,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tenzin,That's one happy family.
11367,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"So once I knew the truth, I couldn't sit by and do nothing."
11368,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tonraq,My own brother betrayed me. And our entire tribe.
11369,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Rebel leader,What's our next move?
11370,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tonraq,I've been running from my past for too long. It's time to put my brother in his place.
11371,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Rebel leader,"You have our support, ''Chief'' Tonraq."
11372,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,"Mine too. I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad."
11373,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tonraq,"No, Korra."
11374,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,But you said the South doesn't stand a change against Unalaq's forces. I can help.
11375,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tonraq,The best way for you to help is by getting the president of the United Republic on our side. The South can give Unalaq a good fight for a while. But we'll need the United Forces in order to win this war.
11376,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Tonraq,"I love you, too."
11377,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,"I really need to thank you, Korra."
11378,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Korra,For what? I started a civil war.
11379,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,Exactly! Now Eska and I are officially broken up.
11380,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,"Oh, looks like we have company! And not the ''fun'' kind!"
11381,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Mako,What is that?
11382,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Bolin,''That'' would be my darling Eska. Quick question: is this thing fast enough to get away from my crazy waterbending ex-girlfriend?
11383,2,"Civil Wars, Part 2",Spirits,2,77,Varrick,Why do you think I built this boat?
11384,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Shiro Shinobi,"It's brother versus brother in the war of the Water Tribes. After Korra discovered that Chief Unalaq betrayed her and her father, she turned against him, sparking civil war. The Southern rebels rallied around Tonraq, but they are vastly outnumbered, so Korra is headed to Republic City to seek aid. But will she be able to convince President Raiko to send troops to help the South?"
11385,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lin,"Welcome home, Avatar. Thanks for starting a war."
11386,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"I ''didn't'' start a war. Well, I did, but it's more complicated than you're making it seem."
11387,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lin,"Mako, I want you back on the beat. There's going to be a Southern Water Tribe peace march tonight. I need you there to make sure things don't get out of hand."
11388,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,I'm all yours.
11389,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I'll go too. The people of the South need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders.
11390,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lin,"Great, that should calm them down."
11391,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,Maybe you should sit this out.
11392,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,What?
11393,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,I just think having you there blatantly supporting one side will only make things worse. You could at least try to seem neutral.
11394,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I'm not neutral! The North invaded my home. The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South.
11395,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,Zhu Li's already scheduled a meeting for us with President Raiko tomorrow. We'll get them on board.
11396,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Whatever, I gotta go to work."
11397,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Asami,I better go check on my factory.
11398,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I'm going to find out about this peace march.
11399,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,And ''I'' am dying for a pedicure.
11400,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"So, um, what should I be doing?"
11401,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"I don't know, Bolin. Figure something out."
11402,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"Say, kid, have you ever seen Republic City at night?"
11403,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"Sure, I live here."
11404,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,Have you ''really'' seen it?
11405,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,Y- no?
11406,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,That's what I thought. Come on.
11407,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,General,Tonraq and the rebels are holed up here in the hills outside of town.
11408,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Unalaq,Leave them. My brother's no threat to us up there. Increase security around the spirit portal. Keeping it safe is our number one priority.
11409,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,General,"Yes, sir!"
11410,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Unalaq,I need you two to go after the Avatar. She's the only one who can open the Northern spirit portal.
11411,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Desna,"But Father, you told Korra-"
11412,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Unalaq,I told Korra what I thought she needed to hear.
11413,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Eska,''I'll'' find her. She stole my husband.
11414,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Unalaq,I need her ''alive''.
11415,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Eska,Fine.
11416,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,"Watch me, Poki. You lie down and roll over. Roll. Over."
11417,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,"No, no, you can't just demonstrate it. That never works."
11418,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,Good!
11419,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,"Ugh, classic over-rewarding."
11420,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,"Poki, where are you going?"
11421,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,"Command respect. Having some trouble, son?"
11422,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,Poki isn't very good at learning.
11423,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,"Believe me, I know the feeling. Maybe I can help. How would you like your old dad to teach you how to be a master trainer?"
11424,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,Yeah!
11425,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Reporter,"Tensions are running up high outside of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. The Avatar is leading a group of Southerners in a peaceful protest against Chief Unalaq, but the Northerners have come out in droves in support of their leader."
11426,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Northern protesters,Boo! Get out of here! Boo! Get a real job! Get out of here!
11427,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,Hey! Stop! Republic City Police!
11428,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,The Northern Water Tribe is out of control!
11429,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,I saw a firebender running away from the blast. The North might not be responsible for this.
11430,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Of course, they're responsible. Who else would it be?"
11431,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"Wow. Usually, when I see flashing lights like this, it's because I got hit in the head with a rock."
11432,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,Being famous is like getting hit with a rock ''all'' the time.
11433,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Spectator,Look! It's Bolin!
11434,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Shiro Shinobi,"Folks, that cheer you're hearing is for local favorite, Bolin, of the Fire Ferrets. Let's see if we can get a quick interview. Bolin! Bolin, the Fire Ferrets are out for the season. How have you been spending your time lately?"
11435,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"Well, I took a trip South for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war ... But there's nowhere I'd rather be than pro-bending night in Republic City! Am I right, people? Republic City!"
11436,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Shiro Shinobi,Do you miss being in the ring?
11437,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"Look how these people love you, kid! They're eating that cornball spiel right out of your hand."
11438,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"The trick is, whenever I get confused, I just say ""Republic City"" or ""fans"", and then everyone cheers."
11439,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,I think I just figured out your true calling.
11440,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I hope President Raiko listens to us.
11441,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,Don't worry. I was a big contributor to his election campaign. Him and the other guy. Gotta hedge your bets.
11442,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Hello, Mr. President. Sir, the Southern Water Tribe-"
11443,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,Just a second. Keep smiling.
11444,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"Now, how can I help the Avatar and my most ''generous'' supporter?"
11445,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,Unalaq's troops have invaded the South. We need you to send the United Forces to help.
11446,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,I'm very concerned by what's happening down there. But I don't think it's the Republic's place to interfere with internal Water Tribe matters.
11447,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,Unalaq isn't even the rightful ruler of the Water Tribe. He lied his way onto the Northern throne.
11448,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"Mr. President, the Republic is ''already'' involved in this conflict. The North attacked our cultural center last night."
11449,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"Believe me, we are doing everything we can to bring the people responsible to justice."
11450,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"""The people responsible""? Who else would it be but the Northerners?"
11451,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"Now, I know that when you're young, it's hard to keep perspective-"
11452,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"You're the one who's lost perspective. I'm trying to save my tribe, and you're taking pictures."
11453,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"Sending troops is not something I can do at this time. But I promise I will work with Unalaq and the South for a diplomatic solution. Now, I'm sorry, but my mind is made up. This meeting is over."
11454,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"My family is going to be wiped out, and it'll be on ''your'' head for doing ''nothing'' about it."
11455,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I can't believe the President is doing nothing! H-He doesn't even care!
11456,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"I'm sure he cares, but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the South Pole that has nothing to do with them."
11457,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,How could you take ''his'' side?
11458,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,What's with you and sides? Why do you always think I'm working against you?
11459,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Well, you're not ''helping'' me! I'm trying to get troops to the South. What are ''you'' doing?"
11460,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,I'm doing my ''job''.
11461,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Well, ''excuse me'', officer. Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets. I'm just trying to save the world."
11462,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't keep messing it up!"
11463,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I can't talk to you when you're like this.
11464,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,You're the one who's like this!
11465,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Asami,Huh? Hey! In a hurry?
11466,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick."
11467,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Asami,"Yeah, me too."
11468,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"Oh, hello! See? I told you I could do it."
11469,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,Sorry I ever doubted you.
11470,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,We can't wait for the President to act. We need those troops ''now''.
11471,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Asami,And my company is about to go under. I have to find a way to make some sales.
11472,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"Right, okay. Got it. Idea storm! Get the supplies! You're about to get an inside look at how Varrick Global Industries stays at the forefront of imagination innovation, ''or'' ""imagivation""! That's trademarked, pal. Brainwork requires increased circulation. Let's do this! Okay, here come the ideas. Fast and furious. Pink mint lemon tea. Radio for ''pets''. Uh, hand shoes. Hold on a tic. We don't need the President to go to the South. We just need the troops! Let's go straight to them! If there's one thing I know about troops, it's that they love ''fighting''."
11473,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I know General Iroh. He might be willing to help us.
11474,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,A man on the inside. Perfect! And you need to sell some mecha tanks. I know some people who need them. We'll ship 'em South.
11475,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,That's perfect! You'll be making money for your company ''and'' you'll be helping to defeat Unalaq.
11476,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"It's true. If you can't make money during a war, you just flat-out ''cannot'' make money."
11477,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Asami,"It's dangerous on the seas right now, but I'm willing to try if you are."
11478,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I don't understand why it's so hard to get Republic City to support the South.
11479,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"Don't worry, I'm already working on that. As soon as people see ''this'', they'll be lining up to fight Unalaq. Zhu Li, do the, uh-- the thing."
11480,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,Don't freak out. It's not real.
11481,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,I had a film crew documenting the entire Northern invasion.
11482,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,Ahhh! Sorry. I keep doing that.
11483,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"We're gonna cut this footage together with scenes we shoot of our superstar Bolin here playing a Southern Water Tribe hero ''battling'' the evil Unalaq. ''No one'' will root for the North after they see ""The Adventures of Nuktuk: ''Hero'' of the ''South''""!"
11484,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,I'm Nuktuk! What do you think?
11485,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today. That guy is a genius."
11486,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,Uh-huh.
11487,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing."
11488,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,What? That's a terrible idea!
11489,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"And he's gonna put me in the movers as this hero, Nuktuk! He's a man of action, but he's got a heart of gold. He was born in the tundra."
11490,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here."
11491,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"Oh. Oh, sorry. Uh, sure. What is it?"
11492,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,Something doesn't make sense about this bombing. I just don't buy that the Northern Water Tribe was behind it. Wait a second! That's him! That's the guy that attacked the center! I gotta go show this to Beifong!
11493,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,Glad I could help. Nuktuk saves the day again!
11494,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,"All right, Meelo, the first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish ''dominance''. You are in charge. Never forget that. Now call Poki."
11495,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,"Poki, come here! Poki. Poki, no!"
11496,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,Meelo ... you're rewarding him for bad behavior.
11497,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,But he's tickling me.
11498,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,"You can't let him nap in the bed with you. You are the alpha lemur. He has to sleep on the floor. I know it's hard, but it's for the best."
11499,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,"No, Poki, this is my bed. You sleep on the floor. Being alpha lemur is lonely."
11500,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,I know.
11501,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,How did this Cultural Center attack happen right under your nose? And why haven't you arrested the Northerners responsible?
11502,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lin,"We're working on it, sir."
11503,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"Well, work harder! If you don't get any results soon, I'm going to find someone who can."
11504,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,I got a break in the bombing case. I I.D.'d the guy I saw at the scene.
11505,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lu,"That's great, Mako."
11506,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Gang,"Yeah, you better run that in to Beifong right now."
11507,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,You think?
11508,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lu,Sure. You're gonna be a hero!
11509,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lin,What makes a ''rookie'' beat cop think he can interrupt ''my'' meeting with the ''President''?
11510,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"I'm sorry, I just-- um, I found something out about the bombing."
11511,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lin,"Well, give it to Lu and Gang, you moron. Now get out!"
11512,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lu,Sorry. Was she busy?
11513,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions. He's a member of the Agni Kais. Someone must have hired him to make it look like ''Northerners'' attacked the Cultural Center.
11514,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Gang,Hmm.
11515,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,Did you learn anything about that remote control I found at the scene? That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible.
11516,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lu,"Listen, kid, it was the ''Northern'' Water Tribe, okay?"
11517,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Gang,"Yeah, give it a rest, Super Cop."
11518,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,I've heard good things about you. You've made some big triad busts for a rookie.
11519,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Thank you, sir."
11520,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"And you're dating the Avatar, right?"
11521,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Yes, sir."
11522,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"I'm concerned that she might be getting some bad advice from Varrick. You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything that might compromise the security of Republic City, would you, officer? Let me remind you that you've sworn an oath. You're a man of the law before anything else."
11523,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Yes, sir."
11524,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"Well, keep up the good work."
11525,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Wait, there's something you should know."
11526,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Thank you for seeing me, General Iroh."
11527,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Iroh,What can I do?
11528,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"The South needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely, but the President is refusing to give the order. So I decided to come to you directly."
11529,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Iroh,"I see. Well, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some ''routine'' training maneuvers. And let's say we were to ''accidentally'' run into a hostile Northern blockade. We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?"
11530,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I guess you wouldn't. Thank you!
11531,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,Swapping old war stories?
11532,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Iroh,Mr. President.
11533,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,I hope you're not planning to take any military action without an order from your commander-in-chief?
11534,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Iroh,"Of course not, sir."
11535,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"Good. Because if a single vessel leaves this harbor without my say-so, you'll be court-martialed. Am I clear?"
11536,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Iroh,"Crystal, sir."
11537,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Raiko,"Your activities here are bordering on insurrection. The Avatar does not command the military of the Republic. ''Don't'' go behind my back again. As you were, General Iroh."
11538,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I ''hate'' that guy!
11539,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Iroh,I'm sorry. My hands are officially tied.
11540,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,I understand. Thanks anyway.
11541,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Iroh,"But you should talk to the Fire Lord. My mother and grandfather have ''always'' been good friends with the Avatar, and the Southern Water Tribe. I'm sure they'll be willing to help."
11542,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Thank you, General."
11543,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,Wouldn't I be ''cold'' wearing this outfit in the snow?
11544,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"Ah, Nuktuk is ''never'' cold."
11545,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,"Ohhh. Hey, Ginger."
11546,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,"How about that, huh? It's the latest product in my Varri-manageable Hair Line: Varri-dye! We get some shots of her using it before Unalaq kidnaps her, I ''guarantee'' we sell a million cases week one."
11547,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Bolin, I need you to watch Naga while I'm gone."
11548,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,Where are you going?
11549,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,The Fire Nation. I'm going to try to get them to help the South. I need a boat.
11550,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Varrick,What happened with General Iroh?
11551,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"He was going to help, but then President Raiko showed up. Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't figure it out. No one knew about it except for us and Asami."
11552,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,And Mako.
11553,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,Mako?
11554,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Bolin,What? There's no way Mako would have told. Right?
11555,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,"Poki, sit! Roll over. Good boy."
11556,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,"Well done, Meelo! I knew you could learn to train Poki."
11557,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,Not just Poki. I trained ''all'' the lemurs. Watch!
11558,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Tenzin,"I've created a monster. Uh, maybe we should forget about all this training discipline for now. Why don't you and Poki just have fun and play?"
11559,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Meelo,"Thanks, dad, training makes me tired. Come on, Poki."
11560,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,You ratted me out to the President?
11561,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Korra, let me explain."
11562,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,Explain why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?
11563,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Look, the President of the Republic asked me a direct question. What was I supposed to do?"
11564,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"You betrayed me, and my family!"
11565,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Enough! Look, I have a job to do! I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another ''huge'' mistake!"
11566,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"Well, I ''have'' a job to do too, only it seems like ''you're'' always standing in the way of me getting it ''done''!"
11567,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,"Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our ''relationship''!"
11568,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Korra,"So, what? Are you breaking up with me?"
11569,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,Yeah. I guess I am.
11570,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lin,What the flameo happened here?!
11571,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Mako,I broke up with the Avatar.
11572,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Lin,You got off easy. You shoulda seen Air Temple Island after Tenzin broke up with me!
11573,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Eska,You ruined my wedding!
11574,2,Peacekeepers,Spirits,2,78,Eska,No one steals my Bolin!
11575,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Shiro Shinobi,"Someone has attacked the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. All the evidence points to Northern sympathizers, but Mako suspects there's more to this case. Meanwhile, Varrick has cast Bolin as the hero of his newest mover. Asami has also ventured into business with Varrick, and a shipment of her mecha tanks is on its way to help the South in its war against Unalaq."
11576,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Captain,We're under attack!
11577,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Captain,Varrick is not gonna be happy about this.
11578,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Eska,Where is he?
11579,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Desna,Father said he would meet us at this location. He'll be here. Were you just in the Spirit World?
11580,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Unalaq,Never mind that. Where is the Avatar?
11581,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Eska,She was within our grasp until a dark spirit attacked her.
11582,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Desna,They're ''out'' of control.
11583,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Unalaq,You didn't get her?
11584,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Eska,The Avatar is dead.
11585,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Nuktuk,"We finally made it. Now, we must stop the evil Unalaq!"
11586,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Evil Unalaq,"The Southern Water Tribe is mine. Next, I will conquer the world with my waterbending doomsday device!"
11587,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Nuktuk,"Don't worry, Juji and Roh-Tan, I will end the evil Unalaq's reign of terror. For I am Nuktuk, ''hero'' of the ''South''!"
11588,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Juji,"Nuktuk, you're not just the hero of the South, you're our best friend."
11589,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Nuktuk,You two are the best snow raccoon and arctic panda a guy could ask for.
11590,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Crowd,Aww!
11591,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"Bolin, look up there. What do you see?"
11592,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,I- is this a trick question?
11593,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"I'll tell you what I see: a ''star'' being born. You're a star. People love stars. Stars tell them what to think and how to act. Bolin, have you ever tried to force a monkey marmot to ride a bicycle?"
11594,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,Uh ... not that I can recall.
11595,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,Of course you haven't. You can't ''force'' monkey marmots to do anything. They've got to want to do it themselves!
11596,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,Right ...
11597,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"With these movers, we'll have the support of the people, and before long, they'll persuade the President to lend his troops to the war effort."
11598,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Evil Unalaq,My evil plan is working. I've captured Nuktuk's beautiful girlfriend.
11599,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Nuktuk,"Not so fast, Evil Unalaq! Oh, I ''will'' save my true love ''and the South''! And now, your time is up."
11600,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Evil Unalaq,"It's no use fighting, Nuktuk. My anti-energy net makes bending impossible."
11601,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Nuktuk,No! Please. Power ... weakening.
11602,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Voice narrator,Will this be the end of Nuktuk? Can he escape from Unalaq's trap and save the beautiful Ginger? Find out next week on ''The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South''.
11603,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,Wow. We got some major chemistry on-screen. Am I right?
11604,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Ginger,Yeah. ''On''-screen.
11605,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"What's wrong? Are you mad because I left you in the clutches of the evil Unalaq? I'm gonna save you in the next episode. Ginger, let's work through this."
11606,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Zhu Li,"Varrick, another one of your ships has been captured."
11607,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"Darn it, Zhu Li, haven't I told you I ''hate'' getting bad news without first getting ''good'' news?"
11608,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Zhu Li,"Oh, well, the good news is it looks like your first mover has gotten a great reception."
11609,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,That's ''old'' news! Let's go.
11610,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Is it true?
11611,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,I'm so sorry. Your entire shipment was stolen.
11612,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"Without that sale, I don't know how much longer I can keep my company going. What am I gonna do?"
11613,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Don't worry. I'm gonna find whoever's responsible. Chief Beifong is about to question the captain of the ship.
11614,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lin,"I know it's been a long day, but walk me through what happened."
11615,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Captain,We were ambushed about thirty klicks outside the harbor. We never heard them coming.
11616,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lin,This is the third attack this week at about the same location.
11617,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lu,"Yep, and smack-dab in Republic City's jurisdiction, which means another problem for us. All this stress is gonna turn old black beauty gray."
11618,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Gang,It's gotta be Northern Water Tribe. They're trying to stop supply lines to the South.
11619,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lin,I agree. Is there anything else about the attack you remember? Anything unusual?
11620,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Captain,There is one thing. The bombs exploded in a way I've never seen before. They didn't have fuses. It was like they were being detonated remotely.
11621,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Like the bombs at the cultural center.
11622,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"Wait, where are you going?"
11623,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,I gotta grab some evidence.
11624,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"Asami, I heard the news. I can't ''believe'' they took my fifth favorite ship in the Varrick Industries fleet! Named her after my mom. Rest in piece, Rocky Bottom."
11625,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"Without the money from that shipment, Future Industries is almost broke."
11626,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Chief, I think there's a link between this attack and the attack at the cultural center."
11627,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lin,What do you think you're doing?
11628,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Solving this case. Did any of the people who attacked you have one of these in their hand? I think it's a remote detonator.
11629,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Captain,It was too dark to see anything.
11630,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lin,Mako!
11631,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Chief, I don't think the people who attacked were Northern Water Tribe."
11632,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Gang,Of course they were Northern Water Tribe. They were waterbending.
11633,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Was this one of the guys who attacked?
11634,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Captain,"No, I don't recognize him."
11635,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Gang,"Oh, that's embarrassing."
11636,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lu,"Nice try, Rookie."
11637,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lin,"Mako, leave. Now."
11638,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"Great work, everybody. Another open and shut case for the dynamic mustachioed duo!"
11639,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"Wait, I think Mako might be onto something."
11640,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Chief, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys."
11641,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lu,"Yeah, let's all listen to the rookie."
11642,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,He's doing a better job than you!
11643,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,Whooooo's hungry?
11644,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Lin,"Enough! I don't want to hear your lame-brained rookie ideas. You're a beat cop, not a detective. Now hit the street and do your job!"
11645,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Lu and Gang are idiots. I hate them and their stupid mustaches.
11646,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Forget them. What's this idea of yours?
11647,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"A sting operation. I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it."
11648,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Let's do it.
11649,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"It's not that easy. For the plan to work, we need the police, and Beifong already said no."
11650,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"We can make it work, just the two of us."
11651,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"I don't know. I don't want to go behind Beifong's back. If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force."
11652,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"Mako, I need your help. My Mom is gone. My Dad is in jail. Future Industries is all I have left of my family."
11653,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job. First of all, we'd need a ship."
11654,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,You need a ship? I got a ship. I want in on whatever you're talking about. I love being in on plans.
11655,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"The less you know, the better."
11656,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,Perfect! I love not knowing things.
11657,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"All right, I'm in. Let's get these guys."
11658,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,The ship's all loaded with the dummy crates. Let's get this sting operation going.
11659,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Not yet. We need some extra manpower.
11660,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,What about Korra? No better muscle than the Avatar.
11661,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Right, uh ... Korra. Yeah, actually, she's um ... she's out of town right now."
11662,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Everything okay with you two?
11663,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Yeah, yeah. Forget about Korra. I'll go talk to Bolin."
11664,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"Hey, Mako, what do you think? I did a little redecorating. It turns out that one of the perks of being a star, you get lots of cash."
11665,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Is this a marble statue of you?
11666,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,It's also a hat rack.
11667,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,We don't even have hats.
11668,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"That's because we never ''had'' a hat rack. And now we do. Mako, you seem stressed. I think ''you'' need to take a little dipity dip."
11669,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"I don't have time to take a dipity dip, okay? I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help."
11670,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,You need my help? I don't know. I'm kinda busy.
11671,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,You're sitting in a hot tub.
11672,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"I'm maintaining my instrument. As an actor, my ''body'' is my instrument."
11673,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Are you gonna help or not?
11674,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life."
11675,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,So that's a no. What am I supposed to do now?
11676,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"I don't know, Mako. Figure it out. Remember? That's what you said to me. Hurts, doesn't it? Ow! My instrument!"
11677,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Are you sure this is a good idea?
11678,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"No, but it's our last resort."
11679,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Triple Threat doorman,"Hey, Mako. Whatever you think we did, we didn't do it."
11680,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"I'm not here on police business. I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action."
11681,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Triple Threat doorman,How big a piece?
11682,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,"So Mr. Law and Order needs our help, huh? What's in it for the Triple Threats?"
11683,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,I am personal friends with that Avatar. I ''might'' be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back.
11684,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Shady Shin,"Sounds good to me, boss."
11685,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,What about the rest of us?
11686,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"I've got vehicles, all brand-new and top of the line. They can be yours if you help."
11687,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,I think we got ourselves a deal.
11688,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"This is right around the area where the attacks happened. So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet."
11689,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,"I agree. Keep quiet. Mouth zipped, don't say a word. That's the best thing to do when you're trying to ambush somebody, which is what we're doing here, and it's basically what I'm always doing. I mean, I ''am'' a gangster, after all, and -"
11690,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Two Toed Ping, please."
11691,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,"Oh, right. So, what's it like dating the Avatar. Come on, Mako, I gotta know."
11692,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Ping, stay focused!"
11693,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,"What? What are you so weird about it? If I was dating the Avatar, I'd tell ''you'' all about it."
11694,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,There's nothing to know. I broke up with her.
11695,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,You broke up? When? Why didn't you tell me?
11696,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,I don't know.
11697,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,"Yeah, right. ''You'' broke up with the Avatar. Like that happened. Hey, Shady Shin, Viper. Mako says he broke up with the Avatar."
11698,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Shady Shin,''Sure'' he did.
11699,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,"Yeah, I did too."
11700,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?"
11701,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Assistant director,And action!
11702,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Ginger,Forget about me. You ''must'' capture the evil Unalaq before he gets away.
11703,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Nuktuk,No! I'll never leave you.
11704,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,Cut! There's no kiss in the script.
11705,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment. It just felts so right."
11706,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Ginger,Urch.
11707,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"It did, huh? Your girlfriend's about to die, and instead of untying her, you ''kiss'' her. Wait a minute! Maybe that will work. Yes! It's genius! Everybody take five. Except for you, Zhu Li. Grab the tweezers. I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve."
11708,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,So ... that kiss. I liked it. And it seemed like you liked it too.
11709,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Ginger,Uch. You're confusing Ginger the actress with Ginger the character.
11710,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now. It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not."
11711,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Ginger,"That's because Ginger loves Nuktuk, not Bolin."
11712,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,But Nuktuk ''is'' Bolin. I'm a hero.
11713,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,And that's why they call me Two Toed Ping.
11714,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Because you have two ''extra'' toes.
11715,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,That's right. And there was already a Twelve Toed Ping on the south side.
11716,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Wait, guys. Do you hear that?"
11717,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,I didn't hear anything.
11718,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,No.
11719,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Ah! What's taking so long?
11720,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,"You just gotta relax, like me. Maybe try taking your shoes off."
11721,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,I'm gonna check it out.
11722,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Shady Shin,So how long do we have to stay out here?
11723,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,"I told you, it's gonna be a few hours. What, do you have a hot date?"
11724,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Shady Shin,"Actually, I do. And I wanna look my best. I gotta shower and shave. I have a whole routine, okay?"
11725,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,"Well, your date's gonna have to wait."
11726,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Shady Shin,She's not gonna be happy about that.
11727,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,"Too bad. We were paid to keep Mako and that dame distracted for a few hours, so that's what we're gonna do."
11728,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Shady Shin,See? This is why I never get dates.
11729,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper. We've been double-crossed. We have to get off this ship.
11730,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,Where do you think you're going?
11731,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Viper,Get'm!
11732,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,They're getting closer.
11733,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Not for long.
11734,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Watch out! We're not gonna make it. One down, one to go."
11735,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,We're stalled.
11736,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"Mako, hang onto something. What was that all about?"
11737,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted.
11738,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Distracted? From what? Oh no.
11739,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Whoever paid the Triple Threats stole everything.
11740,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,I'm ruined. My company ... it's over.
11741,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,We should check out your other warehouses. Maybe they didn't have time to hit them all.
11742,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,You don't understand. Everything I had was in here.
11743,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,We have to search the place for evidence. If we can find a lead ...
11744,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Mako ... it doesn't matter anymore.
11745,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,I can figure this out.
11746,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,Just stop. It's over. I give up.
11747,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Well, I'm not giving up on you."
11748,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"Sorry, I-"
11749,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Uh ... It's-it's okay. Um ... Anyway ... I gotta run. I'm gonna find out who did this. And I know just who to ask.
11750,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,"Hey, Mako. Uh, you're not mad about last night, are you?"
11751,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Who hired you to double-cross us?
11752,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,I don't know.
11753,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"I think you do know. And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to ""No Toed Ping""."
11754,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,"Really, I don't know. You have to believe me. We never met the guy who hired us."
11755,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,You expect me to believe that?
11756,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Two Toed Ping,"After you left the hideout, some mook showed up and said his boss would pay us to keep you distracted. We'd never seen him before, and we ain't seen him since. Come on, Mako, you know how these deals work. Please, I would never lie to you with my lucky toes on the line."
11757,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Get out of here.
11758,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Bolin, have you seen Varrick around? Bolin! Nuktuk."
11759,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"Yes? Oh, hello, Mako. Didn't notice you there."
11760,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Where's Varrick? I need to ask him something.
11761,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him. But I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene. There's gonna be some crazy ""pyrotechnics"". That's mover speak for explosions."
11762,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Assistant director,We need Nuktuk on set. Running explosion scene.
11763,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Bolin,"Or sometimes we just call them explosions. Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene."
11764,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Assistant director,"Okay, the set is clear. Camera's rolling. And ... action!"
11765,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Nuktuk,"Ginger, stay down! I'm coming for you."
11766,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,How did you rig those explosions to go off like that?
11767,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Pyrotechnics technician,"Neat, huh? It's a Varrick Industries exclusive. Here, check it out. The explosions use a remote detonator."
11768,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,Varrick.
11769,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Asami, I think I know who set us up."
11770,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"Hello, Mako."
11771,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,What are you doing here?
11772,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,He just saved my company. Varrick bought a controlling interest in Future Industries. Isn't that great?
11773,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Varrick,"Yep, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy. Especially if that little guy can help ''this'' guy become a ''bigger'' guy."
11774,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Asami,"So what were you saying, Mako? You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?"
11775,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Mako,"Yeah, and I'm ''real'' close to proving it. I'll fill you in later."
11776,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Korra,Get away from me!
11777,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Karu,"It's okay, we're here to help you, Avatar Korra."
11778,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Korra,"Who's-who's ""Avatar Korra""?"
11779,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Karu,What happened to you? How did you end up on our island?
11780,2,The Sting,Spirits,2,79,Korra,I ... don't know. I can't remember anything.
11781,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Shiro Shinobi,"The Avatar has gone missing. After President Raiko refused Korra's request to aid the South in the war of the Water Tribes, she headed to the Fire Nation, seeking a new ally against Unalaq. But unbeknownst to her friends, a dark spirit attacked Korra and dragged her into the ocean. She has washed up on a desolate island with no memory of who she is."
11782,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Female Sage,"We found the Avatar washed up onshore, but she doesn't remember anything."
11783,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Korra,Raava. Raava. Raava.
11784,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Shaman,A dark energy has infected her. We must purge it before it destroys her Avatar Spirit. Let the waters cleanse the darkness that plagues your spirit.
11785,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Korra,Who are you?
11786,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Korra's image,I am you.
11787,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Korra,Who am I?
11788,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Aang's image,You are the Avatar.
11789,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Korra,I don't know what that is.
11790,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Roku's image,"In order to remember, you must regain your connection with your Avatar Spirit."
11791,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Kyoshi's image,"If you don't, darkness will engulf the world. You will die, and our era will end."
11792,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Korra,How do I regain my connection?
11793,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Kuruk's image,Go back. Return to the beginning. Find Raava.
11794,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Korra,Are you Raava?
11795,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan's image,"No, but I can help you find her. My name is Wan, and I will show you how I became the first Avatar."
11796,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Little Chou,Nobody steals from the Chou brothers!
11797,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Really? Because I just did.
11798,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Big Chou,"You're dead, Wan."
11799,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Actually, I feel quite alive."
11800,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Little Chou,"Hey, stop!"
11801,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"He-he-hey, fellas! You're just in time for lunch!"
11802,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Little Chou,I told you no one steals from us.
11803,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,Did you steal from the Chous again?
11804,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Yeah, and I got to nothing show for it except a few dirty rolls and a whole lot of bruises. Hey, Yao, I got some food for you."
11805,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Yao,"Mmm. Delicious! Thank you, Wan."
11806,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"You guys are hungry too, huh?"
11807,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,"Wan, you should eat."
11808,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"They need it more than I do. Besides, I'm tired of eating scraps. If only there was some way to get into the Chous' food cellar. We'd be eating like, well, like Chous."
11809,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,"If Chou the Elder catches you sneaking into his palace, you'll end up dead. Or worse, he'll banish you to the Spirit Wilds."
11810,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Yao,"No, don't get banished. You don't want nothing to do with those spirits. They'll get inside ya, scramble up your mind, turn you into this , a monster!"
11811,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,"Don't do anything crazy, Wan. You just gotta accept the world is the way it is. Some people have power. Some people don't. And you don't."
11812,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Not yet, anyway."
11813,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,Are you strong? Are you fearless? Do you have what it takes to battle the spirits? Then join the hunt.
11814,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Count me in.
11815,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,We're going to be out in the wilds for a week. You wouldn't last two seconds.
11816,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"I can handle myself. We all get fire, right?"
11817,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"Yeah, but do you know how to use it?"
11818,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Well, not exactly, but I-"
11819,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,All right. Welcome to the hunt.
11820,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,The lion turtle.
11821,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"Great guardian of our city, we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds to bring back food for our people. Please, grant us the power of fire."
11822,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Lion turtle,The power is yours to keep until your return.
11823,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"You're first, kid."
11824,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Lion turtle,May the element of fire protect you against the spirits.
11825,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"Just make sure you aim at the spirits, not us, okay?"
11826,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Sure thing.
11827,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"Everyone, stay close. Spirits love to pick off stragglers."
11828,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Uh, guys? I don't think I can do this."
11829,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"Now, quit your whining. We haven't even seen a spirit yet."
11830,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,I think I wanna go home.
11831,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"I knew you were nothing but a sniveling coward. Go give your fire back to the lion turtle, and don't ever show your face around me again."
11832,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,"Wan, you're back."
11833,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Yao,What goodies did you snatch for us this time?
11834,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,What did you do? You can't steal from the lion turtle.
11835,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Really? Because I just did.
11836,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,"You know it's forbidden to bring the power of the element into the city. Please, go back to the lion turtle and return the fire."
11837,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Jaya, it's time to stop being so afraid of the Chous and show them we have the power to change things."
11838,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Hey, Chous! Open the gate, and let us in."
11839,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Chou the Elder,What are those filthy peasants doing here?
11840,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Big Chou,Don't worry father. We'll take care of them.
11841,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Hand over all the food you're hoarding, and we won't give you any trouble."
11842,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Big Chou,You're not getting past us. We have the weapons. You're powerless.
11843,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Follow me!
11844,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Grab as much food as you can.
11845,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Palace guard,Stop right there!
11846,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,Looks like the Chous found backup.
11847,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Get everyone out of here. I'll hold them off.
11848,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Little Chou,"No, please! Have mercy!"
11849,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Little Chou,Wan?
11850,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Little Chou,"Even when you have the power, you're afraid to use it."
11851,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Chou the Elder,"Tell me who else was involved in the rebellion, and I might take mercy on you."
11852,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Chou the Elder,"Then, you've left me no choice. Wan, you are hereby banished."
11853,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Little Chou,Yeah! And give back the fire you stole.
11854,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"No! Wait. Great lion turtle, I am sorry for stealing the fire from you, and I accept my punishment. But please, I need to be able to protect myself in the wilds."
11855,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Lion turtle,Never again may you return to this city. But I will allow you to keep the power of the element.
11856,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Yao,Bet he doesn't last till morning.
11857,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Frog spirit,"Hey, watch where you're stepping, human!"
11858,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Who said that?
11859,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Frog spirit,Down here! How'd you like it if I started walking all over you?
11860,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,You're just a little frog.
11861,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Frog spirit,Who's little now?
11862,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Please, help me. I'm starving and I haven't slept all night."
11863,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Let me pass.
11864,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"I am Bushy, the Bush Spirit. And I would like the enter your oasis."
11865,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Come on, let me in, just for a little while."
11866,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Believe me, I'd love to go back home. But I can't. I was kicked out."
11867,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Who are you calling ugly, Ugly?"
11868,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,What? There are other lion turtles?
11869,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,So which way to the nearest lion turtle city?
11870,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Real funny. You know what? I don't need your help. I'll find it myself.
11871,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,It's okay. I'm gonna get you out of there.
11872,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"Finally, we caught something. Get it down."
11873,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Back off.
11874,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,Wan? What are you doing here?
11875,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,I'm saving this animal.
11876,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"That animal's our dinner. Now, get out of the way."
11877,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,No!
11878,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, Wan."
11879,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"No, no!"
11880,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,I feel great. What's in this water?
11881,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Thanks for saving my neck. But why'd you do it?
11882,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Told you I wasn't like the others.
11883,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,I was. But I think I've had enough of humans for a while. I've decided to stay here and learn the ways of the spirits.
11884,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"First time for everything, right?"
11885,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,The name is Wan.
11886,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"Gone. Spirits took them. They were protecting that kid, Wan, like he was one of their own."
11887,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,Did you hear that? Wan's still alive.
11888,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Huntsman,"And the way Wan moves fire, it's like nothing I've ever seen. He uses it like it's an extension of his body."
11889,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Jaya,"Wan has proved that with the power of fire, anyone can survive in the wilds. We don't have to live under Chou the Elder's rules anymore, so I say we leave this city and start over. Who's with me?"
11890,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"You ready to go, Mula?"
11891,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Yes. It's time I see the rest of the world and find the other lion turtle cities.
11892,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Stop, or you'll destroy everything!"
11893,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Raava,"This doesn't concern you, human!"
11894,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,It does when the lives of spirits and animals are in danger.
11895,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Vaatu,"If you're a friend to spirits, then use your fire to help me break free."
11896,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Raava,Don't involve the human. This is between us.
11897,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Vaatu,"Please, save me. She has tormented me for ten thousand years."
11898,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Ten thousand years? Let him go!
11899,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Vaatu,"Thank you, human. You have performed a great service for the spirits."
11900,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"Yeah, I helped a spirit who was being bullied by you."
11901,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Raava,You are gravely mistaken. I was keeping him under control.
11902,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,And what gives you the right?
11903,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Raava,"You don't even know who I am, do you?"
11904,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,Should I?
11905,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Wan,"So, by freeing Vaatu, I let chaos into the world?"
11906,2,"Beginnings, Part 1",Spirits,2,80,Korra,Raava. I found you.
11907,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Shiro Shinobi,"Avatar Korra has lost her memory! In order to restore it, she has connected with Wan, who would become the very first Avatar. Banished from his home, Wan survived for two years in the Spirit Wilds and learned to master fire. But then, Wan split the spirits of light and dark, Raava and Vaatu, unwittingly plunging the world toward annihilation. Will he be able to stop him?"
11908,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Karu,Should we pull her up?
11909,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"This world is home to all of us, and what happens here is everyone's business."
11910,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Let me help you.
11911,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"I don't want your help. Don't interfere with me again, human!"
11912,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Let's get moving.
11913,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Nomad,"Where did you come from, stranger?"
11914,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Another lion turtle city far away. For the past two years I've been living among the spirits and exploring the wilds.
11915,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Nomad,Remarkable. Come. Sit with us. We would love to hear of your travels.
11916,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Vaatu.
11917,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,"So, we meet again, human."
11918,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Nomad,Why is the great spirit of the darkness here but not his other half?
11919,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"Uh, I'll explain later. Leave these people in peace. They've done nothing to harm you."
11920,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,Be gone.
11921,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,"How are you feeling since our split, Raava? I've never been better. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will destroy you forever."
11922,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,I told you not to interfere.
11923,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,I had to do something. These people were in danger.
11924,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Nomad,"Great spirit of light, we thank you for your help. But how did you become split from Vaatu?"
11925,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,Ask him.
11926,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,It wasn't my fault. Vaatu tricked me into freeing him. I'd take it all back if I could.
11927,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"It's too late for that. Now that Vaatu is free, he is turning other spirits dark. The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes."
11928,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"He's getting bigger, and you're getting smaller."
11929,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"As darkness grows, light fades."
11930,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"I'm sorry for endangering your village, but I promise to set things right."
11931,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Nomad,How?
11932,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"Great lion turtle, I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late."
11933,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Air lion turtle,You already carry the power of fire. No human has ever held two elements at the same time.
11934,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,I'm not like other humans. I can learn to do it.
11935,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Air lion turtle,"Hmm, perhaps. But to do so, Raava must hold the power for you until you master it."
11936,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"Ancient one, why would I do that for a human? Especially one who's caused so much trouble?"
11937,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake. Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance."
11938,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,You may be right. Very well. I will help you to master the power of air.
11939,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Thank you. And in return I will help you restore balance to the world.
11940,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,What's this harmonic thing Vaatu was talking about?
11941,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,Harmonic Convergence. That is when Vaatu and I must battle for the fate of the world.
11942,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,How long do we have until then?
11943,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,About a year in your time.
11944,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"Then we better start training. All right, I'm ready to try air. How's this gonna work?"
11945,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,The only way for me to give you the other element is to pass through your body and combine our energies.
11946,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Great. So you've done this before.
11947,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,No. This has never even been attempted. It is very dangerous.
11948,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"That's what they said about living in the Spirit Wilds, and I survived that. I'm ready. Give me the air. It feels completely different. If you and Vaatu have the same fight every ten thousand years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?"
11949,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other. Even if I defeat Vaatu in this encounter, darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again. The same will hold true if Vaatu defeats me."
11950,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"That doesn't sound so bad. Even if Vaatu wins, you'll come back."
11951,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it. Vaatu will destroy the world as you know it. Darkness will cover the Earth for ten thousand years."
11952,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"This physical world is where humans come from. Spirits come from another realm. At the north and south poles, the two realms intersect. Over time, more and more spirits have drifted into this world. Humans have been forced apart, settling on the lion turtles who protect them and losing touch with each other."
11953,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"Most humans think only of themselves, no matter how many others are around."
11954,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"When you pass through me, I feel an incredible rush of power. I feel like I'm changing. The more we practice, the stronger I become. Smells like smoke."
11955,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,Humans are nearby.
11956,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Let's check it out.
11957,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Settler,A spirit!
11958,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"Easy there, fellas. We're friendly."
11959,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,I can't believe it. Wan?
11960,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Jaya! What are you doing out here?
11961,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,"You inspired us. Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too."
11962,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Where's Yao? Did he come with you?
11963,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,"Yes, but sadly he didn't make it. We ... we lost a lot of good men along the way. So why were you protecting this spirit?"
11964,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,This is Raava. Don't worry. She's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into.
11965,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,Dark spirits? What's the difference? We throw fire at any spirit we see around here. Just like they attack any man.
11966,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,You have no idea what you're doing. You're only making things worse.
11967,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Settler,The spirits are coming back!
11968,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,Let's wipe 'em out this time! We'll burn down this whole forest if we have to!
11969,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,What happened to you? When did you become so violent?
11970,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,You showed me we could change the world if we just stopped being so afraid. Now we're doing it.
11971,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,This isn't what I had in mind.
11972,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Wait! We can resolve this peacefully.
11973,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,It's good to see you again.
11974,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,You are the one who's getting cleared out.
11975,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,There's no need for violence. I know there must be a way to work out a compromise.
11976,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,Spirits like him killed our friends! I can't let them get away with that.
11977,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"It's Vaatu. He's growing stronger, using their anger to turn them to his side."
11978,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"Stop, please! Raava, we need to combine our energies. Maybe then we'll have enough power to stop this. Enough! You need to stop fighting now, before you destroy each other!"
11979,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Jaya,He's controlling all four elements.
11980,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"Wan, I have to leave your body, or I'll destroy you."
11981,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"No. It's working. If you leave, the fighting will start again."
11982,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,Wan!
11983,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,We have to go back.
11984,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,Don't bother. Your human friends have already been annihilated.
11985,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,No!
11986,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,Enjoy your final days. See you at the end of the world!
11987,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Raava ...
11988,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"I'm sorry, Wan."
11989,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"We're almost there. I was wrong about you, Wan. I had no idea that humans were capable of such nobility and courage. I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together."
11990,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"Let's not give up before the battle's even begun. Who knows what will happen? After all, this is my first Harmonic Convergence."
11991,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"This is the southern portal to the Spirit World. Here, Vaatu and I will do battle once again, at the place where the two worlds meet."
11992,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,"Are you ready for our final battle, Raava? Thanks to our friend separating us, I think this time I may be rid of you once and for all."
11993,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me."
11994,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,No human can stand against ''me''.
11995,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Haven't you heard the legends? I'm not a regular human anymore.
11996,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,I lived ten thousand lifetimes before the first of your kind crawled out of the mud!
11997,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,It was I who broke through the divide that separated the plane of spirits from the material world! To hate me is to give me breath. To fight me is to give me strength. Now prepare to face oblivion!
11998,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,Raava! The only way to win is together. Ah!
11999,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,"I have to leave you. If I stay any longer, you will die."
12000,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,"It doesn't matter. If you leave me now, Vaatu will destroy everything. We have to finish this together!"
12001,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Vaatu,The Harmonic Convergence is about to begin. The era of Raava is over.
12002,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,We are bonded forever.
12003,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,This is your prison now. And I will close the portals so no human will ever be able to physically enter the Spirit World and release you.
12004,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,The spirits must stop fighting with humans and return to their home in the Spirit World. I will teach men to respect the spirits so that balance will be maintained.
12005,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Wan,I will be the bridge between our two worlds.
12006,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Fire lion turtle,The world is entering a new age. Our time protecting mankind is over. We will no longer give humans the power of the elements.
12007,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Old Wan,"I'm sorry, Raava. I failed to bring peace. Even with Vaatu locked away, darkness still surrounds humanity. There wasn't enough time."
12008,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Raava,Don't worry. We will be together for all of your lifetimes. And we will never give up.
12009,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Korra,I remember.
12010,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Shaman,Do you know who you are?
12011,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Korra,My name is Korra. I'm the Avatar.
12012,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Shaman,We've been raising this herd of air bison since the Hundred Year War. I never thought I'd be able to present one to the Avatar.
12013,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Korra,Thank you for all your kindness. I wonder how long I've been away.
12014,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Shaman,"That I cannot say, but you do not have much time left. The Harmonic Convergence is only weeks away."
12015,2,"Beginnings, Part 2",Spirits,2,81,Korra,I have to close the spirit portal before that happens.
12016,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Shiro Shinobi,"Korra has regained her memory. By connecting with the original Avatar, Korra learned that to stop Unalaq she must close the spirit portal before Harmonic Convergence, which is only weeks away! Meanwhile, Varrick has made Bolin into a mover star and saved Asami's company. Mako is the only one who suspects that Varrick is up to no good, but can he prove it?"
12017,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"Gotcha! Furry-Foot, come back."
12018,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"Jinora, there you are. Come on, everyone's waiting. Were you playing with someone?"
12019,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"Oh, just some ... imaginary friends."
12020,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,Stop telling lies.
12021,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,It's true. I once beat an earthbender in a rock-throwing contest! I have the trophy to prove it.
12022,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"All right, who's ready for an exciting tour of the Eastern Air Temple? We've got a lot to see today, including ancient statues, ancient gardens, and the meditation hall used by ancient airbenders."
12023,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Ikki,Yay. Old things.
12024,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,Korra?
12025,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Pema,What are you doing here?
12026,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Ikki,"Oh, I've missed you!"
12027,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,And how did you know where to find us?
12028,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,Tenzin's itinerary. We went over it like a hundred times before we left Republic City.
12029,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,See? This is why schedules are important.
12030,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,It's so great to see you all again.
12031,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"It's great to see you too, but why aren't you training at the South Pole?"
12032,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"Wait, you don't know about the Civil War?"
12033,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,What? No. We've been out of touch with the outside world since we started our vacation.
12034,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,Tenzin's idea. What happened?
12035,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,So much. I-I don't know where to start.
12036,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,Just tell us everything!
12037,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"Everything? Okay. I opened a spirit portal at the South Pole, but then Unalaq turned out to be a bad guy and wanted to take control of the South, so I sort of started a Civil War, but when I went to find some help, I was attacked by my cousins, and then by a giant dark spirit, and then I forgot who I was, and then I met the first Avatar, and then I realized I shouldn't have opened the portal in the first place, and now I need to close it again!"
12038,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,I knew this would happen. So Avatar Wan imprisoned this dark spirit Vaatu in the Spirit World?
12039,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"Yes, and now I think my uncle is trying to free him."
12040,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"I knew Unalaq was hungry for power, but never realized how far he would go to get it."
12041,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,This is all my fault.
12042,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"No, don't blame yourself. This is Unalaq's doing. Now, we must focus on setting things right before he can do any more damage."
12043,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,Thank you.
12044,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"So, you need to close the Southern portal, but if Unalaq's army controls the South, how are we going to get to it?"
12045,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,I thought about that. My best chance to close the portal is from the inside. I have to enter the Spirit World.
12046,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"A journey to the Spirit World. All my years of spiritual training have prepared me for this moment. I will help you. Today, we enter the Spirit World."
12047,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Desna,"Father, what are we doing here?"
12048,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the Avatar.
12049,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Desna,"I told you, it wasn't our fault."
12050,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,You're right. It was my fault for trusting you. Harmonic Convergence is almost upon us. This is my opportunity to change the world.
12051,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Eska,"We'll make it up to you, Father."
12052,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,"Good, because I'll need your help to open the northern portal."
12053,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Desna,I thought only the Avatar could do it.
12054,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,I believe there is another way.
12055,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,This way.
12056,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,"There it is, the northern portal."
12057,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Director,"Cut! Okay, that's lunch, everyone."
12058,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bolin,"Hello? Anyone? Nuktuk's still up here, all alone. Asami! Hey, what are you doing here?"
12059,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,Varrick invited me to watch some of the filming. Are you filming right now?
12060,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bolin,Right now? Nope. We're uh ... we're at lunch.
12061,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,"Asami, there you are. Is Bolin around?"
12062,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bolin,Up here.
12063,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,Good. I've got something to tell you both.
12064,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bolin,"Ahh! Ow, aww. Oh, I got to stop doing my own ''stunts''."
12065,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries: Varrick.
12066,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bolin,What? No.
12067,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,He attacked his own ship?
12068,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,"Yes! It was a ploy. He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it. He already had all the shipping. All he needed was Future Industries."
12069,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,"Varrick helped ''save'' Future Industries. He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind. Mako, you seemed stressed."
12070,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,I ''am'' stressed!
12071,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bolin,"See, this is why I had to move out."
12072,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,You guys aren't living together anymore?
12073,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bolin,Nope. It was time for this eagle hawk to spread his wings and fly.
12074,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,Sounds like you've had a pretty busy week. Maybe you just need to relax.
12075,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,Dating? No!
12076,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,That's crazy!
12077,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bolin,Korra just left a week ago!
12078,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,"Guys, listen to me. Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof. The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the cultural center attack. And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when Asami's shipment was hijacked. Don't you see?"
12079,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,Anyone could have gotten their hands on one of those detonators.
12080,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,Gah! No! I'm not going to let it go!
12081,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bodyguard,Varrick's been looking for you.
12082,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"You're lucky. This temple is the most spiritual of all the air temples. Why, this very garden is where my father met Guru Pathik."
12083,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"Wow! Spirit World, here we come."
12084,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,I would be if Meelo could ring his bell at the appropriate intervals.
12085,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Meelo,"Aww, did I do it wrong?"
12086,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,I thought your bell ringing was just fine.
12087,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Meelo,Thanks!
12088,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"Kya, this is too much smoke. You set it up wrong. This isn't going to work."
12089,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,I'm sorry. I did what you told me.
12090,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"Well, the moment's ruined."
12091,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,We could have tried a little longer.
12092,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"Come back, Furry-Foot."
12093,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,"Hey, Jinora, what are you chasing?"
12094,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,Nothing.
12095,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"Focus, Korra. Focus."
12096,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,I am focusing.
12097,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,No talking. Feel the energy of the universe.
12098,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"Okay, I feel it."
12099,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"Korra, really! I'm trying to concentrate here! I don't think this location is going to work either."
12100,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"What's going on with you? First, you're blaming Meelo, then Kya, and now me."
12101,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"Well, nothing is feeling right to me."
12102,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"I don't want to rush your feelings, but we're kind of in a hurry. How did you first get into the Spirit World? Let's try that."
12103,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"Well ... actually, I've never been into the Spirit World."
12104,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,You've never been into the Spirit World?
12105,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Pema,But you used to spend days in the temple meditating.
12106,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"''Trying'' to get in. It never happened. It's my greatest shortcoming as an airbender, spiritual leader, and son of Aang."
12107,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,"Welcome to the ""I Disappoint Dad"" club."
12108,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,"If you've never been to the Spirit World, how were you planning to get Korra into it?"
12109,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"I've spent years studying the techniques and theories of ancient spiritual leaders. Now that the Avatar needs me, it must be my time."
12110,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,You have to trust me. I can help you.
12111,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,"There might be another way. Jinora, is there something you want to tell Korra?"
12112,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,Jinora? She's too young and untrained to have any knowledge about spiritual matters.
12113,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"Actually, I think I do know where Korra needs to go to get into the Spirit World."
12114,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,And how would you know that?
12115,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,My spirit friends showed me. It's okay. You can show yourselves.
12116,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,How did you do that?
12117,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Pema,Jinora.
12118,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Meelo,Bunnies!
12119,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"Actually, they're dragonfly bunny spirits."
12120,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,I knew it. Looks like she does know something about spiritual matters.
12121,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Ikki,So cute!
12122,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Meelo,Bunnies!
12123,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Ikki,Come back!
12124,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,How long have you been able to do this?
12125,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,I don't know. I guess I've always kind of had a connection with spirits.
12126,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,I think this one likes me.
12127,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,Are they here to help?
12128,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,I think they want you to go down there.
12129,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,I don't know. The spiritual energy is historically strongest ''near'' the temple.
12130,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"No offense, but I'm guessing the spirits have actually been to the Spirit World, so I'm gonna follow them."
12131,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,"If we need to go to the Tenzin World, we'll call you."
12132,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Eska,"Father, haven't the spirits had ten thousand years to open this portal?"
12133,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Desna,"If they could not succeed, what makes you think we will?"
12134,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,"By entering the Spirit World through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: our bending. Join me! Together, we can open this portal."
12135,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Eska,Desna!
12136,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,Leave him! Keep bending!
12137,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Eska,He needs a healer at once!
12138,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,This is more important!
12139,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Eska,I'm taking him back.
12140,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Varrick,I hear you've got some ideas. You wanna tell me about them?
12141,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,Go ahead. Torture me all you want. I'm not gonna talk.
12142,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,Know what?
12143,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Varrick,"That the world is a dangerous place, and that's exactly why I want to offer you a job on my security force."
12144,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,I have a job.
12145,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Varrick,"We need you. Me, Asami, Bolin. We're all in the same team here. We want you to join us. You wouldn't want anything to happen to Asami, would you? I mean, I heard you and her were kind of, uh, an item again. Or what about your brother?"
12146,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,What are you saying?
12147,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Varrick,"I'm saying I want your help to ''protect'' them. Without you, who knows what could happen."
12148,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,"Thanks for your ''concern'', but the answer is no."
12149,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,"Oh, you are just so cute. I'm going to name you Bum-Ju. It's short for ""Bumi Junior"". Don't you think he looks like me?"
12150,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,The resemblance is uncanny.
12151,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,I think Dad's mad at me.
12152,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,Your father's not mad. His pride's just a little bruised since he isn't able to see spirits like you.
12153,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,You have a natural gift. That's pretty lucky.
12154,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"You're the lucky one. You actually got to meet the first Avatar. I know about a lot of Avatars, but I don't know anything about him. Is it even a him? Or is it her?"
12155,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"It's a him, Avatar Wan. He was amazing. I saw how he became the first Avatar by fusing with Raava, the Spirit of Light."
12156,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,The Avatar is part spirit? Of course! Just like the statue.
12157,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,What statue?
12158,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"When we were at the Southern Air Temple, I was drawn to this old carving. I couldn't figure out what it was until now. It was the first Avatar."
12159,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,When did this happen?
12160,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,It was on the solstice.
12161,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,That's the day I opened the Southern portal.
12162,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra and Jinora,Whoa.
12163,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,We're here!
12164,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,Are you sure these spirits are leading us into the right place?
12165,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,Of course! I trust Bum-Ju with my life.
12166,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,Look. There are carvings on them.
12167,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,This is an ancient airbender meditation circle.
12168,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"There's a lot of spiritual energy in this place, but it feels really strange."
12169,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,We'll have to perform a spiritual cleansing ceremony.
12170,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,What are you talking about?
12171,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,Dad taught it to me. This site has been neglected for many years. A cleansing ceremony will help strengthen its connections to the Spirit World.
12172,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,"Good job, you cleansed the area of the only spirits that want to help us, and you scared away Bum-Ju."
12173,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,It's working.
12174,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Bumi,Ah! Bats! Evil bats!
12175,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,Not bats. Dark spirits.
12176,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,What are we supposed to do?
12177,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,Amazing.
12178,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,Your spiritual training has come a long way.
12179,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"Unalaq may be a horrible person, but his spirit powers are no joke."
12180,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,He taught you how to transform dark spirits. I can't even get you into the Spirit World.
12181,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,Everything Unalaq taught me was to help himself. Everything you've done was meant to help me. I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor. I need you now more than ever.
12182,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,I won't let you down.
12183,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"The ancient airbenders must have built this site. If we meditate here, we'll be able to enter the Spirit World."
12184,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,Why don't you go first?
12185,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"After all these years, my father's dreams for me will finally come true."
12186,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,Hi.
12187,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,Did you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?
12188,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,No. I just wanted to come by to make sure you're okay. You seemed so agitated earlier.
12189,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,I'm fine.
12190,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,Maybe you need a night off. Why don't we go get some dinner?
12191,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,"No, thanks. I'm a little busy."
12192,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,Too busy for Kwong's Cuisine? Remember? We had our first date there.
12193,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,Maybe I do need to get my mind off things.
12194,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Lu,"Police! Hey, Mako. Hope we didn't interrupt you two lovebirds."
12195,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,What's going on?
12196,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Lu,We busted some Triple Threats who said you hired them for a job.
12197,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,"All right. It's true. We were trying to figure out who stole Asami's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation. I'm sorry for going behind your back."
12198,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Lin,"According to the Triple Threats, you did more than that. They said you helped them steal a warehouse full of Future Industries property."
12199,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,That's crazy!
12200,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,You're gonna believe a bunch of criminals?
12201,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Lin,I have to follow up on a lead.
12202,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Lu,"Well, looky what I found: cash ... And these."
12203,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Lin,"What are you doing with explosives, Mako?"
12204,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,I don't know where those came from.
12205,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Gang,You're under arrest.
12206,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,None of that is mine.
12207,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Gang,"Yeah. Should've known you'd hook up with your old ''pals''. Once a Triple Threat, ''always'' a Triple Threat."
12208,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Asami,This has to be a mistake.
12209,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Lu,"Sorry to break the news to you, sweetie, but your boyfriend's just a crooked cop. That ''sting'' operation was just a way to lure you away from your warehouse."
12210,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Gang,He was using you the ''whole'' time.
12211,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Mako,"That's not true, Asami. I would never do anything to hurt you. It's ''Varrick''. This is all ''Varrick''. He set me up!"
12212,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Gang,"Yeah, it's Varrick's fault. Varrick. Varrick."
12213,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,"It's okay, Tenzin. Maybe you weren't meant to guide Korra into the Spirit World."
12214,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,No! Just give me some time.
12215,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Kya,''Stop'' being so stubborn. It's not your destiny. I think ''Jinora'' was meant to guide the Avatar.
12216,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,"Jinora will ''not'' enter the Spirit World! She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but ''I am''. I've spent ''years'' training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the Spirit World."
12217,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,"Tenzin, we're running out of time."
12218,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,If everyone could just be quiet and let me ''focus''.
12219,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,Aunt Kya is right. I can guide Korra into the Spirit World. I'll be all right.
12220,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,Perhaps I will never have the connections with spirits like I always wanted ... like my father wanted me to have.
12221,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Jinora,"It's okay, Daddy."
12222,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Tenzin,I'm proud of you. Go. Close the portal. We'll wait here and keep your bodies safe till you return.
12223,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,We'll be all right.
12224,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Korra,The Spirit World.
12225,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,"The Avatar is dead, and we cannot open the Northern portal. I have failed you, Vaatu."
12226,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Vaatu,You have not failed me ... yet. The Avatar still lives.
12227,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,How do you know?
12228,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Vaatu,"Even though my connection to Raava was severed, I can still feel her presence."
12229,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Unalaq,I'll find her.
12230,2,The Guide,Spirits,2,82,Vaatu,The Avatar will find you. She has just entered the Spirit World.
12231,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Tenzin,I can't believe my little girl had to guide Korra into the Spirit World instead of me. If anything happens to her I won't be able to forgive myself.
12232,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Kya,"She's very smart, and she obviously has a strong connection to the spirits. She'll be fine."
12233,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Bumi,"Yeah, Dad went all the time!"
12234,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Tenzin,They won't have their bending in there. They'll be defenseless!
12235,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Tenzin,"Of course you aren't, because ''you'' have your ... um ..."
12236,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Kya,Positive attitude?
12237,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Bumi,"I would've said acute intellect and cat-like reflexes, but whatever."
12238,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Tenzin,Why don't you two get some sleep. I'll take the first watch.
12239,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Kya,Wake us up if you need some company.
12240,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Bumi,"Or if any interesting spirit-y stuff happens, like their bodies start floating around and you need someone to help you grab them before they fly off!"
12241,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Kya,Bumi!
12242,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Bumi,"I'm just saying, we're here if you need us."
12243,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Tenzin,I know you are. Thank you. Please come back soon.
12244,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Isn't it beautiful?
12245,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"Just ... stick close to me, okay? This seems nice, but you never know when we'll run into some dark spirits. Huh!"
12246,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Look! It's like it's made of jewels! The spirits are so much more beautiful in their own world than they are at home.
12247,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"Jinora, be careful! Hold on! Uh!"
12248,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Sorry!
12249,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,I'm the Avatar.
12250,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,I'm trying to find the spirit portals? I opened one-
12251,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"No, I did, but-"
12252,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,B-because I was at the South Pole!
12253,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Get away from me!
12254,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Jinora!
12255,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Korra! Stay calm! Your energy is upsetting them. You're only making it worse!
12256,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Ahhh!
12257,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Jinora!
12258,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Jinora? Jinora!
12259,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Jinora.
12260,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Jinora.
12261,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Korra! Where are you! Hello? I'm lost. Can anyone help me?
12262,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Ahhh! Get away!
12263,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,I'm sorry I swatted you. You just scared me.
12264,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,You two look lost. Maybe I can help you.
12265,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,I know you.
12266,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,I was good friends with Avatar Aang.
12267,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Iroh!
12268,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"Hello, Korra."
12269,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"I'm glad you came to visit us in the Spirit World, Korra. You came just in time. We're having a little tea party, to celebrate May-Jim's wedding."
12270,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,How can you marry each other? Aren't you ...
12271,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,May,Complete opposites? I know!
12272,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jim,"I tried to fight it, but she really grew on me!"
12273,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"The Spirit World is very mysterious, but so is love. Help yourself to some tea and cakes. They are spirit cakes, so you won't gain any weight- of course, you won't lose any either!"
12274,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"That's right. It was yours long, long ago. When you were Avatar Wan, you used it to carry the light spirit, Raava, around- until the two of you became one. It is my favorite thing I found here. You know, when you make tea in it, you can still taste a little light in every cup."
12275,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,"Wow. I could just stay in here forever, reading."
12276,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Wan Shi Tong,The last human who said that is still here.
12277,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Professor Zei!
12278,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Wan Shi Tong,"I see that you have some knowledge of the past, so you should know that humans are no longer allowed in my library. Get out."
12279,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,I thought anyone could come in if they brought you some new knowledge?
12280,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Wan Shi Tong,"Those are the old rules. Besides, what has a little girl got to teach Wan Shi Tong, he who knows ten thousand things?"
12281,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,"Well, since you've been down in the Spirit World, the humans have invented radio."
12282,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Wan Shi Tong,"Yes, I am well aware of the radio."
12283,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,But do you know how it works?
12284,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Wan Shi Tong,"Of course I do! There is a box, and inside the box, there is a tiny man who sings and plays musical instruments."
12285,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,"Actually, when we speak, our voices produce sound waves. Radio takes those sound waves and converts them into electromagnetic energy that is transmitted through the spectrum-"
12286,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Wan Shi Tong,"All right, enough. I did not know this. Apparently, I have been fed some ''misinformation'' about the existence of tiny men in boxes. Still, I am not interested in that human garbage. Now, go away."
12287,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,"My grandfather was the Avatar, and I came to the Spirit World with the new Avatar to find the spirit portals. I would think that you'd wanna help me."
12288,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Wan Shi Tong,"You came with the Avatar, hm? Well, why didn't you say so! Fine, you may look around. But don't break anything- I'll know."
12289,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,"Come on, Furry-Foot, we gotta hurry!"
12290,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,They say that the game of Pai Sho was invented by the spirits ... although some of them don't seem to grasp it very well.
12291,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Radish lotus spirit,Just hold on. I'm thinking.
12292,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"As you can see, it is a game that requires great patience. But time does not mean much to us here."
12293,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,How long have you lived here?
12294,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"Oh, I've been here for many years. I had always enjoyed the company of the spirits, so when my work was done in the material world, I chose to leave my body behind and come to the Spirit World! It can be a wonderful place, and I've made so many friends. Korra, what's wrong?"
12295,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"I came here with my friend, but I lost her and now I'm all alone."
12296,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"You're not alone Korra, it's okay."
12297,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"No! It's not okay! Jinora's gone and I need to find her! She's lost, and we need to go home! I don't like the Spirit World, I don't want to be here anymore!"
12298,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,May,Did you say something to her?
12299,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jim,Me? You're the one with the big mouth!
12300,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"Korra, please stop! Look at what you're doing to everyone!"
12301,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"In the Spirit World, your emotions become your reality- especially for the Avatar, because ''you'' are the bridge between the two worlds. You must try to stay positive."
12302,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,I'm sorry.
12303,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"There, you see?"
12304,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,I can make the sun shine?
12305,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark, that is all you will ever see."
12306,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,I'm looking for my friend. I want her here now! Why didn't she come out like the sun?
12307,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,I'm afraid finding her won't be so easy.
12308,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,But what am I supposed to do?
12309,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else. This little fellow needs to go home as well. Maybe if you help him find his friends, you will be able to find yours."
12310,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,I'll take him home! Where do I go?
12311,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"The dragon bird nest is located there, at the top of Hai-Riyo Peak."
12312,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,"Ugh, it's not in here either! I have to find the portals. Korra is probably waiting for me there right now! I need to find a map that shows where the spirit portals are, could you help me? Thanks, this is it! The Tree of Time! That's where Avatar Wan imprisoned Vaatu! The elders believe that as long as the portals are closed during the Harmonic Convergence, Vaatu will remain imprisoned and the battle between good and evil will not be fought again. But, if both portals are open, spirit energy is amplified greatly. During the Harmonic Convergence, this energy will be great enough to allow Vaatu to break free from his bonds, and the material world will again risk being consumed by darkness. We have to warn Korra!"
12313,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Unalaq,"Leaving so soon? When Wan Shi Tong told me he had a visitor, I had to see it with my own eyes. I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself - what kind of a father is he?"
12314,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,"Better than you. Wan Shi Tong, how can you be helping him?"
12315,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Wan Shi Tong,Unalaq has proven to be a true friend to the spirits - unlike the Avatar.
12316,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Why would you wanna help Vaatu escape? He'll destroy everything!
12317,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Unalaq,"Don't believe everything you read. Why don't you come with me, so you can do some firsthand research?"
12318,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Furry-Foot ...?
12319,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,This looks scary. Will you come with me?
12320,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"This is something that you must do on your own. The people who have been coming to the Spirit World lately have brought darkness and anger. So that is what you see now. But you have light and peace inside of you. If you let it out, you can change the world around you. Besides, look at this little fellow. This mountain is his home. When you first met him, you were frightened. But does he seem scary to you now?"
12321,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,No!
12322,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Iroh,"Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine light on them. It was good to meet you. Come visit me again - in this life, or the next."
12323,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"Bye! Okay, time for you to go home. Light and peace ... light and peace ..."
12324,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"I'm not afraid of you. You're not scary! You just look that way. I have light inside! It's okay, you can be my friends. My name is Korra, and I'm taking this dragon bird home! Iroh said you could be nice. Do you wanna help me? All right, now let's close that portal and go find Jinora."
12325,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,That's where Vaatu is.
12326,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Vaatu,"So you've returned, Raava. The Harmonic Convergence is coming soon, and this time, I'm going to wipe you out ''for good''."
12327,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"I think you've said that before, Vaatu. But I'm here to close the portal. You're not getting out."
12328,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Vaatu,You might want to reconsider- that is if you want to save your friend.
12329,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,"Jinora! I can't believe I trusted you! You made me think you wanted to restore balance with spirits, but this- this isn't balance, it's madness! Now let her go!"
12330,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Unalaq,"If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal ''now''."
12331,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Don't do it Korra!
12332,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Unalaq,What will it be? Open the portal- or lose your friend's soul forever?
12333,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Stop! I'll do it. Now let Jinora go. Ahhh!
12334,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Unalaq,You should've come through the portal. Then you could do this!
12335,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Jinora,Ahhh! Korra!
12336,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Ahhh!
12337,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Vaatu,"I'll see you soon, Raava. Once the Harmonic Convergence comes, I'll be free from this prison, and then I will have my ''revenge''!"
12338,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Tenzin,Korra! What was it like? Did you manage to close the portal? Was Jinora able to help you?
12339,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Korra,Tenzin- I'm ... I'm sorry.
12340,2,A New Spiritual Age,Spirits,2,83,Tenzin,Where's Jinora? W-Why isn't she waking up? Korra! What happened to my little girl?
12341,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Shiro Shinobi,"Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the Northern portal and trapped Jinora in the Spirit World. Back in Republic City, everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers. Everybody, that is, except Mako, whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer. And in the Southern Water Tribe, Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the Civil War, but Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight."
12342,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Meelo,Dad's back.
12343,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Pema,Where's Jinora? No!
12344,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tenzin,"Her spirit is trapped in the Spirit World, but she's going to be all right."
12345,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Pema,How could this happen?
12346,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,"I'm so sorry, Pema. I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me."
12347,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tenzin,"Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us."
12348,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Song,You've got a visitor.
12349,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Hey, Mako."
12350,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"I'm on my way to the big finale for ""Nuktuk: Hero of the South."" Yeah, everyone's gonna be there except for, you know, you ... because you're in jail and stuff."
12351,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Hey, I brought you something. I thought this would brighten up your new place. Read the inscription."
12352,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"No, I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement. I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you. We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal."
12353,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,I am not a criminal!
12354,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Of course ''I'' know that, but you do kinda look like one, cause you're in a jail and that's where criminals live."
12355,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,I was set up! Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war. That's why he had me arrested.
12356,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Ah, I see what you're doing. You're going for the insanity defense. Smart."
12357,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,No! I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems. Where's Asami? She'll listen to me.
12358,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,"Bolin, wait. If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere. Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled."
12359,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Rebel leader,Should we wait another day? Korra still might come with reinforcements.
12360,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tonraq,We can't wait any longer. It's time to take back what is ours! It's time to take back our city!
12361,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Rebels,Yeah!
12362,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Photographer,"Say ""Nuktuk""!"
12363,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Ginger,"Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend. We are ''not'' a couple."
12364,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,That's not what Shiro said!
12365,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,Stop stuffing your mustaches with Varri-cakes and get to your post!
12366,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Gang,"You got it, boss."
12367,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,You two are the pinnacle of refinement.
12368,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"There they are, my two most honored guests. What do you think? No expense has been spared, I brought in the finest entertainers from Ba Sing Se, and the best food from around the world. Heck! I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation! They make the ''best'' red stuff over there. Fact! All right, picture time."
12369,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Raiko,"Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us."
12370,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"I wanted to. Mister President, I took one look at your wife and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste. And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!"
12371,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Raiko,"Varrick, I know what you're doing, and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind about going to war with the Northern Water Tribe."
12372,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"Oh, I think you'll be surprised how persuasive I can be."
12373,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"Thank you all for coming for the finale of ""Nuktuk: Hero of the South""! You know, when I first started this project there were a lot of naysayers out there. ""You can't make pictures move"" they said. ""You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a star"" they said. ""You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak"" they said. Well, they're ''wrong''! Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices, and you'll be ''shocked'' to hear what they have to say. They speak of the injustice that is happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now. My hope, is that their words, and this epic mover, will inspire a real life hero to rise up, and help. Thank you again, enjoy the show!"
12374,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Voice narrator,"When last we left our hero, he was captured by the Evil Unalaq's dastardly pet bird. Amazingly, with the power of his whistling, Nuktuk escaped. And decided to seek out council."
12375,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Nuktuk,"Thank you, wise sage. I will travel to Republic City and seek help."
12376,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mover president,"Have a seat, I'm just working on a cure for the common cold. No longer will my citizens suffer from the sniffles."
12377,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Nuktuk,"Mister president, there's something more important than the sniffles right now. I need your help to stop the Evil Unalaq."
12378,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mover president,"Did you say ""help""? If there is one thing I love doing, it's helping people."
12379,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Buttercup Raiko,"The seal lion seemed a bit far fetched, but the portrayal of this president ''is right on the money''."
12380,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Asami,I think this is your best mover yet.
12381,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,I just wish Mako was here to see it.
12382,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lu,Mmm. I like to eat the top of the Varri-cake first.
12383,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Gang,I just try to shove the whole thing in my mouth at once.
12384,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lu,I love our job.
12385,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Nuktuk,Northern Water Tribe automatons! No!
12386,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Automatons,"Bee bow bop, Nuktuk cannot stop Unalaq, must destroy Nuktuk."
12387,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Nuktuk,"Haha! Arhg! Looks like you forgot that water, and automatons, don't mix."
12388,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Automatons,"Bee bow bop, oh no, circuits no working."
12389,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Nuktuk,"Hahaho! We did it! But wait, where's Juji?"
12390,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Nuktuk,You can't die Juji! Not on my watch!
12391,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Juji,"It's okay, Nuktuk. At least ... I got to be your friend."
12392,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Nuktuk,Juji!
12393,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Asami,Are you okay? It seems like this mover is really getting to you. You do know Juji's not really dead?
12394,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,Of course I know. Juji's fine. He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth. Oops. Spoiler. Sorry.
12395,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Asami,Then what's wrong?
12396,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"I guess I just miss my friends. Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around. Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing ... business-lady stuff. Team Avatar's fallen apart."
12397,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Asami,I know. Things have changed to much since we first met. Why don't you come back in and finish watching the mover with me?
12398,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,You go ahead. I need another another minute. That's weird.
12399,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Gang,They're after the president!
12400,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Evil Unalaq,"You're too late Nuktuk. Soon, my doomsday device will shoot this block of ice into the Earth's core, freezing the entire planet, and ''I'' will be ruler of Ice Earth!"
12401,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,I don't think so.
12402,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Mister President, get back, I'm here to help."
12403,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,Looks like there's no where to go.
12404,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,Secure the president and call for backup immediately!
12405,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Shiro Shinobi,"This is unbelievable! Bolin is bending two full stacks of earth disks at once, which would normally be illegal, but then again, he's fighting three waterbenders, so all rules are out the window!"
12406,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,Tell me who sent you!
12407,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Soldier,"It was Varrick, please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!"
12408,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,I think this is our cue to exit.
12409,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,Where do you think you're going?
12410,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Shiro Shinobi,It's a knockout!
12411,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tonraq,They're falling back!
12412,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,"Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the North. Then Republic City would have no choice, but to join the war on the side of the South."
12413,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Raiko,"I can't believe Varrick would do something like this, and no one saw it coming."
12414,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,Actually someone did. Remember Mako?
12415,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Raiko,You got a great officer on your hands.
12416,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,He's one of the best.
12417,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Ginger,I can't believe my boyfriend is a real life hero!
12418,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Boyfriend? Wait, stop. I thought you said we ''weren't'' a couple."
12419,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Ginger,You really are as dumb as those rocks. Of course we're a couple.
12420,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Asami,Bolin you saved the president! And you proved Mako was right all along. We have to go tell him what happened.
12421,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Yeah! Oh, you meant right now."
12422,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,President Raiko!
12423,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Raiko,Avatar Korra? What's wrong?
12424,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,"Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed. Unalaq doesn't just wanna take over the South anymore. He wants to destroy the whole world."
12425,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,Unalaq is going to destroy the world? He really does have a doomsday device?
12426,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,"He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during Harmonic Convergence, which is only a few days away. If he succeeds, the world as we know it, is over. Sir, we desperately need your help."
12427,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Raiko,"I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no."
12428,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tenzin,"There are lives on the line! And my daughter is one of them! Raiko, you must reconsider!"
12429,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Raiko,"I'm aware that lives are on the line. And that's precisely why my troops are staying here. If the world is going to be thrown into chaos as you claim, I need to protect my citizens. I'm sorry."
12430,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Sir, Nuktuk needs your help. I know you love helping people."
12431,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Raiko,"Son, I appreciate you saving my life and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final."
12432,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,Never should have saved that guy.
12433,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Asami,"If you guys need help, I'm here for you."
12434,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Yeah, me too."
12435,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,Thank you. It's so good to see you guys again. Wait. Where's Mako?
12436,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,"So, how was the big premiere?"
12437,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"I saved the president, in real life!"
12438,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,"Wait, wh-what?"
12439,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,You were right about Varrick. He tried to kidnap Raiko!
12440,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,I knew it!
12441,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"But it didn't work, because of you, and because of me. Let's just say we both did good. Beifong says you're free to go. Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako."
12442,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,Don't worry about it bro.
12443,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,"Nice job, Mako. You're going to make a great detective."
12444,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Gang,"But chief, there aren't any detective openings right now."
12445,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Lin Beifong,Actually we have two openings.
12446,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,"Mako, I've missed you so much."
12447,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,"Oh yeah, did I forget to tell you? Korra's back."
12448,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,"Korra ... hey, I missed you, too. So you're not still mad at me?"
12449,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,Why would I be mad?
12450,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,"We had that fight before you left, remember?"
12451,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,"No, not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?"
12452,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,"Uh ... No. No, it wasn't that bad."
12453,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tenzin,"Korra, we don't have much time. We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq."
12454,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,I think I know just the man to talk to.
12455,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"Guys, hey, what do you think? Varrick Industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special. I had a feeling I'd end up here one day. Zhu Li, c'mon, we got guests! Whip up a pot of that green tea I love!''"
12456,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Zhu Li,"Yes, sir."
12457,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,Zhu Li's in prison with you?
12458,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,Of course! I don't go anywhere without my assistant. Do you?
12459,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,We're not interested in your tea. And this isn't a friendly visit.
12460,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened. I did some good things, too. Korra, who warned you about Unalaq? I did. Bolin, who got you into the movers? I did. Asami, who saved your company? I did. Mako, who got you thrown in jail!? I did! Oh yeah, guess that was a bad thing."
12461,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Asami,"You stole everything from me and you tried to kidnap the president. Those are pretty bad, too."
12462,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"I wasn't going to hurt him. I just needed to start a war. Well, a bigger war."
12463,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,Well we're gonna end it. Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?
12464,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,The Future Industries' stuff? It's on my battleship.
12465,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,You have a battleship?
12466,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"Of course I do! I bought the first one they made! Named her the ""Zhu Li""."
12467,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,You named your battleship after your assistant?
12468,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"Yup. They're both cold, heartless war machines."
12469,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Zhu Li,"Your tea, sir."
12470,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Varrick,"Look, I'm truly sorry for the mess I caused. Let me make it up to you, take Zhu Li. My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
12471,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,"It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
12472,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Bolin,All right! Team Avatar is back in business. Haha!
12473,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,"It's okay. We're going to stop Unalaq, and get Jinora back."
12474,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Korra,I hope my dad's all right.
12475,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Mako,I'm sure he's fine.
12476,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tonraq,Get the men and fall back.
12477,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Rebel,What about you?
12478,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tonraq,"I'm going to end this, right now. Go."
12479,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Unalaq,"Hello, Tonraq. Looking for me?"
12480,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Unalaq,"Brother, I'm too strong for you."
12481,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tonraq,"You're no brother of mine. You betrayed me, you had me banished!"
12482,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Unalaq,Yes! I did.
12483,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Unalaq,Stop! He's mine.
12484,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Tonraq,You are ''not'' the true chief.
12485,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Unalaq,I am. And you will bow to me.
12486,2,Night of a Thousand Stars,Spirits,2,84,Unalaq,"Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next."
12487,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Shiro Shinobi,"Bolin's a hero. The mover's star stopped Varrick's kidnapping attempt on President Raiko, proving his brother's innocence. Mako and Korra were reunited, but Korra has no memory of their break-up. Meanwhile, Jinora's spirit is still trapped in the Spirit World, and Tonraq and his southern forces have been defeated. Now it's up to Team Avatar to stop Unalaq before Harmonic Convergence."
12488,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Mako,What's up with the coat? And where did you get that pie?
12489,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,"It's a Varrick ship, you never know what you're gonna find. There's a whole level filled with fun-house mirrors. Of course, there's also the catgator deck. I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting. So, have you told Korra yet about how you guys broke up, and you kinda started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?"
12490,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Mako,Will you keep it down? I'm waiting for the right moment.
12491,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,"Oh Mako, you know a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech: you just have to do it fast and get it over with."
12492,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Mako,I hate it when you listen to me. Fine!
12493,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,Unalaq will be waiting for you. You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him.
12494,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock Vaatu in for another ten thousand years, and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born."
12495,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,Thanks Mako.
12496,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Mako,Uh ... Um ...
12497,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,Did you want something?
12498,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Mako,"Uh no, no, nothing."
12499,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,"As soon as we reach the Southern Water Tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main portal. Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the Spirit World."
12500,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Kya,Woah! Since when does my little brother wanna crash or blast through anything?
12501,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter.
12502,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"We all want to save Jinora, but I think your plan might be a tad over-aggressive, seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship."
12503,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,Really? And what do you suggest?
12504,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"An attack like this calls for strategy. I remember when I was surrounded by pirates at the Hurricane Straits. We managed to capture them all, with just a feather, two eggs and a barrel of molasses."
12505,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now! This is serious!
12506,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,Are we almost there?
12507,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Asami,"Almost, but ... I just picked up a distress signal from the southern troops. There's a problem."
12508,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,Mom!
12509,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Senna,I'm so happy you're here.
12510,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,Where's Dad?
12511,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Senna,"Unalaq wiped out the entire southern resistance, and captured your father."
12512,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,I'll get him back.
12513,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,Where is my mother?
12514,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Senna,She's in the healing hut. So many injured.
12515,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Katara,What happened?
12516,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,Her soul is trapped in the Spirit World.
12517,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Katara,Oh my goodness! How long has she been away?
12518,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Kya,"Almost a week. I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away. You're the only one who can help her now, Mom."
12519,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,How much longer can she survive like this?
12520,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Katara,"I don't know, but she is very strong to have lasted this long."
12521,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,I talked to the rebels. They said Unalaq's got the southern portal surrounded. Harmonic Convergence is only a few hours away.
12522,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.
12523,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,There's no use in talking any more. We know what our mission is.
12524,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,A suicide mission ...
12525,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"You know, I was in a similar situation once. My platoon had crawled through the desert with no water for a week! But when we finally located the only oasis for a hundred miles, it was surrounded by angry sandbenders. I realized our only chance to get to the water was to drop in from above. So I fashioned together a catapult, and with the help of a few well-trained hog monkeys ..."
12526,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,Enough of your ridiculous lies! Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?!
12527,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Asami,"Hold on, maybe Bumi's right. We don't have a catapult and hog monkeys, but we have a flying bison and there's a plane on Varrick's ship. Maybe we can attack from above."
12528,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,What are you thinking?
12529,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Asami,"Mako, Bolin and I can use the plane to create a distraction, and scatter some of the defenses. You, Tenzin, Bumi and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening."
12530,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,Let's get moving.
12531,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Eska,"What are we still doing here, Father?"
12532,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Desna,The invasion was completely successful and the southern tribe is under our control. The spirit portals are open.
12533,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Eska,You've restored balance. Now we would like to go home.
12534,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Unalaq,You don't understand. Everything I've achieved so far will pale in comparison with what I'm about to accomplish.
12535,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Desna,What else is there? The Water Tribe is united.
12536,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Eska,From whom? We've already beaten everyone.
12537,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Unalaq,The Avatar will be here soon. She has no choice ...
12538,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Asami,Are you ready?!
12539,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,"I'm an earthbender, strapped to the wing of a plane, hundreds of feet in the air, so, no?"
12540,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Mako,"Don't worry, there's no way they'll be expecting this."
12541,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,I think they were expecting it!
12542,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,Asami!
12543,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Asami,Get ready! Fire!
12544,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,There are spirits everywhere. I don't see an opening.
12545,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,Let's circle around and see if we can find a way in from the other side. Hold on!
12546,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,The spirits are weighting Oogi down! We're losing altitude!
12547,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"Get off of him you sticky, nasty little blob of goo! Woah! If I go, you're coming with me!"
12548,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Kya,Bumi!
12549,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,"I wish Varrick was filming this! We could call it ""Nuktuk: Sky Warrior""!"
12550,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Asami,Brace yourselves!
12551,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,Dad ...
12552,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tonraq,Korra ... I'm so sorry. I failed you.
12553,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,Don't give up. Harmonic Convergence isn't here yet. We still have a chance.
12554,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Mako,We tried.
12555,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Unalaq,"Congratulations, everyone. You've all got front row seats for the beginning of a new world order."
12556,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq. Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful, it will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened over the last ten thousand years."
12557,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Unalaq,"You think what Avatar Wan did was good? Driving almost all the spirits from this world? The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos. You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds, but there shouldn't ''be'' a bridge: we should live together as one."
12558,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"Even if Vaatu escapes, I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did."
12559,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Unalaq,"It's true that when Wan fused with Raava he tipped the scales in her favor, but this time I'll be here to level the playing field. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will fuse with Vaatu, and together we will become the new Avatar: a Dark Avatar. Your era is over."
12560,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tonraq,"Think about what you're doing. I know that you've always had a deep connection with the spirits, but you're still a man. You're still my brother, you're Eska and Desna's father. Are you willing to throw your humanity away to become a monster?"
12561,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Unalaq,"I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter. The only difference is that while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power, I will be in complete alignment with mine. Vaatu and I will be as one. No one will be able to stand against us. Keep them locked up. After the Harmonic Convergence, I will come for Korra."
12562,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Eska,"Yes, Father."
12563,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,I failed in every way. We've lost Jinora forever.
12564,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Kya,There's still a chance. They didn't get Bumi.
12565,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"Oh, you wanna play some more? Well, bring it on. Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?"
12566,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"Hmm ... Looks like we've got a music lover here. Reinforcements! All right, soldiers, looks like it's on us to save the day, luckily I've got a plan."
12567,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"Eska, Desna, listen to me. You've got to help us stop Unalaq. I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy."
12568,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Eska,We will never turn on our father.
12569,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"Please. If you let me out now, I can still stop him from destroying everything. Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe. Desna, he won't be your father anymore."
12570,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Desna,"You don't know what you're talking about! Our father is the wisest man in the world. If he says what he is doing is right, I believe him."
12571,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Northern soldier 1,Huh?
12572,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Northern soldier 2,"You know, if I wanted some ball of evil lurking over my shoulder all the time, I'd have stayed home with my mother-in-law."
12573,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"All right, spirit army. Your general is here. Follow me! It's working! It's not working!"
12574,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,Get me out of here!
12575,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"All right guys, rescue time."
12576,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,"Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?"
12577,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bumi,"I did it all with my trusty flute and ... ah, never mind, you wouldn't believe it anyway. Let's get moving."
12578,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tonraq,"You run into the portal, I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you."
12579,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"No, you're too hurt, you need a healer. Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom?"
12580,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Asami,Mhmm.
12581,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,This is my fight now.
12582,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tonraq,"Korra, I love you."
12583,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"I love you too, Dad."
12584,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Asami,Yip-yip.
12585,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"Once we're inside, you go find Jinora. Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq, while I close the portal so Vaatu can't escape."
12586,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Bolin,"Wait a second. Worst-case scenario: so we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals and let's just say ''something'' happens to you. Are we going to be trapped in there for eternity?"
12587,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after Harmonic Convergence. If not ... Let's go."
12588,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Korra,"Tenzin, go find Jinora!"
12589,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Tenzin,C'mon!
12590,2,Harmonic Convergence (episode),Spirits,2,85,Vaatu,"You're running out of time, Raava. I know you feel it coming."
12591,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Shiro Shinobi,"After ten thousand years, Harmonic Convergence is here again, and the dark spirit Vaatu is free. Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya have entered the portal to rescue Jinora's spirit. Asami split from the group and took the injured Tonraq to safety. So it's up to Korra, Mako, and Bolin to stop Unalaq before he fuses with Vaatu and becomes a Dark Avatar."
12592,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Vaatu,"Raava, nothing could stop this moment. Harmonic Convergence is upon us again."
12593,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Korra,I'm not going to let you fuse with Unalaq. You're going right back in that prison.
12594,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Korra,Don't let Unalaq back in the Spirit World.
12595,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bolin,We're on it.
12596,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,Jinora. Jinora's spirit do you hear me? It's your Uncle Bumi.
12597,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"Ah, this isn't working. We can't just randomly wander the Spirit World, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her."
12598,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,We just need to employ the simply rules of tracking. First we locate her footprints ... then we follow them.
12599,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Kya,"Do you even know what spirit footprints look like? Do spirits even leave footprints? Face it, your tracking skills won't work in the Spirit World. Let me try something. Jinora is over there. I feel a lot of spiritual energy coming from that direction."
12600,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,We're in the Spirit World. There's spiritual energy in every direction.
12601,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,Enough! We can't do this by ourselves. We need a spirit guide.
12602,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"There. Spirit, hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance."
12603,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Dark Spider Spirit,"You dare wake me, human? Humans in the Spirit World belong in one place only."
12604,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,"Well, that didn't work. Now where are we?"
12605,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,We're completely lost.
12606,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Korra,No!
12607,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bolin,I don't know if we can win this fight.
12608,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Mako,"We don't need to win, we just need to stop Unalaq from getting back in the Spirit World."
12609,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"We're walking in circles, I've seen that same spirit mushroom five times."
12610,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,That's not the same mushroom.
12611,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Spirit mushroom,Yes I am.
12612,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,See? Even it knows we're lost.
12613,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,"Oh sure, listen to a fungus over your own brother."
12614,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,Mushroom? Is that you?
12615,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Spirit mushroom,"No, wasn't me."
12616,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,Iroh?!
12617,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,How ...? Where ...? It's been so long.
12618,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Iroh,Almost forty years. It's nice to see you again.
12619,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,How did you know we were here?
12620,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Iroh,"My friendly spirit fox told me you were lost, I came to show you the way out."
12621,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"Iroh, we are grateful, but we're not looking for the way out. We're looking for my daughter."
12622,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Iroh,"I'm sorry to hear that. But you shouldn't be here, Vaatu has escaped and darkness threatens to take over."
12623,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,I'm not leaving until I find Jinora.
12624,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Iroh,"I understand. But I beg you to be careful, if you travel too deep into the Spirit World, you could end up in a place where only the lost will ever find you."
12625,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,A place where only the lost can find you ...? That's it! I know where to find Jinora!
12626,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Korra,"I'm locking you away for another ten thousand years, Vaatu!"
12627,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bolin,Unalaq? Are you out there? He must've gone home?
12628,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Eska,"Hello, my feeble turtle duck."
12629,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Unalaq,Don't let them escape this time.
12630,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,Are you this is the best way to find Jinora?
12631,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,Trust me. Hey you! Spirit! Wake up!
12632,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Dark Spider Spirit,You again?!
12633,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Kya,I thought we were gonna be taken to a prison?
12634,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,This is a prison.
12635,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Dark Spider Spirit,Welcome to the Fog of Lost Souls. You will never escape.
12636,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Eska,Stop!
12637,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Korra,No!
12638,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Unalaq,We are now one! Now a new era for spirits and humans will begin! And I will lead them all as the new Avatar!
12639,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Korra,"Well I'm the old Avatar, and my era's not over yet!"
12640,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,What kind of prison doesn't have any bars or walls? We can walk right out of here.
12641,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"The Fog of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans. I read about that in ancient text. The fog is actually a spirit that infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories."
12642,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Kya,How long can we be trapped in here?
12643,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Zhao,I am Zhao the Conqueror. I am the Moon Slayer. I will capture the Avatar. I am Zhao the Conqueror. I am the Moon Slayer. I will capture the Avatar.
12644,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Kya,Hopefully we're not trapped in here as long as that guy.
12645,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Zhao,"You, you're ''him''. The last airbender!"
12646,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"Ah, no! Get off me!"
12647,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Zhao,You've grown. But I will still defeat you. Come back Avatar. Face me! I am Zhao the Conqueror. I will capture you! Victory will be mine!
12648,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"If we stay together, we'll find Jinora and make it out of this fog."
12649,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Unalaq,Give in. Your time is over!
12650,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Raava,"Korra, this fight is not over."
12651,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Korra,Raava.
12652,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Raava,Vaatu cannot win. Do not give in to ten thousand years of darkness. You are the Avatar.
12653,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Korra,You cannot win.
12654,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,Jinora! Jinora!
12655,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,Wait a second.
12656,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"What, do you hear something?"
12657,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,"Yes. They're all around us. The cannibals, they're everywhere."
12658,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"Bumi, you must focus your mind. Right now! There are no cannibals."
12659,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,"Yes, there are! They're gonna eat every last one of us!"
12660,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Kya,Who are you two?
12661,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"Kya, we're your brothers. You must remember, before the fog infects you."
12662,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Kya,"No, you're just a vision. I have no family. You can't tie me down."
12663,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,They're closing in! I gotta get out of here!
12664,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,No! Bumi! Kya! Come back!
12665,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Mako,"Please, let us out."
12666,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Desna,His grovelling is pathetic.
12667,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Eska,But I do enjoy the sweet scent of desperation.
12668,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Mako,"Come on, your dad has become an evil monster. He's gonna bring on eternal darkness. Why would you protect someone who doesn't care about you at all?"
12669,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Desna,Father was going to let me expire when we tried to open the northern portal. Perhaps we should rethink our position.
12670,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Mako,Yes!
12671,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Eska,No. Don't listen to him. His words are poisoning your mind. What's with this outburst of emotion?
12672,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bolin,"I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's just so sad that I'll never be with you again."
12673,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Eska,What? Explain yourself further.
12674,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bolin,"Eska, I've always loved you. And I always wanted to be with you. But now that the world is ending, I'm never gonna get that chance."
12675,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Eska,"We could have been together, but you left me at the altar."
12676,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bolin,"No, I was scared. I was scared of my true feelings for you. Gah, I should have never left you. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry that we'll never have the chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a ''big'' fire of love flames."
12677,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Eska,"You'll never defeat my father. But, should you survive, perhaps we could spend eternal darkness together."
12678,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Mako,Wow! That was the best acting I've ever seen. You completely fooled her.
12679,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bolin,"Yeah right, huh. That was acting."
12680,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Desna,They will certainly perish.
12681,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"You must stay focused. Remember who you are Tenzin. You are the son of Avatar Aang. You are the hope for future generations of airbenders. The fate of the world rests on your shoulders. But what if I fail? Then your father's hopes of the future dies with you. I can't fail. You will. Ah, stop it! I am the son of Avatar Aang. I am the hope for future generations of airbenders. I am the son of Avatar Aang."
12682,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Aang's image,"Hello, my son."
12683,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"Dad, I've failed you. I am no spiritual leader, and I've let the world down. I'll never be the man you were."
12684,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Aang's image,You are right. You are trying to hold on to a false perception of yourself. You are not me and you should not be me. You are Tenzin.
12685,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,I am not a reflection of my father. I am Tenzin. I am Tenzin!
12686,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,Jinora!
12687,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,Huh? What happened?
12688,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Kya,I think our brother saved us.
12689,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Jinora,Dad.
12690,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,You'll be okay sweetie. I'm here.
12691,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Jinora,What happened? The last thing I remembered was dark spirits taking me away.
12692,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,You were trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls. And I wasn't going to let you stay there.
12693,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Jinora,"I'm so happy to see you, Dad."
12694,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Mako and Bolin,Korra!
12695,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bolin,He's got the Light Spirit!
12696,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Jinora,The world is in trouble.
12697,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,What are you talking about? How do you know?
12698,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Jinora,I can feel it.
12699,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Bumi,What happened?
12700,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Jinora,It's Korra. This light spirit will guide you out of the Spirit World. I have to go help.
12701,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Tenzin,"Jinora, wait!"
12702,2,Darkness Falls,Spirits,2,86,Unavaatu,"Now, ten thousand years of darkness begins!"
12703,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Shiro Shinobi,"After fusing with Vaatu, Unalaq became a Dark Avatar and ripped Korra and Raava apart! By destroying Raava, Unalaq and Vaatu transformed into the most powerful dark spirit that's ever lived. Tenzin managed to free Jinora from the Fog of Lost Souls, but her spiritual quest isn't over yet. Can anyone save the world from eternal darkness?"
12704,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Ikki,Oooo ... Pretty.
12705,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Raiko,"General Iroh, are your ships in position?"
12706,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Iroh,"Yes, Mr. President. But I need to know what kind of enemy we're dealing with."
12707,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Unavaatu,It's time to take back the physical world.
12708,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Iroh,Fire!
12709,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Meelo,Monster attack!
12710,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Kya,They're gonna be all right. But I need to get them into some spirit water. Right away.
12711,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,Thank goodness you're all okay.
12712,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Did you find Jinora?
12713,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,She was right.
12714,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,Were you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?
12715,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"No. They fused, then Vaatu ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her. Vaatu won."
12716,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bolin,"No. I am too young to live through ten thousand years of darkness. Korra, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?"
12717,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"When Vaatu destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too."
12718,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"If that's true, then-"
12719,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"The cycle is over. I'm the last Avatar. I'm so sorry, Tenzin."
12720,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Kya,"She needs you now, more than ever."
12721,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Raiko,It's going to destroy the entire city.
12722,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Lin,We're going down!
12723,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Shiro Shinobi,"It's pandemonium in the streets! Giant vines are destroying everything. This is Shiro Shinobi, signing off!"
12724,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Varrick,"Zhu Li, commence ""Operation Winged Freedom"". Do the thing!"
12725,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"The other Avatars may not be able to help you anymore, but, perhaps I can."
12726,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,No one can help me now.
12727,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,I know I haven't been the best mentor to you. But I realized it was because I had a lot of spiritual growth to do myself. There may still be a way for you to stop Vaatu.
12728,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,How?
12729,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"Let go of your attachment to who you think you are, and connect with your inner spirit."
12730,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Haven't you heard anything I said? Raava is gone. I'm not connected to her spirit anymore.
12731,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"I'm not talking about Raava. Raava is not who you are. Come with me, I need to show you something."
12732,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Why are you showing me Vaatu's prison?
12733,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,Because this tree had a history long before it held Vaatu. This is the Tree of Time. And the legends say its roots bind the spirit and physical worlds together.
12734,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"And, you think this tree can help me somehow?"
12735,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"Yes. I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe."
12736,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,These are my memories.
12737,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"The Tree of Time remembers all. Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit. You have always been strong, unyielding, fearless."
12738,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Avatar Wan.
12739,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"Before he fused with Raava, Wan was just a regular person."
12740,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"But, he was brave, and ... smart, and always wanted to defend the helpless."
12741,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"That's right. He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was. He wasn't defined by Raava anymore than you are."
12742,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Everyone in Republic City is in danger.
12743,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"You have to help them, Korra."
12744,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,How? We're half-way around the world.
12745,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"Do as the ancients once did. Connect to the cosmic energy of the universe. Don't bend the elements, but the energy within yourself."
12746,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,You really think I can do this?
12747,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,I have no doubt.
12748,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Thank you for not giving up on me.
12749,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,I'm proud of you.
12750,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Wan,"If you and Vaatu have the same fight every ten thousand years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?"
12751,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Raava,"He cannot destroy light, anymore than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other."
12752,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Unavaatu,Find the light in the dark.
12753,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bumi,Uhhh ... what did you say to her exactly?
12754,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Ikki,Korra's back!
12755,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Meelo,And she's a blue giant!
12756,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Unavaatu,You're looking for something that is gone. Raava has been destroyed. And soon you will be too!
12757,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,They're coming for Korra!
12758,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Eska,Leave my Bolin alone!
12759,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Desna,I am so done with spirits.
12760,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bolin,Eska! I love you! Let's face the end of the world together!
12761,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Eska,You're so romantic.
12762,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Unavaatu,"With you out of the way, I will be the one true Avatar."
12763,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Ikki,"Mommy, it's Jinora. She's ... beautiful."
12764,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Unavaatu,No!
12765,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Raava!
12766,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Unavaatu,No!
12767,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Go in peace.
12768,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Raava,Harmonic Convergence is nearly over. We must return to the Spirit World so we can fuse once again.
12769,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Jinora,"I'll see you soon, Dad."
12770,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Jinora,"Gran-Gran, I missed you."
12771,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Asami,What about Korra and the others?
12772,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Jinora,"Don't worry, they're all right. Korra saved the world."
12773,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,The Avatar Spirit has returned.
12774,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,It's over.
12775,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,I don't even know what to say.
12776,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,You were amazing.
12777,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bolin,"And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow! I just wished Varrick was here to film it! It would be the greatest mover ever. After the Nuktuk chronicles of course."
12778,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,I'm sorry about your father. But he was already fused with Vaatu. I couldn't save him.
12779,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Eska,It seems cousin Korra is under the impression we're saddened by our father's demise.
12780,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Desna,"But I will not miss him at all. In the end, he became a deplorable man."
12781,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Eska,Agreed. But how will we explain this to mother?
12782,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bolin,"So, I was thinking. I'm not really a fan of a long-distance relationship thing, so how about you move to Republic City with me."
12783,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Eska,I do not think it will be possible.
12784,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bolin,Okay. Desna can come too.
12785,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Eska,"I will not be joining you, Bolin. Desna and I must return home."
12786,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bolin,But you said-
12787,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Eska,Eternal darkness was upon us. I became caught up in the moment.
12788,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bolin,Yeah. I guess I did too.
12789,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Eska,"But, you will always hold the special place in the organ that pumps my blood. I will remember you fondly. My turtle duck."
12790,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bumi,"Bum-Ju, you're okay. I missed you, little buddy."
12791,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"Now that you're bonded with Raava once again, are you also reconnected with your past lives?"
12792,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"No. I think that link is gone, forever."
12793,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"I see. Why don't you close the portals, and we'll go home."
12794,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Maybe I shouldn't.
12795,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,What do you mean?
12796,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds? What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals? What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart? Well, what do you think I should do?"
12797,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Tenzin,"I think you should trust your instincts. There is nothing else I can teach you. You are the Avatar. Whatever your decision, I support you."
12798,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,"Hey, can we talk?"
12799,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Of course.
12800,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,"There's something I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had. I know I said it wasn't that bad, but, that's not exactly true. I, um ... I-I broke up with you."
12801,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,I remember.
12802,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,"But, I thought you said you lost part of your memory."
12803,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"I did, but being inside the Tree of Time brought it back. I'm sorry for blowing up at you."
12804,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,That's okay. I think we've both said things that we regret.
12805,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?
12806,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,"I know I should have, but ... I didn't wanna hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the break-up too."
12807,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,I think we both know that this. Us? Doesn't work.
12808,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,You're right.
12809,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,It's over. For real this time.
12810,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Mako,"I'll always love you, Korra."
12811,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,And I'll always love you.
12812,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Bolin,You want a hug?
12813,2,Light in the Dark,Spirits,2,87,Korra,"The war of the Water Tribes is over. Unalaq has been defeated, and the Northern fleet is returning home. The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent, and the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new chief! I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path. So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open. Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World, and spirits will be free to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must learn to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy. I can feel it. Things will never be the same again. We're entering a New Age."
12814,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Shiro Shinobi,"The world has entered a new age. Harmonic Convergence created an energy shift the likes of which has never been felt before. And after two weeks, Republic City continues to recover from Korra's epic battle with UnaVaatu. Vines have sprouted up all over, creating pockets of wilds the spirits have come to call home. What other changes are in store for our city?"
12815,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,"Come back, Bum-Ju! If you don't want to wear the sweater I made you, that's fine. I'm sorry I got mad! Bum-Ju, I'm running out of tree. Can we go down now? Ahhh! Bum-Ju, a little help!."
12816,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,"Look, I'm airbending! Ah! Ow, that still hurt a lot."
12817,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,How are we ever gonna clear away all these vines?
12818,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Ugh, I don't get it. I can vanquish Vaatu but not a bunch of stupid vines?"
12819,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,I'm sure you'll find a way.
12820,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Jinora,Why do you want to get rid of them? You changed the world. We're connected with the spirits again. The wilds are their home.
12821,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,I don't think that the people who used to live here are as excited about it as you are.
12822,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,I gotta go face the press and tell them I ''still'' don't have a way to get rid of the vines. This should be fun.
12823,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Raiko,I'm not concerned with snappy put-downs in the press. I'm facing this calamity just like every other citizen. There's a tree growing right through my office. You think I'm not doing everything I can to get rid of it?
12824,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Reporters,"Avatar Korra, few questions please."
12825,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Listen, I've been trying everything I can think of to get rid of these vines, but-"
12826,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Look, Harmonic Convergence was just a couple weeks ago. I just needed a little more time to get everything back to normal."
12827,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Raiko,"The Avatar has put us all in a very difficult position, but my administration-"
12828,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I put you in a difficult position by fighting the giant force of pure evil that was going to destroy the whole world? Maybe your administration could have handled that."
12829,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Lin,"That's all, no more questions."
12830,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,This is a disaster.
12831,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,"Don't worry, we'll figure something out."
12832,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,Easy for you to say. You don't have my poll numbers. Eight percent approval? Who are they asking?
12833,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,You can't take that to heart. People are just frustrated.
12834,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,I don't blame them. I should be able to fix this. I'm the Avatar.
12835,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,You're not gonna believe what just happened. Where's your father?
12836,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Ikki,'''Dad!'''
12837,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,What is it? What's wrong?
12838,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,"The most amazing, wondrous, fantastical thing just occurred. Okay, Bum-Ju and I had a little fight. I made him this sweater, and he didn't seem to like it, and I'll admit, it might need work, but it was my first attempt at knitting, so I was a little hurt."
12839,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"Hilarious. Time for dinner, everyone."
12840,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,"No, check this out. I can airbend. Yeah wait, seriously, I was doing it. No hold on, I just uh, maybe if I- No. I swear, I'm not making it up."
12841,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,Stop waving your arms around at the table. It's not funny anymore.
12842,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,It's not a joke.
12843,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,What's up with him?
12844,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bolin,"Bumi says he airbended earlier, but he can't now. Oh, and I guess he's not very good at knitting either. I gotta say, I ''love'' being a part of this family. You got the grumpy dad, the wacky uncle, the put-upon mom, ''crazy'' kids. Well, that's just great."
12845,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,Where's Mako?
12846,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bolin,"Oh, you mean the brooding teenager? He's staying in the police station."
12847,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,''Still''?
12848,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bolin,"I told him Tenzin invited us to stay here since our apartment is a vine habitat now, but, he said he had to focus on work."
12849,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,"Oh, did you see that? I think the napkin moved."
12850,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Kya,You blew on it.
12851,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,"Wait! Maybe I can only do it when my life is in danger. Bolin, bend a giant boulder at me."
12852,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bolin,"Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea."
12853,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Pema,"If you're going to be bending giant boulders, you can do it outside."
12854,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,No one is bending giant boulders!
12855,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Meelo,"Look alive, Uncle Bumi!"
12856,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,I told you!
12857,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,''Unbelievable''. You're actually an airbender.
12858,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,"Wait 'till I tell Mom, she's gonna love this."
12859,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,"Ow! Police. He what? Slow down. Okay, I'm on my way."
12860,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,What the heck did all this?
12861,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Shopkeeper,It was my brother. He's out of control.
12862,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,"Okay, just tell me what happened."
12863,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Shopkeeper,"We were arguing about the books, and Daw was yelling at me. And all of a sudden, things started flying around. He was creating this storm, like-"
12864,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,Like what?
12865,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Shopkeeper,"Well, like he was airbending."
12866,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,"Sir, that's impossible. There are only five airbenders in the entire world, and, your brother is not one of them."
12867,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Shopkeeper,"I know what I saw. He was freaking out yelling: ""What's happening to me?!"" Then, he ran into the back room and locked himself in."
12868,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,Police. Open up.
12869,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,Go away!
12870,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,"Get out here, sir, or I'm knocking this door down. One, two--"
12871,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,I'm so sorry!
12872,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Shopkeeper,I told you. Airbending!
12873,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,"Ugh, I can't figure this thing out."
12874,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,Do you think being in the Spirit World during Harmonic Convergence could have given him bending?
12875,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,I suppose it's ''possible''.
12876,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Ikki,Maybe Uncle Bumi is just a late bloomer.
12877,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Kya,I have been noticing a change in your aura lately.
12878,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bumi,And you didn't tell me?
12879,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Lin,Invisible spirit monster attack?
12880,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"Lin, you won't believe this. Bumi just started airbending."
12881,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Lin,I'm afraid he's not the only one.
12882,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin and Korra,What?
12883,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,I got a call last night. About a guy who just started ''airbending'' out of nowhere.
12884,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,You mean there's another one? Where is he now?
12885,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,He ... blew a door down on me and got away. We got an all-points bulletin out on him right now.
12886,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Wait, we'll help you look for him. Where should we start?"
12887,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,"Oh, well, y'know, you should leave it with the police. It's ... police business. Y'know. It's um ... official."
12888,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Okay. How are you doing? You know, you're welcome to stay here instead of sleeping at the police station."
12889,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Mako,"No, I'm fine. I should just, get going. So, as you were ladies."
12890,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,This is so exciting! New airbenders in the city. I bet we can find that guy before Mako does. You know I'm not very good at this.
12891,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,"You're the Avatar, master of all the elements. You should know how to drive. Besides, it's relaxing. Clutch! Clutch! That's the brake. Let's try again. You ready?"
12892,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,How long do you think talking to Mako is gonna be like pulling teeth?
12893,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,"Well, Mako has never been the most ... ""in touch with his feelings"" guy, but it'll get better eventually."
12894,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"So, when I was gone, did he tell you that we broke up?"
12895,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,Yeah ... we all knew. Sorry.
12896,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,That's pretty embarrassing.
12897,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,"Actually, I need to tell you something about that, and I should have told you this sooner, but ... while you were gone ... I ... kind of ... kissed him. I'm sorry."
12898,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,No wonder he's so nervous around us!
12899,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,You're not mad?
12900,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"No! I mean, I kissed Mako when he was going out with you, so ..."
12901,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,You what?
12902,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,I'm so sorry! I thought you knew!
12903,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,I'm just kidding. I knew a long time ago.
12904,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Well, whatever happened with Mako, I'm glad it hasn't come between us. I've never had a girlfriend to hang out with and talk to before, except for Naga. This is nice."
12905,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,Vine! Vine!
12906,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Fruithog Spirit,Hey! Watch where you're going!
12907,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,What are you doing living in the middle of the road in the first place?!
12908,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Look, I don't have anything against spirits, but these vines are causing major problems all over the city!"
12909,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Fruithog Spirit,"Spirits, vines. We're all the same. Seems like the Avatar would know that."
12910,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Asami,"Korra, you okay?"
12911,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,I think that spirit just gave me an idea how to get rid of these vines ... But I'm gonna need a lot of water.
12912,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"It's like a dream, Dad. After a hundred and seventy years, new airbenders."
12913,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Ikki,"Dad. When that new guy's airbending, does that make him our brother?"
12914,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"Well, in a way, all airbenders are our family."
12915,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Ikki,Does that mean I have to share my room? Because I ''like'' my personal space.
12916,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,Of course not. But we might have to get used to not being the ''only'' airbenders around anymore.
12917,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Meelo,I hope we have enough for an ''army''. I want to be Commander like Uncle Bumi.
12918,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Jinora,"Air Nomads don't have armies, Meelo."
12919,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"But maybe, there will be enough to fill the temples again."
12920,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Jinora,"What's wrong, Daddy?"
12921,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,I just wish your grandfather was here to see this.
12922,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Meelo,Will you be airbender President?
12923,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"No, but I think the new airbenders will need lots of help and guidance to understand what it means to be part of our nation. That's a big responsibility."
12924,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Meelo,"Don't worry dad, we'll help you."
12925,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,I know you will.
12926,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,I hope this works. What are you guys doing here?
12927,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Raiko,I was alerted that you had a new plan to wipe out these ''noxious'' weed. So I thought you'd want everyone to be here to watch.
12928,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,Go in peace.
12929,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,Look out!
12930,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Let's go, people! Hurry."
12931,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,Hang on.
12932,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bolin,I think that could've gone better.
12933,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,Can't talk. Meditating.
12934,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,You must be at the end of your rope. You hate meditating.
12935,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"I thought if I really tried I might be able to contact my past Avatars, someone who knows something to help me, but I can't. They're gone and I'm all alone. Did I ruin everything by leaving the spirit portals open?"
12936,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"You didn't ''ruin'' anything. You did what you thought was best for the world, and now things have changed. Change can be good or bad, depending on your point of view."
12937,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,I know the people's point of view. It's bad.
12938,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"You're not the President, Korra. Your job isn't to fix the daily problems of every person in Republic City. Your responsibility is to bring balance to the entire world, and that means no matter what you do, some people are not going to be happy about it."
12939,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,Right.
12940,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"On the other hand, some people will be very happy. Like me. What you did during Harmonic Convergence may have brought back the Air Nation, and that can only be good for restoring balance. That is the act of a great Avatar."
12941,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"It's scary. I have all this power and all these people depending on me, but I don't know what I am supposed to be doing half the time. It seems like I should be ... wiser."
12942,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"True wisdom begins when we accept things as they are. You've started a new age, Korra. There's no going back to the past."
12943,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bolin,"Mako called! The cops found a new airbender guy, but when they tried to bring him in, he ran away and climbed to the top of Kyoshi Bridge and won't come down. Ooh sorry, did I interrupt an Avatar wisdom session?"
12944,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Avatar wisdom is the thing of the past, Bolin. Come on."
12945,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Bolin,Oh okay. Is that a good thing?
12946,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,Depends who you ask.
12947,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Lin,"Come down immediately, or we will be forced to take action."
12948,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,Stay back! I'm dangerous.
12949,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,Sorry!
12950,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Don't panic, I'm just here to talk."
12951,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,"Please, I don't know what I'm doing and I don't want to hurt anyone."
12952,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Tell me about it. Rough day, huh? I'm having kind of a rough day myself. You mind if I sit down here?"
12953,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,Huh.
12954,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Look, I know you're scared. You've gone through a big change and its kind of my fault. But you're not alone, there are other airbenders and they want to help you. Actually, they are really excited to meet you."
12955,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,"I don't want to be an airbender. Please, you're the Avatar, make it stop. Ahh!"
12956,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"I'm sorry, I can't, but I promise you things will get better if you just give it a chance. Let me take you over to Air Temple Island and we can talk this through. Okay?"
12957,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,Oh! Ahh!
12958,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Daw, this is Tenzin. He is going to help you."
12959,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"It is absolutely my pleasure to meet you, Daw. I have never met a new airbender before. Well, at least not one whose diaper I didn't have to change."
12960,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Daw,"Actually, I just fell off a bridge so I could use a fresh diaper right about now."
12961,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Raiko,"So, is this the deal? We have crisis every other day now thanks to you."
12962,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Listen, I know you're having a tough time getting used to these changes and I'm sorry for that, but ''you'' and everyone else are going to have to learn live with it. The vines and the spirits are here to stay."
12963,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Raiko,"Well, you know who's not here to stay? You! I order you to leave this city. You've caused nothing but trouble since you arrived."
12964,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,"Don't worry, I was already leaving."
12965,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Korra,I can see my path now. There are new airbenders out there and I'm going to find them and rebuild the Air Nation.
12966,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Tenzin,"Don't think I'm not going with you. It's so exciting. Who knows who's out there now, discovering the gift of airbending for the first time?"
12967,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,White Lotus sentry,"You know the drill, Zaheer."
12968,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Zaheer,Of course.
12969,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,White Lotus sentry,Hope you still like rice.
12970,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Zaheer,"Have you ever read the poetry of the great airbending guru, Laghima?"
12971,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,White Lotus sentry,What?
12972,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Zaheer,"Guru Laghima lived four thousand years ago in the Northern Air Temple. It is said that he unlocked the secret of weightlessness and became untethered from the earth, living his final forty years without ever touching the ground."
12973,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,White Lotus sentry,Is that how you plan to escape? With something you picked up from an old airbender children's story?
12974,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Zaheer,"Like all great children's tales, it contains truth within the myth. Laghima once wrote: ""Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong."""
12975,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,White Lotus sentry,What's that supposed to mean?
12976,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Zaheer,"It means that when you base your expectations only on what you see, you blind yourself to the possibilities of a new reality."
12977,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Zaheer,"Uh, uh, uh. You wouldn't want to singe your friend, would you?"
12978,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,White Lotus sentry,How? You're not a ... bender.
12979,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Zaheer,Nature is constantly changing. Like the wind.
12980,2,A Breath of Fresh Air,Change,3,88,Zaheer,"Now you might want to ration that bowl of rice. You've got three weeks until the next shift change. It's the dawning of a new age. The end of the White Lotus, and soon, the end of the ''Avatar''."
12981,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Shiro Shinobi,"After a hundred and seventy years, there are new airbenders in the world and Bumi is one of them! So too is the mysterious Zaheer, who escaped from his prison thanks to his new ability. Now banished from Republic City, Korra made it her mission to find the new airbenders. Will she and Tenzin be able to bring back the Air Nation?"
12982,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Asami,Did someone order a fully equipped Future Industries airship?
12983,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,It's perfect! Thanks Asami.
12984,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Asami,"I figured if we're going to Ba Sing Se to search for airbenders, we should do it in style."
12985,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Meelo,"Yay, airship!"
12986,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ikki,I wanna see!
12987,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Meelo,"C'mon, Poki."
12988,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kya,"While you guys are gone, Pema and I will hold down the fort."
12989,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kya,Who's excited to spend some time with your Auntie Kya?
12990,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kya,Oh!
12991,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Pema,"Aw, he likes you."
12992,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Mako, I'm so glad you're here."
12993,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"Of course, Korra. Avatar. Avatar Korra. Once I received your message I proceeded to contact various locations within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by you, the Avatar."
12994,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Right, the Avatar thanks you for your loyal service. Did you find any more leads?"
12995,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,There are reports of airbenders popping up all over the Earth Kingdom. I marked the villages on this map. You guys can take it with you.
12996,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Actually, I was kind of hoping you could come, too."
12997,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"Really? Uh, it's probably better if I sit this one out."
12998,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"I know things have been weird between us since we broke up, but you're a part of Team Avatar, and we can't do this without you."
12999,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"I'm sorry, I can't."
13000,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Pema,"I'll miss you, sweetie."
13001,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"I'll miss you too. Once we find the airbenders, I'll send word. You can join us at the Northern Air Temple then."
13002,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ikki,Hey! How come Jinora gets to go with you but we don't? That's so not fair!
13003,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Meelo,Yeah! What this girl said! Not fair!
13004,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kya,"Because if airbenders show up here, they're gonna need some guidance from the two of you. It's a very important job."
13005,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ikki,"Really? Me, a teacher? Yay!"
13006,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Meelo,Those maggots will bow to me!
13007,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"Go easy on them, son."
13008,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Mako, wait a sec."
13009,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"Korra already asked, bro. I can't just leave Republic City. I have a life here, and a job."
13010,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,A life? You sleep under your desk. And what's a more important job than helping the Avatar rebuild an entire civilization?
13011,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,It's not just that. I feel like I've been drifting apart from everyone.
13012,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Well, drift back, we need you! C'mon Mako, we're going to Ba Sing Se, where Dad grew up. What if I meet our grandma for the very first time, and she asks me ""Where's your sweet brother?"" and I have to say ""I'm sorry, Grandma, he had some really important police paperwork to file"" and she starts to cry those grandma tears, and is like ""Mako! Why? Why? I can't go on, I ca--"" and then she dies."
13013,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"Okay, all right, I'll come with you. I guess I gotta call Beifong. She's not going to be happy."
13014,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Meelo,Bye! We'll miss you!
13015,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"As of now, these are the towns where we've gotten reports about airbenders. It looks like we can hit up most of them before we get to Ba Sing Se."
13016,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,We're going to bring the Air Nation back from the brink of extinction after nearly two hundred years.
13017,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"And it's all because of you, Korra."
13018,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,White Lotus sentry,Finally. Our shift change is here.
13019,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,White Lotus sentry,Hey! Where are the other guards?
13020,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,White Lotus sentry,Zaheer?!
13021,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Zaheer,"It's nice to see you again, Ghazan."
13022,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ghazan,Thanks for busting me out. Where did you pick up the new skills?
13023,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Zaheer,I have Harmonic Convergence to thank for that. I was given a gift. I believe it's a sign that our path is a righteous one.
13024,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Townsman,Avatar Korra! Oh it's such an honor to have you come to our humble village.
13025,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,Thanks.
13026,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"I hate to get down to business, but is the airbender here now?"
13027,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,I just want to say it's an honor to meet a fellow airbender.
13028,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kuon,"Oh, I still think of myself as a simple farmer. Who can airbend! Oh, I'm so sorry! I still don't have any control."
13029,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,No worries! I love pie. And so does Pabu.
13030,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now. Harmonic Convergence changed everything. You represent the future of a culture that is being reborn. You're going to help us rebuild the Air Nation."
13031,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kuon,I'm gonna do what now? The only thing I'm planning to rebuild is my barn.
13032,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,But you must come with us to the Northern Air Temple.
13033,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kuon,"Well, I can't do that. I have a family and a farm."
13034,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,Of course you can come. This is of the utmost importance. Your wife will understand.
13035,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kuon's wife,"Wait, what? No, I do not understand."
13036,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kuon's daughter,"Daddy, where are you going? Why does the bald man want to take you away?"
13037,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kuon's wife,"No one's going to take Daddy away, sweetheart."
13038,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Actually, this bald man does want to take him, but it's for an important cause. Your dad is an airbender, and he should learn about his culture."
13039,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kuon,"I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding. I'm not going with you. I might be able to airbend, but I'm no Air Nomad, I'm no monk."
13040,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Townsman,"Okay, maybe we should just have some dessert huh? Who's up for dessert?"
13041,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"Sir, you must understand, you're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about, skills you must master."
13042,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kuon,"You expect me to abandon my entire life? My family? No! No sir, I'm not going anywhere with you and I think it's best that you leave."
13043,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"In my head, I saw that playing out very differently."
13044,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Asami,Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder to convince him to join us.
13045,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,Or we could have thrown him in a potato sack and forced him into the ship.
13046,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bumi,That's how they got me to join the United Forces.
13047,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"No, we can't coerce people, or throw them in potato sacks. They must come freely. But not to worry, there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation is all about."
13048,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"When your son becomes a master, he'll have tattoos all over his body, just like me. There's nothing more nutritious than our vegetarian diet. I can tell that you're going to love wearing our ancient airbender robes. They're very breathable. You'll never have to worry about your worldly possessions again, because you won't have any. You'll get to shave your head. Your best friend will be a giant bison!"
13049,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"Ugh, I really thought I had that last guy. Who doesn't want a bison as their best friend?"
13050,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bumi,"It's okay Tenzin, I still want to be an airbender."
13051,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Okay, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding. It's time for a little tough love."
13052,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu's mother,"Oh, are you the Avatar? When my son got airbending, my husband and I were so happy. We thought this could open a lot of doors for him, maybe he could finally move out of the basement."
13053,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,How old is he?
13054,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu's mother,"He's twenty-two, and you know, still just to figuring his life out."
13055,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Well, I have a great opportunity for him. We're looking for airbenders to join us at the Northern Air Temple."
13056,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu's mother,"Ah, that sounds wonderful! I'll get him. Ryu! Get up here!"
13057,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Hi, I'm Korra."
13058,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,So you're like the Avatar or something. Big deal.
13059,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity."
13060,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,"Yeah, I heard you talking to my mom, and I'm not interested."
13061,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Well, you're gonna be interested."
13062,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,You're an airbender now and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world.
13063,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,"Whatever. I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know."
13064,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties."
13065,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,So? You don't have to.
13066,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Yes, I do have to."
13067,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,"No, you don't."
13068,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Yes, I do!"
13069,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,"No, you don't."
13070,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Well, if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos. Think about that! Is that what you want?"
13071,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,Maybe.
13072,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"No, it's not!"
13073,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,So what? Who cares?
13074,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,Everyone cares!
13075,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,I don't care.
13076,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Yes, you do!"
13077,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,"No, I don't."
13078,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Well, you're about to care, you little slacker, because you're coming with me!"
13079,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,"Stop pulling on my collar! You're stretching it out! Mom, are you just gonna let her take me?!"
13080,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu's mother,I think it's a great opportunity. Just try it for a week and see how it goes.
13081,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ryu,No! Let me go!
13082,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,That's it!
13083,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"Korra, enough! Let's get out of here!"
13084,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,So nice to meet you! Good luck with your son!
13085,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Ghazan,"Great to see you too, Ming-Hua."
13086,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Zaheer,We're getting her next.
13087,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"Well, I guess we should just go to Ba Sing Se and try our luck there."
13088,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,I don't know what to do. I just thought more people would be excited about coming with us.
13089,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bumi,"Well, maybe you gotta do more to get them excited. You need to add a little razzle-dazzle."
13090,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Yeah, razzle-dazzle! We could put on some sort of airbending street performance!"
13091,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bumi,"I was gonna say we could cover Tenzin's robe in sequins, but that's even better!"
13092,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"It sounds ridiculous, but it might work."
13093,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,I'm willing to try anything at this point.
13094,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,Yes! That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear!
13095,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Come one, come all to witness The Amazing Airbenders! The airbending show that will leave you breathless ... with wind! First up, the tattooed master himself, you know him as the son of Avatar Aang, he shaves every hair on his head, every single day! It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose, Tenzin!"
13096,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Now, now, ladies and gentleman, ladies and gentleman, please be quiet. I have some serious news. We've heard that an escaped firebending convict has been spotted near here. Now, I don't want to panic anyone, but if you see a firebender with a red scarf-"
13097,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Crowd member,I see him! He's right there!
13098,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"I am the escaped convict, and you will all reap my fire."
13099,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,Oh no! Who will help us?
13100,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,I will. With my airbending skills!
13101,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,Ah! Hey! Let me go! This is not what we rehearsed! Korra!
13102,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"With the power of airbending, even this beast can float! Like a feather. Look what can be done in only a few short weeks of practice!"
13103,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"No no, don't worry folks. She might be young, but she is in full control!"
13104,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Ladies and gentlemen, if you, or anyone you know is an airbender, please, send them our way! Master Tenzin and Avatar Korra would love to teach them all they know!"
13105,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,"Hey! Hello. If you're looking for airbenders, you just found one."
13106,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,I wanna join you guys.
13107,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,Get outta town!
13108,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"We got our first recruit. Just to be totally clear, we're going to be heading to Ba Sing Se, then the Northern Air Temple to live as nomads and rebuild the Air Nation. All that sound good to you?"
13109,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,"Yeah, Ba Sing Se, rebuild the temple, Air Nomad what-do-you-do, I'm in. Let's go right now."
13110,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"This is going to be so great! You going to love it, er ... ah ... real quick, what's your name?"
13111,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,Kai. So when do we hit the road?
13112,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"Hang on a second Kai, where are your parents? We can't have you come with us without their permission."
13113,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,My parents are ... gone.
13114,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,You're an orphan?
13115,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,"It happened about a year ago. My home town was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them. I was so scared, but they told me not to worry they would protect me, and they did. My parents saved me and the entire village, but they died in the fight. Mum and pap meant everything to me, they're were my whole life. Ever since then, I've been on the run. Those same outlaws are still after me."
13116,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore, right guys? Tell him."
13117,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,I'm so sorry about your parents. I know we could never replace them ... but we are here for you.
13118,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"We'll keep you safe, come on."
13119,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"When you board this airship, you're going to leave your old life behind and start a new path. That's big brother advice. Just think of me as your big brother."
13120,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,Guys! I think we got trouble.
13121,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Earth Kingdom sheriff,"Release the boy, or we'll take him by force."
13122,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,"The outlaws! They're here ... Uh, let's get out of here."
13123,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,We are not running away from anyone.
13124,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"If you want Kai, you'll have to go through me!"
13125,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,Your days of harassing an innocent boy is over. You outlaws are going to prison.
13126,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Earth Kingdom sheriff,"Outlaws? Innocent boy? I'm a sheriff and these are my deputies, and this kid is a thief. Whatever he told you was a lie, we've been chasing him for months."
13127,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,Where's Kai?
13128,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"Right here, I found him slipping away."
13129,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,I was just going to the bathroom.
13130,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,With your stash of gold?
13131,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,"I told you, I found this on the road."
13132,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,Enough with the lies kid. I want the truth.
13133,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Earth Kingdom sheriff,"The truth is, he's the outlaw. He spent an entire life in an orphanage, got adopted by a real nice family six months ago, and how did he repay them? By taking their entire life savings. We've been after him ever since."
13134,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,Is that true?
13135,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,"The person who stole that stuff was the old me. Once I got airbending, I changed. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like airbending choose me for a reason , like I'm a new person. I'm sorry! Please, you have to listen to me."
13136,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Are, are you taking him back to the orphanage?"
13137,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Earth Kingdom sheriff,"No, he's headed to jail."
13138,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"Wait! You've got the family's life savings, now let us take Kai."
13139,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,Do you really want our first member of the Air Nation to be a liar and a thief?
13140,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,"He just needs some guidance, Tenzin. Who better to give it to him than us?"
13141,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Earth Kingdom sheriff,Do you want this boy or not?
13142,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"Yes, you can release the boy into our custody."
13143,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,Thank you!
13144,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Korra,Don't make me regret it.
13145,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Bolin,"Welcome to the family, little bro."
13146,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Mako,"I just want you to know that I'm going to be watching you, kid. I know exactly what you're all about, 'cause I've been there. You don't have me fooled."
13147,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,"Woah! Hey, lighten up. I'm turning over a new leaf, making a change. Don't you worry about me."
13148,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Jinora,"Hi, I'm Jinora. If you need any help with airbending, I could show you what I know."
13149,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Kai,"Thanks, that's real nice of you."
13150,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Tenzin,"Jinora, we're leaving now."
13151,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,White Lotus sentry,"They came out of nowhere. I'm so sorry, Lord Zuko."
13152,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Zuko,How could you let this happen?
13153,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,White Lotus sentry,"They caught us by surprise, and Zaheer is an airbender now."
13154,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Zuko,"No! This can't be. Do you have any idea the power these criminals possess? Individually, they can take down any bender. Put them all together, they could take down the entire world. And now you're telling me that their leader is an airbender?"
13155,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,White Lotus sentry,We can track them.
13156,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Zuko,"We don't need to track them, I know exactly where they're going. Notify the new chiefs of the Northern Water Tribe that an attack on their prison is imminent, and send word to Lin Beifong in Republic City. The Avatar must be protected."
13157,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,White Lotus sentry,Where are you going?
13158,2,Rebirth,Change,3,89,Zuko,To stop them.
13159,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Shiro Shinobi,"The Air Nation has its first recruit. Team Avatar's search for new airbenders in the Earth Kingdom led them to Kai, an orphan with a shady past. Meanwhile, Lord Zuko is hot on the trail of three escaped criminals who pose a great threat to the Avatar. Unaware of the danger to her, Korra continues her mission to find more airbenders. Next stop, the walled city of Ba Sing Se."
13160,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Jinora,"Light on your feet, Uncle Bumi. Remember, you want to be quick and evasive."
13161,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bumi,"Don't worry about me, little lady. I've been in a scrap or two you know. Ha ha. Oh, you're just a youngster, so I'm gonna go easy on ya. Wouldn't want to hurt a kid ..."
13162,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bumi,Oh.
13163,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Jinora,"Uncle Bumi, you've got to work on your stance changes. Kai, that was just, really good."
13164,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Kai,"Thanks Jinora, you're a great teacher."
13165,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bumi,"Hmm, did I drop my wallet?"
13166,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bumi,"Give me that, you little thief!"
13167,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,It's so exciting to be on a diplomatic mission to Ba Sing Se. What's the Earth Queen like?
13168,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tenzin,"I've never met her, but I've heard she can be quite ... demanding."
13169,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"This is it, Mako! We made it! This is where Dad grew up! Come here! Look, look!"
13170,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,I wonder how many airbenders are down there.
13171,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"Uhh, the Lower Ring looks terrible."
13172,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Yeah, I can smell it from here. No wonder Dad left."
13173,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Hello, Middle Ring!"
13174,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Kai,Wow. Now this is more like it.
13175,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,"Avatar Korra, Master Tenzin, it is a pleasure to welcome you and your party to the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se. I'm Grand Secretariat Gun."
13176,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,Thank you.
13177,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Aah, it's got that Upper Ring smell."
13178,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,"Oh no, the queen hates animals. You'll have to get them out of sight."
13179,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Well, I can just stash Pabu in my shirt, these two are going to be a little tougher."
13180,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,"Come with me, hurry, I'll take you to your quarters."
13181,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,"Now, when you meet the queen make sure you bow low enough, that's very important, and don't look her in the eye, she can't stand that. If any food is served, don't eat before she eats. Well actually, I have to taste her food first, then she eats, then you can eat. Better yet, just don't eat."
13182,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,Seems like an awful lot of rules.
13183,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,"Oh, you have no idea. And I'm the one who gets in trouble when people don't follow them, so please, please for my sake try not to upset Her Majesty."
13184,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,Here we are.
13185,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Ooh, very swanky."
13186,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,"Avatar Korra, if you'll follow me. We don't want to keep Her Majesty waiting."
13187,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,"Your Majesty, may I present Avatar Korra."
13188,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"Well, actually Your Majesty, I was hoping you could ..."
13189,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"Well, I uh, I'm not sure what I can do about that."
13190,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"I'm very sorry for your troubles, but actually ..."
13191,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Jinora,"Hey, has anyone seen Kai?"
13192,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tenzin,Kai?
13193,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bumi,He's not over here.
13194,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Asami,I don't think I've seen him since we landed.
13195,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,I knew that kid was no good. He was just waiting for an opportunity to run away again.
13196,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Jinora,We have to find him.
13197,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,What's the point? He obviously doesn't care about us.
13198,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"But he's my new little brother. He's probably lost, and scared."
13199,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tenzin,"He is just a little boy, and he's our responsibility. Besides, he's the only airbender we've recruited so far, we can't lose him."
13200,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,Fine. Bolin and I will find him.
13201,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"I don't really have servants. But, Your Majesty, the reason for our visit is that we're trying to gather all of the new airbenders who are popping up in the Earth Kingdom, and we'd like your help finding the ones in Ba Sing Se."
13202,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,Before we left Republic City we got some reports.
13203,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"Oh, of course. What is it?"
13204,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"Yes, Your Majesty."
13205,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Kai, did you go fishing? You under the bridge?"
13206,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Kai,"Here, sir, let me help you."
13207,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Kai,"Yeah, that was really weird."
13208,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,Kai! Get back here!
13209,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Kai, it's us. Mako and Bolin, your new family."
13210,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Excuse me, coming through Pardon me. Carry on."
13211,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,What are you doing running around robbing people?
13212,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Kai,I was just practicing my airbending.
13213,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,Yeah right. Let's go. You're in big trouble.
13214,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,Hey!
13215,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,"Your little brother, huh?"
13216,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Yeah ... just a lovable little scamp, isn't he?"
13217,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,Reminds me of my little brother.
13218,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Train conductor,"Designated express line to the lower ring. Next up, Poh Kong Station."
13219,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,All right. Let's see if we can catch a train back to the Upper Ring.
13220,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Ticket master,Passports and tickets.
13221,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"We can pay, hold on. Where's my money? No, Kai wouldn't-- Aww, man."
13222,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Ticket master,"Step aside, beat it you two, before things get ugly."
13223,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,The bad news is we're stuck here. The good news is we can go the bathroom wherever we want.
13224,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Asami,Are you sure we shouldn't have brought more people to collect the tax money?
13225,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,There are royal guards waiting at the vault. I doubt anything will happen. I think Her Majesty likes ordering me around.
13226,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Ohh man, aww I slipped a disc sleeping here. It's been awhile since we spent the night in a trash pile. It's about how I remembered."
13227,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,I bet everyone's freaking out that we've been gone all night.
13228,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Waiter,"Your breakfast, Master Fong."
13229,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Kai,Keep the change. I love Ba Sing Se.
13230,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Fwoo, I'm getting really hungry. Haah, we might have to hustle up a little breakfast with the old, fruit stand scam. Come on. You remember how it goes, I push you into the stand, you scream. I pretend to faint."
13231,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,"I don't want any part of it. Besides, look at this fruit, it's disgusting. We don't want to steal this."
13232,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tu,"Hey, you trying to steal my fruit?"
13233,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,"No, I just said I don't want any of this rotten fruit."
13234,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tu,"Oh, you're too good for my fruit? This is the best fruit on the block."
13235,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,So you want me to steal it?
13236,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tu,"Just try me, buddy. Go ahead."
13237,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,I'm confused. Are we stealing the fruit or not?
13238,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tu,I knew it. Thieves!
13239,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,What's going on here?
13240,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tu,"Dad, these fruit thieves are insulting our fruit."
13241,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,Bolin? Mako?
13242,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,How do you know our names?
13243,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Yeah, I mean I'm famous so I get that, but how do you know his name?"
13244,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,"You look just like San. Tu, you'll never believe who these guys are. They're your cousins! My brother San's kids."
13245,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Desna,"Lord Zuko, Uncle, this is a surprise."
13246,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Eska,Finally something exciting happens. Ruling the tribe is so tedious.
13247,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Zuko,Then you should enjoy this. We need to check on a secret ice prison in the western tundra.
13248,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,"Your father sent us a letter years ago with your names, but that was the last we heard from him. Then we saw your pictures in the sports magazine with your bending team, and Bolin, we love those Nuktuk movers. They're hilarious!"
13249,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Yeah, they're not really comedies, but uh ..."
13250,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tu,"Yeah, I could probably be a pro-bender or an actor or something if I lived in a mansion in Republic City like you guys. You don't know what it's like on the streets. You got to be tough."
13251,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Oh, Mako and I grew up on the streets. We were homeless, then we were kinda in a gang, then we lived in a gym ..."
13252,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,"Hey everybody! Look who's here, San's kids: Mako and Bolin."
13253,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Male family member,No way.
13254,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Female family member,Come in.
13255,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Yin,Is it true? After all these years?
13256,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,"Boys, this is your grandmother, Yin."
13257,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Yin,"Aw, it is so wonderful to meet my long lost grandchildren Where is San and your mother?"
13258,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Wait, you mean you don't know?"
13259,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,"I'm sorry, they were killed when we were little."
13260,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,I don't like the looks of this. Let's hurry up and get out of here.
13261,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Royal Earth Kingdom guard,You here to pick up the tax shipment?
13262,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,Go ahead and load it on the airship.
13263,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Asami,So much for our escorts.
13264,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,Maybe we should have brought everybody else.
13265,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Barbarians,Woo hoo!
13266,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gombo,Step away from the gold ladies and you won't get hurt.
13267,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"Sorry to disappoint you, but we're taking this gold back to Ba Sing Se."
13268,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gombo,"Aww, we love gals with spirit, suit yourself."
13269,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gombo,"Retreat, retreat! You're on the wrong side of this fight, Avatar. That gold belongs to the people, not the Queen."
13270,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,Why do I get the feeling he's right?
13271,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Eska,Why didn't anyone tell us we have a secret prison we could have been throwing people in?
13272,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Desna,I'd like to put my tailor in here. He never gets my cuffs right. They're so ... crease-y.
13273,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Zuko,"We built this place secretly with your father to hold a very special prisoner. She's a powerful firebender named P'Li who can create explosions with her mind. Ironically, I hired a guy with a similar ability to kill the Avatar myself once. Didn't work."
13274,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Eska,Don't feel bad. I tried to kill Korra after she ruined my wedding. It happens.
13275,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tonraq,Let's just focus on keeping this woman in prison.
13276,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Zuko,The intense cold prevents her from firebending.
13277,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Desna,There's certainly no way anyone's breaking out of here.
13278,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Zuko,That's what we thought about the other three prisons.
13279,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,P'Li,There must be something exciting going on . No one interesting has visited me in thirteen years.
13280,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tonraq,Don't get used to it.
13281,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,P'Li,"He's out, isn't he? Mmm, I'm feeling warmer already ."
13282,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"This is so great! We never had a family before. Now we've got one, two, five ... eleven ... ... a big family! Yeah!"
13283,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,So why did Dad leave Ba Sing Se?
13284,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,"Oh, he always had big dreams. He couldn't wait to get out and see the world. Your grandfather thought it was ridiculous. He wanted San to stay home and work the fruit stand. But San was determined to leave, and they had a huge fight. And that was the last time they ever spoke. Oh, um ... sorry, Mom."
13285,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Yin,Come with me. I have something to show you.
13286,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Yin,"This is the only letter we ever got from San. It says he married a beautiful girl from the Fire Nation, and had two wonderful sons. He sent this picture of you all on his birthday."
13287,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,"Look, Mako! Dad's wearing your scarf!"
13288,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Yin,"I'm so sad that I never got to meet your mother, but you have her eyes. I know from looking at you two that she must have been a wonderful bride for my boy."
13289,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,Your Majesty. The Avatar has returned with the tax payments.
13290,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Gun,It's being done as we speak.
13291,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,"So now, Your Majesty, if I could start meeting some of the airbenders here in the city."
13292,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens for your stupid palaces and topiaries and then you just want to send me away? We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders! We know there are some here!
13293,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Korra,This isn't over! I'm going to find the airbenders!
13294,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,"You know, San would've been so proud of you guys! Traveling the world with the Avatar? He would've loved that!"
13295,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,We actually need to get back to the Avatar in the Upper Ring. We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders in Ba Sing Se.
13296,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,What? What happened?
13297,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Chow,"One of our neighbors started airbending about a week ago. A couple days later, two Dai Li agents come out of nowhere and snatch him up. No one's seen him since."
13298,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Tu,"They say the Earth Queen's locking all the airbenders up somewhere, and using them for experiments."
13299,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Yin,Tu! Don't talk like that about Her Majesty! Long may she reign.
13300,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Mako,We have to get back to the Upper Ring and tell Korra.
13301,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Bolin,I hope Kai is okay.
13302,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Kai,"Here, sir, let me help you."
13303,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Kai,Hey! What's going on? I didn't do anything! I'm with the Avatar.
13304,2,The Earth Queen,Change,3,90,Dai Li agent,"Welcome to Her Majesty's army, First Airbending Regiment. From now on, you live to fight for the Earth Queen."
13305,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Shiro Shinobi,"Airbenders are mysteriously disappearing in Ba Sing Se, including Kai. The Earth Queen denied any knowledge of the airbenders, but Korra refuse to give up her search. Meanwhile, Mako and Bolin met their long lost relatives, who told them that Dai Li agents have been rounding up airbenders for the queen's army. And at a prison in the north, Tonraq and Lord Zuko prepare for Zaheer's imminent attack."
13306,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tonraq,Did you see Zaheer?
13307,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Zuko,The only thing I saw was a snowstorm heading our way.
13308,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tonraq,"That's not a snowstorm, it's him!"
13309,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tonraq,"I put you away once, Zaheer, and I'm going to do it again!"
13310,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,P'Li,Ming-Hua.
13311,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,P'Li,We ''could'' have just taken the elevator. Show-off.
13312,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,P'Li,I've waited thirteen years to feel this warm.
13313,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,P'Li,I thought I'd never see you again.
13314,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Zaheer,I've never doubted it.
13315,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Ghazan,Really. Right now?
13316,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tu,I've got them. These passports should get you into the Upper Ring.
13317,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,"Awesome! Tu, you're the best cousin that I can have. And my other cousins as well. Yeah. Yeah, you're all the best."
13318,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,Thanks. I know this wasn't easy.
13319,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Yin,It's such a shame you two must leave so soon.
13320,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,"I wished we could stay. But if it's true the Earth Queen is forcing airbenders into her army, we have to do something about it."
13321,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Yin,I love you both. Come visit again.
13322,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,"We will, Grandma."
13323,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,"I love you too, Grandma. And Chow, and Tu, and Meng-Meng, and Chow Jr., there is Big Tee and Little Tee, and Medium Yu, and ... and ... and what was your name again?"
13324,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,I know that Earth Queen is lying to me! I can tell by that stupid little queenly smirk of hers! I can't believe I helped her. I should have known she was using me!
13325,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Asami,"Hey, I think I can use a break. You letting off steam is starting to, hurt. A lot."
13326,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Sorry.
13327,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Asami,Mako. Bolin. You're okay. Where have you been?
13328,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,We chased Kai. Train. Slipped away. Lower Ring. Slept in trash pile. Met our family. Grandma tears. Mako scarf. Earth Queen. Lying.
13329,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Asami,Can you interpret that?
13330,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,The Earth Queen's been secretly taking away airbenders and ''forcing'' them into her army.
13331,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"She ''was'' lying. I knew it! I swear, the next time I see her-"
13332,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Asami,It's the Queen.
13333,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,Quick! Pabu. Shirt. I know. Sorry. Kinda sweaty.
13334,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Gun,We've received word from the Yang Province. There have been reports of airbenders there.
13335,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Thank you! That is just the most wonderful news. Ever. Yay.
13336,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Gun,"N-no, Your Majesty. I would never allow an animal near you."
13337,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"Uhh, this evening? I'm not sure about leaving so soon-"
13338,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Asami,Because our airship is having engine trouble. It'll take me until tomorrow to finish the repairs.
13339,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Thanks for buying us some time.
13340,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,I can't believe the Earth Queen is conscripting airbenders.
13341,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Those people should not be forced to join an army!
13342,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bumi,"Well, technically, the Earth Queen has a right to conscript her citizens. What? It's true."
13343,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,"Guys, what if Kai was spotted airbending? He might have been taken too."
13344,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,"But, what if he was?"
13345,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"Don't worry, Jinora. We'll find him. We just need to figure out where to look."
13346,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,I bet they're under Lake Laogai. What? I've been reading some of Jinora's books. The old Dai Li agents used to have a secret fortress beneath the lake.
13347,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,"Mako's right! It's the perfect spot to hide airbenders, and I know how to check it out without being caught. I can project my spirit into it!"
13348,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bumi,"You mean that out-of-body thing you did to help giant, spirity Korra?"
13349,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,You can still do that?!
13350,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,"It's not as powerful as it was during Harmonic Convergence, but if I can get close enough, I think I can do it."
13351,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Let's go get Kai out. Let's get all the airbenders out.
13352,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Dai Li sergeant,You are the property of the Earth Kingdom. You will become the Earth Queen's elite fighting force and protect her at all cost. It is your duty to serve the Earth Queen.
13353,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Yung,Go easy on me! I'm not that good.
13354,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Dai Li sergeant,"Never show mercy! Now attack your opponent, and this time, like you mean it!"
13355,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,Sorry.
13356,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Dai Li sergeant,A soldier never apologizes to his enemy!
13357,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,I'm not a soldier!
13358,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Dai Li sergeant,You will be when I'm through with you.
13359,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,"If anything goes wrong, come back immediately."
13360,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,I will.
13361,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,What happened? What did you see?
13362,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,The airbenders aren't there! It's completely deserted.
13363,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,They're not down there?!
13364,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"Jinora, you've read all about Ba Sing Se. Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be?"
13365,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,There are just too many places. There has to be another way to locate them.
13366,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Maybe there is. How did you find me during Harmonic Convergence?
13367,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,I don't know. I just kind of focused on your energy. I think our spiritual connection led me to you.
13368,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Maybe you can find Kai the same way. I know you two have a connection.
13369,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,"What do you mean ""a connection""?"
13370,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,I don't know. Let me try.
13371,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Yung,Thanks.
13372,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Dai Li sergeant,"You again?! If you have time to help your friend, then you're not getting enough rocks for yourself!"
13373,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Dai Li sergeant,I guess you're not as good as you thought.
13374,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Dai Li sergeant,Throw him in the hole!
13375,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,Jinora?
13376,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,It worked!
13377,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,How are you here right now?
13378,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,"Shh, quiet. It's a high-level airbender move. With a little spiritual stuff thrown in."
13379,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,"At first, for a second there, I thought you were a ghost."
13380,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,It's good to see you. We've been looking for you and the other airbenders. We're going to get you all out of here. Where are we anyway?
13381,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,"Underground somewhere. Other than that, I don't have a clue."
13382,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,I'll figure it out. Don't worry.
13383,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,Jinora! Thanks.
13384,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,The Earth Queen's Temple!
13385,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,I can't believe Miss Queeny Smug Face had them right under our noses the whole time!
13386,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,We have to get into that compound tonight and get those airbenders out.
13387,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bumi,"All right. We go in under the cover of darkness: two small insertion teams and a third on the outside. Then all we'll need is twelve tons of blasting jelly, a medium-sized bulldozer and ... does anyone have a badgermole that knows Morse code?"
13388,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,
13389,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Asami,"Oh great, not the Queen again."
13390,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"Everyone, act natural. And Bolin -"
13391,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,"I'm on it! What? Hey, I'm not sweaty this time!"
13392,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,Lin? What are you doing here?
13393,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,We need to get Korra out of here immediately. Her life's in danger.
13394,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,What?! What's going on?
13395,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,I just got word from Lord Zuko and Tonraq.
13396,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Why is Lord Zuko with my dad?
13397,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,Zaheer and the others have escaped.
13398,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,How is that possible?
13399,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,Because Zaheer is an airbender now.
13400,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,No ...
13401,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"All right, hold on! Will you quit ignoring me and tell me what's going on? Who's Zaheer? Why is my life in danger?"
13402,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,"Shortly after we found out you were the Avatar, Zaheer and three others attempted to kidnap you. Luckily, your father, Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka and I were there to stop them. We apprehended the criminals and locked them away in prisons designed to impair their abilities."
13403,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,So ''that's'' why you and my dad sheltered me away.
13404,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,It was for your own safety.
13405,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,Why were they trying to kidnap Korra?
13406,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,"We spent thirteen years interrogating them, but they never broke. To this day, no one knows what their motive was. Now we need to get you back to Republic City, where I can protect you."
13407,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,No ... I'm not running.
13408,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,"Korra, you don't understand. These criminals are like nothing you've ever faced before."
13409,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"Look, I'm not a little kid anymore. You don't need to protect me. I came here for one thing: to find airbenders. And I'm not leaving without them."
13410,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,Fine. Let's get them and get out of here. Where are they?
13411,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"In a military compound, and we're busting them out."
13412,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,Hi.
13413,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,I'm not alone.
13414,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,"Bumi and Korra, come with me to find the airbenders. You three, find Kai. We'll meet on the surface shortly. Radio us if anything goes wrong."
13415,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Yung,What's going on? Who are you?
13416,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"I'm the Avatar, and I'm getting you all out of here."
13417,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,"Everyone, please! You must stay calm and quiet if we want this to work."
13418,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Yung,What to work? We're sneaking out?
13419,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"Yes, and we must leave now."
13420,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,We're going to get you away from the Earth Queen and out of the city.
13421,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Yung,There's an airbender that's not here. His name is Kai. We need to get him.
13422,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,We're already taking care of it.
13423,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,What? Are you in trouble?
13424,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bumi,No! We've got the airbenders and we're headed out! No one likes code names anymore.
13425,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Lin,Copy that. Asami and I are on our way.
13426,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,Come on. We're getting you out.
13427,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,Whoa! Tenzin's not gonna be happy about this!
13428,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,Then don't tell him.
13429,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,How can I not? This is too juicy!
13430,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,"Thanks for coming to get me. I'm really sorry about stealing your wallets, and running away, and getting you stuck on that train."
13431,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,We can't stay mad at you.
13432,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Mako,"Yes, we can! I had a lot of money in that wallet!"
13433,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Jinora,"Guys, come on!"
13434,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Dai Li sergeant,Deserting Her Majesty's army is high treason. Punishable by death!
13435,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Come on! It's clear.
13436,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,These airbenders shouldn't be used as weapons! They have a right to choose their own paths.
13437,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,They're leaving with me!
13438,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bumi,Come on!
13439,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,I guess I am as good as I thought.
13440,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bumi,Everyone's in. Let's go!
13441,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,Oogi!
13442,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Where are the others?
13443,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,We need help!
13444,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Bolin,"Everybody, hang on."
13445,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Kai,"Whoa, that was awesome!"
13446,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,"I know that none of you chose to become airbenders. But now you do have a choice. We can relocate you somewhere safe, or you can come with me to the Northern Air Temple, to live in peace and train as Air Nomads. You are no longer anyone's property. What path you decide is up to you."
13447,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Yung,I want to go with you.
13448,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,Good luck at the Northern Air Temple. I'll send more airbenders your way when I find them.
13449,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,Be careful out there. Stay safe.
13450,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,"I'll try. Seems like wherever I go, I make a new enemy."
13451,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Tenzin,"But you made some new friends too. You did well, Korra."
13452,2,In Harm's Way,Change,3,91,Korra,This is only the beginning.
13453,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Shiro Shinobi,"Is there any place safe for the Avatar? First, President Raiko banished her from Republic City. Then the Earth Queen declared her an enemy of the Earth Kingdom after Korra rescued a group of airbenders in Ba Sing Se. And Korra has learned that Zaheer and his fellow criminals are after her. With Tenzin busy with bringing the new recruits to the Northern Air Temple, Korra's protection rests in Beifong's hands."
13454,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,"While you're playing fetch, four of the most dangerous criminals are hunting you down. We should get moving."
13455,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Relax, we just got here. Besides, no one knows where I am except us. I think she wants you to throw it for her."
13456,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,"I'll pass, thanks."
13457,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Asami,We just got a call from the radio about another airbender.
13458,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Finally! Where are they?
13459,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Mako,"A city called Zaofu, the home of the Metal Clan."
13460,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,You know the place?
13461,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Uhh ... Never been there. But I don't want you going there. I would rest a lot easier if you were back at Republic City.
13462,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Sorry, if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we are going next."
13463,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Wow! Wow! Wow! An entire city made of metal! Wohoho, you should feel right at home, Beifong."
13464,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Hmm ...
13465,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,Yeah!
13466,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Asami,Aren't you coming?
13467,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,What's there to see? It's metal. Big whoop. Just find the airbender and let's get moving. Don't tell anyone I'm here.
13468,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Why not?
13469,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,I don't need to explain myself to you. Just do what I say.
13470,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Fine. You got it, Chief Crankypants."
13471,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,Avatar Korra. It is an honor to meet you. My name is Aiwei.
13472,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Thanks for having us.
13473,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,Is this everyone?
13474,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Yup. Just us. So, can I meet the new airbender?"
13475,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,"Of course, right this way."
13476,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Ikki,"And this is the Air Acolyte dining hall where everyone eats. And this is Daw. He's a new airbender too, like you guys."
13477,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Daw,It's so nice to meet you. How exciting. New friends.
13478,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,"Excuse me, hello? My name is Yorru. I heard this is the place to come for if you're a new airbender."
13479,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Meelo,"You got that right, stranger."
13480,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,"Well, a couple of weeks ago, I woke up and suddenly I can do this."
13481,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Ikki,Mom! Aunt Kya! We got another one!
13482,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,"That statue honors the first metalbender, Toph Beifong, who expanded the possibilities of what benders were capable of. Here, everyone is encouraged to reach his, or her, highest potential."
13483,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,Does Toph live here? Are we going to get to meet her?
13484,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,"I'm afraid not. She would visit from time to time, but years ago she left to wander the world, in search of enlightenment. No one has seen her since."
13485,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Wow. Is this where the airbender lives?
13486,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,"Yes. But first, her mother wants to meet you."
13487,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Is this some kind of combat training?
13488,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,"Not exactly, they are rehearsing for a dance premiere next month."
13489,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,That's it for today everyone.
13490,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,"Allow me to introduce the matriarch of the Metal Clan, Suyin."
13491,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Please call me Su. Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra. And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami."
13492,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Mako,You've done your research.
13493,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,I make it my business to know who's visiting my city.
13494,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"So, you're a dancer."
13495,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Dancer. Leader. Wife. Mother. Collector of rare meteorites. You'll find people here have many skills and interests. Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you?"
13496,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"What? I, uh, I didn't. I mean ..."
13497,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,Oh ...
13498,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,How did you know I was lying?
13499,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Aiwei,"I'm a truth seer. When people lie, their heart rate and breathing increase. I can sense the most subtle of changes."
13500,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Thanks to Aiwei, there are no secrets in our city."
13501,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,We came with Republic City's Chief of Police. She didn't want anyone to know she was here. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
13502,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Lin's here? Well, I would love to say hello."
13503,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Wait, you two know each other?"
13504,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"You're joking, right? Lin never told you about me."
13505,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,No. Why would she?
13506,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,I'm Lin's sister.
13507,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,I found out why you're so against coming here. Why didn't you ever tell me you had a sister?
13508,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,''Half''-sister.
13509,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Same mom, different dads, so what? We're blood, Lin, and after thirty years, the least you could do is say ""hello""."
13510,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,I have ''nothing'' to say to you.
13511,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,You two haven't spoken in ''thirty'' years? How come?
13512,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Ask her, I've tried."
13513,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,"Oh, don't put that on me. You're the one who tore our family apart."
13514,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,And you've done a bang up job keeping it that way.
13515,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,"You haven't changed one bit, have you?"
13516,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Look, we can stay here arguing about the past all day, but that's not reason the Avatar came here. My daughter is thrilled to meet you."
13517,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Lin, your niece is the new airbender! Isn't that amazing?"
13518,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Yeah. Terrific.
13519,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Those are my two youngest, Wei and Wing. They're playing a game called Power Disc. They invented it all on their own."
13520,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Oh, nice power, Wei."
13521,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Wei,Ha! Wing goes down!
13522,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"I'm so proud of those two. Huan, I'd like you to meet the Avatar and her friends. And your Aunt Lin."
13523,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Nice to meet you.
13524,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Huan,Hey.
13525,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Wow, that's a really nice ... banana? Yes, very, very lifelike."
13526,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Oh, yeah, no, uh, I can, I can totally see that. I can, oh, let me stand here. Yes, I can see that now. Yes. Thank you. Banana. I mean, that's a banana right?"
13527,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"And this is my daughter, Opal."
13528,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,"Wow, Avatar Korra. I can't believe you're here. You are so amazing."
13529,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"It's great to meet you, Opal."
13530,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,Opal. That's a beautiful name.
13531,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,Thanks.
13532,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,I'm Bolin.
13533,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,"Opal. But, uh, you already knew that."
13534,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Great. We've found the airbender. Let's take her back to the airship and get out of here.
13535,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,And the woman apparently trying to abduct you is your aunt Lin.
13536,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,Really? I've always wanted to meet you. My mom has told so many stories about you.
13537,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,I'm sure she has.
13538,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,So I've set all of you up in the guesthouses while Korra trains Opal.
13539,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Oh, I'm sorry. But I was hoping she could train with the rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple."
13540,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,That sounds amazing.
13541,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,Nonsense. This is where Opal's home and family are. You can train her here.
13542,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,I guess I could help her get started.
13543,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Absolutely not! We're leaving.
13544,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,She's just a little worried because there's a bunch of crazy criminals after me.
13545,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"If you're concerned about security, don't be. This is the safest city in the world. Now I'll see you all at dinner. And come hungry. My chef will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth."
13546,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Why do you have such a problem with your sister? She seems nice. Come on, we can stay a little while."
13547,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Okay. Let's see what you've got.
13548,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,I'm not very good.
13549,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"That's okay. I've never been a teacher before, so we're in the same boat. You'd want to keep your elbows in, torso straight, feet just skimming the ground. Why don't you try it with me?"
13550,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Woah. You're a natural.
13551,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,You really think so? Thanks.
13552,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Meelo,You call yourself an airbender? Disgraceful!
13553,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Meelo,Be the leaf!
13554,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Daw,"But, I don't even know what that means."
13555,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Meelo,"Now, that man is a leaf."
13556,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,A student is only as good as his master.
13557,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Kya,Great news! I just got a message from Tenzin. He's with a whole group of other airbenders at the Northern Temple and he wants all of you to join them. We leave first thing in the morning.
13558,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,And the Avatar is with him?
13559,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Kya,No. Apparently she had to split off from Tenzin.
13560,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,That's unfortunate. I was really looking forward to meeting her.
13561,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Chef,"Tonight, for your dining pleasure, I present a seared wild Kyoshi elephant koi, paired with a ginger-infused pea tendril and hibiscus root salad."
13562,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,Stunning.
13563,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Baatar,"Sorry, dear, I'm going to have to take dinner to my office. I just had a major breakthrough on the tram station remodel."
13564,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Well, don't let me stand away an inspiration."
13565,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Baatar,You're the best!
13566,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"That was my brilliant architect of a husband, Baatar, and our oldest son. He engineers all my husband's projects."
13567,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Five kids. What a nightmare.
13568,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"No, no. My children are a blessing."
13569,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,"Yeah, mom used to say that too, but she never meant it."
13570,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Mmmm. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical when he said ""pea tendrils"", but this is delicious."
13571,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,"I know, right. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal in my life."
13572,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Oh. I had plenty when Mako and I were living in the streets. I mean, you'd be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be."
13573,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,I'm sorry. I didn't know.
13574,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"No, no, it's okay, that's all in the past. Things are great now. I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, became ''a mover star'', and now, I'm helping the Avatar rebuild a whole nation."
13575,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,Wow. Your life sounds so exciting.
13576,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,How's your search for the new airbenders going?
13577,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Honestly, not great. We had to rescue a whole group of them from the Earth Queen."
13578,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Oh, she's horrible. She thinks she can just do whatever she wants."
13579,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Sounds familiar.
13580,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,What?
13581,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Nothing.
13582,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"I mean, the idea of even having a queen is so outdated. Don't you agree, Korra?"
13583,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,I ... I haven't really thought about it too much.
13584,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Well, you should start. The world is evolving and the Earth Queen can evolve with it or step aside."
13585,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,"Hey, everyone. My little sister is an ''expert'' on world affairs now."
13586,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,You want to talk about what's really bugging you? Because ''I'm'' right here!
13587,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Varrick,"Sorry we're late, everyone."
13588,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,Varrick!
13589,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Asami,What are you doing here?
13590,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Varrick,"Great question, Asami. I mean, what are any of us doing here? Wow, food for thought. Any who, how's our company doing?"
13591,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Asami,You mean ''my'' company. Future Industries reverted back to me after ''you'' plotted to abduct the President.
13592,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Varrick,''Allegedly'' plotted to abduct the President. Never convicted.
13593,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Mako,"Uh, that's because you escaped prison."
13594,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Varrick,"No, the universe decided to set me free. So, I looked up my old friend Suyin here, pitched her a few ideas, and ''bam''! We're in business together."
13595,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,Varrick's heading up my new technology division.
13596,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Varrick,"I've seen the future, and the future is, ''magnets''! I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it. But that's not all, I'm-"
13597,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,"All right, enough! I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe and you're harboring a criminal?"
13598,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Ease out, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past, but that doesn't mean he should pay for it for the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate, but now he's a culinary master. People change."
13599,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,You haven't.
13600,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Lin!
13601,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Mako,"So, you and Opal seemed to hit it off dinner. I think she's really into you."
13602,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Yeah, I know. She's sweet and pretty and super nice. Too bad she's not my type."
13603,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Mako,"Right, I forgot. Your type is dumb mover star or psycho ice princess."
13604,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"You know, that really hurts a little bit. Right ... here. Maybe you're right, bro. Maybe Opal is Bolin material. Thanks. Yeah!"
13605,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"You know, before I built this city, there was nothing here. I wanted to make my mark on the world."
13606,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,It's amazing. Thank you for being so welcoming. And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting. Can I ask what happened with you two?
13607,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police. Because mom grew up in such a strict household, she gave us all the freedom in the world, hoping we'd figure out our own paths."
13608,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,That sounds like a good thing.
13609,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"And in a way it was. But we both ended up fighting for mom's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was ... more of a rebel. Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the world. I sailed the seas on a pirate ship, joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in a desert. It took me a while, but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family. So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband, and created a place I could truly call home."
13610,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,It sounds like you've created the perfect life here.
13611,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Suyin,"Almost. I've always wanted Lin to be a part of it, but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around."
13612,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Hey, lady. Wow, you really blowin' me away with your ''airbending''. Ahhh, woo-woosh, psst."
13613,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,Why are you acting weird?
13614,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,Why are ''you'' acting weird?
13615,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,I don't like how you're talking to me.
13616,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Look, I'm sorry. I just get really self-conscious when I know when a girl likes me, and I-I end up looking stupid."
13617,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,Who said I liked you?
13618,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,Oh no. But I though ... Mako said-
13619,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,"Just kidding. But, do me a favor and stop trying. Look, don't stop trying. Just stop trying so much. Just be yourself."
13620,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Bolin,"Huh. Be myself. Yeah, I guess I can give that a shot."
13621,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,"Oh, hey Korra."
13622,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,Can I steal you away from Bolin for a minute? I need you help with something.
13623,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,"""Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind."""
13624,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Ikki,What are you doing? No one's allowed in Daddy's study except Daddy.
13625,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.
13626,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Ikki,What were you reading?
13627,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,"A poem by Guru Laghima, the wisest airbender who ever lived."
13628,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Kya,"Ikki, you should be in bed. C'mon."
13629,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Ikki,Night.
13630,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,Good night.
13631,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Kya,You seem to know ''a lot'' about airbender history for someone who ''just'' got airbending.
13632,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,I've always admired the culture.
13633,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Kya,And you moved through those gates like a natural. Where did you say you were from?
13634,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,A small village up north. You've probably never heard of it.
13635,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Kya,Wait. Zaheer!
13636,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Kya,I need some help!
13637,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,White Lotus sentry,Hold it right there!
13638,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Zaheer,"Sorry, I won't be joining you at the Northern Air Temple. I'm afraid I have other plans."
13639,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Who is it?
13640,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Hey, it's me. I brought someone who wants to talk to you."
13641,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,You want to talk? Then talk.
13642,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,"I'm sorry being here has been so hard for you. When you showed up, I was so excited to get to know you. I heard so many great things about you from mom and Grandma Toph. So, I guess I was kind of sad you didn't want to know me. Believe me, I know my family can be a little crazy and overwhelming some times. But I would love it so much if you would be a part of it."
13643,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Get out.
13644,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Opal,"Sorry, did I say something wrong?"
13645,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,Get out!
13646,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,What's your problem? Don't get mad at Opal. I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in. But I guess I was wrong.
13647,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Lin,"Why don't you focus on fixing the world, and stop trying to fix my family?"
13648,2,The Metal Clan,Change,3,92,Korra,"Su's right. You're never going to change. You're always gonna be a bitter, lonely woman."
13649,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Shiro Shinobi,"Lin Beifong has a sister. After arriving in Zaofu, Korra met Opal, a new airbender whose mother is Lin's estranged half-sister. Suyin and her daughter welcomed Lin with open arms, but she wanted nothing to do with them. Meanwhile, Zaheer infiltrated Air Temple Island, looking for the Avatar. After battling with Kya, he escaped and is now a wanted man in Republic City."
13650,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Mako,"Hey, has anyone seen Chief Beifong?"
13651,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,I think she's still sulking in her room.
13652,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"I know she has a problem with me, but she had no right to yell at Opal last night. All set for your power disc game, guys?"
13653,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Wing,"Yeah, all set to kick Wei's butt."
13654,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Wei,I wanna power disc your face. You should go play with us.
13655,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,"Um. I don't think I'd be much competition, since I can't metalbend."
13656,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Really. Lin never offered to train you?
13657,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,"Nope. And I guessed I never thought to bring it up because I was learning to airbend, then there was the pro-bending, then I got tied up fighting Equalists. It was a busy few months."
13658,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Well, it's probably for the best. I'm sure Lin would be a horrible teacher. As the Avatar, you should have mastery over all the elements. I'd be happy to show you the basics."
13659,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,Really? That would be great!
13660,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,"You should try it, too."
13661,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Okay, Earth Guy. Well, let me know if you change your mind."
13662,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Varrick,"It worked! Zhu Li, mark it down. Magnet suit test successful. Power down. On to phase two: Zhu Li cleans up this mess."
13663,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,What do you two think you're doing?! Get back to work!
13664,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Aiwei,Is everything all right here?
13665,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"The Avatar is in danger, and these two knuckleheads are just standing around chit-chatting."
13666,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Aiwei,"Don't worry, Zaofu is the most secure city in the world."
13667,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I'll be the judge of that. I'm going to check every inch of this place.
13668,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Aiwei,"Lin, you do not have to work while you are here. You need to relax."
13669,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I'm fine!
13670,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Aiwei,"It doesn't take a truth seer to know that you are under a dangerous amount of stress. If you don't deal with your suppressed feelings, there will be severe consequences to your health ... and your job."
13671,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I'm not interested in talking about my feelings.
13672,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Aiwei,You won't have to say a word. I know a great acupuncturist in town who will be able to help you.
13673,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,Hmm.
13674,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,P'Li,Seems like you made quite the stir on Air Temple Island. The cops are swarming the city looking for us.
13675,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Ghazan,You still want to try to take out the president?
13676,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Zaheer,"No, he'll have to wait. We leave today."
13677,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Zaheer,There's our ticket out of here.
13678,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Driver,There's no money! I just made my last delivery!
13679,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Guo,I'll be placing several needles on each of your acu-points. There's nothing to be scared about.
13680,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,'''''I'm not afraid of needles!'''''
13681,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Guo,"Please, close your eyes and take a deep breath. This process corrects an imbalance in your chi. Please tell me if you feel any pain or pressure."
13682,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I can't feel a thing.
13683,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Guo,That's unusual. Your chi must be powerfully blocked. We're going to need more needles. Acupuncture often taps into peoples' buried memories. These memories can sometimes be difficult to process.
13684,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"Huh, buried memories. Uh-huh."
13685,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"Su, what are you doing home?"
13686,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Wow, you almost look like a real cop!"
13687,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,You're supposed to be in school.
13688,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Oh no, are you going to tell Mom? It's not like she's going to care."
13689,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,Where'd you get all that stuff?
13690,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Boy,"Oh, it fell off the back of a truck."
13691,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,What are you doing hanging out with these losers?
13692,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"They're my friends and you have no right to call them that! Come on guys, let's get out of here."
13693,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"Su, stop."
13694,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Get your hands off of me!
13695,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,You have so much potential. You're ruining your life!
13696,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,At least I have a life!
13697,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"These meteorites are perfect for beginning metalbenders. The metals have a unique property, making them easier to bend."
13698,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,That's amazing!
13699,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Here, try it!"
13700,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,Okay.
13701,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,Bolin? Is that you?
13702,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,No!
13703,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,What are you doing?
13704,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Oh, hey ladies. Just uh ... I was just looking for Pabu. Pabu!"
13705,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,He's on your shoulder.
13706,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Oh, look there you are! You know, I thought something was chewing on my ear. Probably need to get a shot. Pabu has sort of a ... a venom. Anyways, so what are you guys doing? You metalbending over here or something?"
13707,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Want to give it a shot?
13708,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Nah, it's okay. I mean, only like one earthbender in a hundred can metalbend."
13709,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Well, don't believe everything you hear. The only thing limiting you is your attitude."
13710,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Well, maybe I'll just ... I'll just stay and watch."
13711,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Try to focus on the fine pieces of earth within the metal.
13712,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,I can't believe it! I'm metalbending!
13713,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Wow, you picked that up really, really quick. Guess you're that one in a hundred."
13714,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Great job, Korra."
13715,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Radio,"Calling all units. Property reported on the corner of 5th and Harbor. Suspect's vehicle headed south on Hallow Boulevard. Units responding, identify."
13716,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,Unit three responding.
13717,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Leave them alone!
13718,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,Su?
13719,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Guo,Wait! Leaving in the middle of a session could make you sick!
13720,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I'm done here.
13721,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,Are you going to stay in your room feeling sorry for yourself all day? You owe Opal an apology for the way you treated her last night. Are you okay? You don't look good.
13722,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I'm fine!
13723,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,What did you do to me?
13724,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Guo,I tried to warn you. Come with me. Let's go finish the session. Just relax and breathe.
13725,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"So, you're robbing stores with the Terra Triad now?"
13726,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,I didn't steal anything. I just drove the car. I owed my friends a favor. It's not a big deal.
13727,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I'm not letting you get away with this.
13728,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Oh, what are you going to do, Officer? Arrest me?"
13729,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,Don't even think about taking one more step!
13730,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Officer,Good afternoon. Where are you off to today?
13731,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Driver,"I, uh, got a delivery to make at Bao Yu. I should be back later today."
13732,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Officer,You all right?
13733,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Driver,"Yeah, just a little tired. One more pick-up, then I'm clocking out."
13734,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Officer,I thought you said you had a delivery?
13735,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Driver,Did I?
13736,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Officer,I'm going to need you to step out of the vehicle and open the back of the truck.
13737,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Zaheer,Let's get out of here!
13738,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,"Hey, Bolin."
13739,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Opal! Oh, wow, you ... really know how to sneak up on someone."
13740,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,What are you doing?
13741,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Oh nothing, you know, just ... just thinking about my body and mustaches that I might have in the future."
13742,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,You're acting weird again.
13743,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Sorry. I wasn't really thinking about all my mustaches. I'm just frustrated. I've been trying to metalbend and I can't figure it out. Don't tell anyone, okay?"
13744,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,Why not?
13745,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Because it's embarrassing. This isn't the first time I've tried, and I've been wanting to metalbend ever since I heard about Toph. Your grandmother is my biggest hero!"
13746,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,My mom grew up learning from Toph. Just go train with her. Stop being so scared.
13747,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"You know what? Maybe I am scared. But what about you? I know that you want to go to the Northern Air Temple to train with Tenzin, but you haven't done it, because you're afraid too!"
13748,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,You know what? You're right. I don't want to leave my family and disappoint my mom.
13749,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"Look at us! Talking about our feelings, supporting each other."
13750,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,It's nice.
13751,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Toph,What were you thinking? And what were you thinking? You two have put me in an impossible position.
13752,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,You're mad at me? She's the one who was running around with criminals!
13753,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,This is all your fault!
13754,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I was doing my job!
13755,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Toph,"All right, enough! Here's what we're going to do. Su, you need to leave the city as soon as possible."
13756,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,What?! Where am I supposed to go?
13757,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Toph,"You'll go stay with your grandparents. Lin, give me the arrest report."
13758,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"Mom, what are you doing?! You can't cover this up! There are witnesses."
13759,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Toph,I'm the Chief of Police! I can't have a daughter in jail!
13760,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"So, once again, Suyin gets to do whatever she wants and there are no consequences."
13761,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Toph,This is our only option.
13762,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Guo,"You're going to feel a bit fragile, so it's probably best if you take it easy for a while."
13763,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,I don't need to rest. I need to do something I should've done a long time ago.
13764,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Congratulations. You're the first metalbending Avatar.
13765,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"So, umm, I've been thinking, and I'd like to try to learn metalbending. I mean, I'm sure you have a waiting list or something of a couple years so."
13766,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Let's get started.
13767,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,I think Lin is mad about something.
13768,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"Su, it's time we talk."
13769,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"After thirty years, you're finally ready to talk?"
13770,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"When we were in Mom's office that day, you could've taken responsibility for what you did. But instead, you stayed quiet and let Mom throw her whole career away."
13771,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Mom didn't throw her career away. She retired the next year. She was a hero.
13772,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,You think she ''wanted'' to retire? She was so guilt-ridden about what she did to protect you that she didn't feel worthy of her badge.
13773,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past but-"
13774,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,You made ''some'' mistakes?
13775,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Lin, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out. If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now. I've been a different person for a long time."
13776,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"You think that just because you live in a big, fancy house, and have a chef who cooks you fancy food, that you're a different person? Maybe you could fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I see right through you."
13777,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"You know what, Lin? You're the one who hasn't changed. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago."
13778,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"Okay, I guess this is how it's going to be."
13779,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,Should I stop them?
13780,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"You don't have any siblings, fighting is all part of the healing process."
13781,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Wei,Go Mom!
13782,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Huan,"My sculpture! Actually, it looks ... kinda better now."
13783,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,You've got it out of your system?
13784,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,Not quite yet!
13785,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,What are you two doing?! You're sisters! Why would you want to hurt each other?
13786,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,"Uhh, Whose going to knock?"
13787,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Bolin,"No, no, no, no, no, no! Not me! You're the Avatar, why can't you do it?"
13788,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Korra,"Uhh, I can. But I just thought that ..."
13789,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Mako,"I'll do it. Uhh, Chief, you've been sleeping for sixteen hours. We just wanted to make sure that you're okay."
13790,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,Good morning.
13791,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,What's this?
13792,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Chef,"I call it the kalenutsco. It's a mixture of kale, coconut water, and walnuts."
13793,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"Not bad! Opal, don't go. Please sit down, I want to talk to you. Look, I'm just not really comfortable talking about these kinds of things, and ... well, I wanted to say that I'm sorry about the other night."
13794,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,It's okay.
13795,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,Your mother and I have a complicated relationship and ...
13796,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,It's probably difficult for you to be here.
13797,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"You're a smart young woman, and an excellent airbender. I think it would be a wonderful opportunity to train with the other airbenders at the Northern Air Temple."
13798,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,"There's a part of me that wants to go, but ... I don't want to upset my mom."
13799,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"When I was younger, all I wanted to do was please my mother. I became a police chief because I thought it would make her happy ... but it didn't. You need to make your decisions based on what you want. Don't make the same mistakes as I did."
13800,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Opal,"Mom, Dad, can I talk to you?"
13801,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Opal has decided to go to the Northern Air Temple. I guess you had something to do with her decision.
13802,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"Well, I was just ..."
13803,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"It's okay. I'm glad she was honest with me. I want her to do what makes her happy. Mom gave us too much freedom, but I feel like I made the mistake of giving Opal too little. I think it's about time I let her choose her own way. I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time when we were younger. I can't imagine what my life would've been like if Mom hadn't sent me away, if I had stayed in the city ..."
13804,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,You'd probably be in prison.
13805,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,"You're probably right. Mako told me that you're an excellent police chief. Republic City is lucky to have you. I know Mom is proud. Can we move on? I'd love for you to be part of my life again. There's plenty of space in the house, and the kids would love having their aunt around. I do need a new co-director for my new dance performance."
13806,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Lin,"Whoa! Slow it down. How about for now, I just promise not to show up at your house and attack you again?"
13807,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Suyin,Deal!
13808,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Ghazan,She could be anywhere.
13809,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,P'Li,We'll find her. It's just a matter of time.
13810,2,Old Wounds,Change,3,93,Zaheer,She's with the Metal Clan.
13811,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Shiro Shinobi,"The Air Nation is reborn. Thanks to the energy shift from Harmonic Convergence, certain people have acquired airbending abilities including Bumi, Kai, and Opal. Although the new recruits show a lot of promise, they still have a lot to learn. While Korra remains safe in Zaofu, Tenzin brings the new airbenders to the Northern Air Temple to begin their training."
13812,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"His pupils pleaded with their master to eat something, but he refused, just like he had each day during summer. Instead he meditated and got his nourishment from the universe. So when Tang Xu completed the ninety-seventh day of his historic fast on which island?"
13813,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Otaku,Oooh! Oooh!
13814,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Anyone besides Otaku, who already studied this in his acolyte training?"
13815,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Otaku,"Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
13816,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,And is answering every question.
13817,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Otaku,Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Whaletail Island.
13818,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"That is correct. Again. Now, on day ninety-eight ..."
13819,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"Greetings, air people. I come seeking boring stories to take back to the Spirit World."
13820,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,That is incredible! When do we get to fly around on our own sky bison like that?
13821,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Only after many years of practice and intense training. Besides, we don't have enough bison here for all of you."
13822,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,What about those? It's a whole herd of bisons.
13823,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Actually, the plural of bison is bison."
13824,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Recruits,Whoa! Cool! Wow look at that!
13825,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,Can we ride those?
13826,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"No, that's a wild herd. It would take many years to tame them. Now, let's get back to our lessons."
13827,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Meelo,Dad! We brought you more airbenders!
13828,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Okay, everyone is dismissed. We'll pick this up ... tomorrow. How is everything in the city?"
13829,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Pema,"Well, we had a little scare but everything is okay. Zaheer infiltrated the air temple."
13830,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,What! Is everyone all right?
13831,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kya,"Everyone's fine. I fought with him, but he got away. And he stole some old necklace that had something to do with ... Guru ... Lak ... shmir."
13832,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Guru Laghima?
13833,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kya,"Right ... you know I can never keep all those gurus straight. There were like a million of them. Remember that long, boring story about that guy who never ate?"
13834,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Yes ... I remember.
13835,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Air Acolyte member,Avatar Korra is calling on the temple's radio.
13836,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Are you all right? Where are you?
13837,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Korra,"With Beifong's sister in Zaofu. We're totally safe, unless we get caught in another fight between Su and Lin."
13838,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Lin willingly took you to her sister?
13839,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Korra,Not exactly. We got a call about an airbender and it turned out to be Su's daughter Opal. She'll be headed your way soon.
13840,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Really? That's wonderful!
13841,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bolin,"She ''is'' wonderful, and pretty, and so smart, and she smells like flowers ... Sorry. Bolin, out."
13842,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Korra,How's the training going?
13843,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Not so well, I'm afraid. No one seems to be interested in the hard work of becoming part of the Air Nation."
13844,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Korra,"You need to give yourself a break. Let Jinora and the kids help you out, and what about Bumi? He was a naval commander, maybe he has some ideas about how you get people motivated."
13845,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Bumi?! He's my worst student.
13846,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Korra,"Yeah, but he loves to organize people. If you ask him for help, you can trick him into taking more responsibility by making him think the whole thing with his idea."
13847,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,That actually sounds like a good plan. You're turning into a pretty wise Avatar after all.
13848,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Korra,"Conflict resolution, that's what I do."
13849,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,We should go down there. I want to fly one of those bisons.
13850,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,I don't know. We might get in trouble.
13851,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,Come on? Let's have some fun. We'll be back before anyone realizes we're gone.
13852,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,I guess it would be all right.
13853,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,Look! Baby bisons. How come they're on the ground?
13854,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,"Air bison calves can't fly after a week or two after they're born. So the entire herd will stay near the ground, near the valley."
13855,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,Let's go see the babies.
13856,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Be careful. The mothers are very protective.
13857,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,"Aww, look how cute!"
13858,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,"Kai, get out of there!"
13859,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,"Wow, you really saved me down there. You know, you're an incredible airbender."
13860,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,"Well, I've been training for a long time."
13861,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,"Then, why don't you have tattoos like an airbending master?"
13862,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,My dad says I'm not a master yet.
13863,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,"You can do everything your dad can. Plus, you have all these spirit-y powers. If anyone's a master, you are."
13864,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"And so, we bring the net down on the head pirate, and he looks around real sad and says, ""I knew I should have followed my dreams and become a dentist."""
13865,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Yung,"How come you grow up to be so cool, while Tenzin became such a stick-in-the-mud?"
13866,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"Well, I guess cool is something you're born with."
13867,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Bumi, can I talk to you?"
13868,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"Let me guess, you want to criticize me for something?"
13869,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Actually, I need your help."
13870,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,Oh yeah. With what?
13871,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"I don't think I'm doing well with the new airbenders, and everyone knows you're a natural leader."
13872,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"True, I did win the Admiral Tung Natural Leadership Award, twice."
13873,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,What would you do if you were in charge? Help me be more like you.
13874,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,I'd love to. You've got to use military discipline to whip these troops into shape. The only way to deal with new recruits is to break them down so you can build them back up. Rule with an iron fist. Show them who the master is.
13875,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Thanks for the insight.
13876,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,My pleasure.
13877,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Dawn patrol! Everyone up!
13878,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,What are you doing? It's barely light out.
13879,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,I'm taking your advice. I'm going to break you down and build you back up! Now get moving recruit!
13880,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Nothing like a ten-mile hike first thing in the morning.
13881,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Yung,Don't these robes come in a warm bison fur version?
13882,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,No! Of course not.
13883,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"If it weren't so cold, I'd go right back to sleep."
13884,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Then, this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique. Airbenders are able to warm themselves only with their breathing. Everyone get into the lotus position. Ah, this is so much more refreshing than sleeping."
13885,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,You know when I said that thing about an iron fist-
13886,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Hush! Meditation time. Focus.
13887,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,Can we go back to bed now?
13888,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Now that we're refreshed and loose from our hike and meditation, it's time for a balancing exercise. The key is to maintain your heaven and earth connection. Now you try. Back up your posts! It's not hard if you concentrate. Get back up! What's the matter, you can't handle it, soldier?"
13889,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Don't you think you're a little hard on them.
13890,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Don't worry, they can take it. You'll see. Ignore the lemurs digging in your ears. Concentrate on your breathing and, you won't even know they're there! When the head is shaved, an airbender is able to feel the wind around him. It is both humbling and freeing."
13891,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,"Hey, you want to go sneak away and check on the baby bisons?"
13892,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Shhh. You should be paying attention.
13893,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"All right, who's next?"
13894,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Yung,I'm not sure I want to shave my head.
13895,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"That's fine, shaving your head is a personal choice."
13896,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Daw,"Wait, what?"
13897,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Anyone else? Fine! Then we can get to our next training exercise: obstacle course.
13898,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,You're pushing too hard. Maybe we should give them a break.
13899,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Jinora, I have this under control"
13900,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Concentrate! Remember, airbenders move like the wind."
13901,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Stay light on your feet, and you'll never feel the stinging rash cactus."
13902,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Everyone is waiting for you, Bumi. If you don't make it over the next thirty seconds, they'll ''all'' have to run through the course again!"
13903,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Airbenders,"You can do it, Bumi! Come on!"
13904,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Get back up the wall, recruit! You're letting your fellow airbenders down."
13905,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,I'm finished! I've never wanted to be an airbender and I'm too old to be back in boot camp. Count me out!
13906,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Fine, quit! We don't need your attitude in the new Air Nation."
13907,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Daw,"Master Tenzin, when do we get to go home and visit our families?"
13908,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Go home? You just got here.
13909,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Female airbender,When's dinner? I'm starving.
13910,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Yung,Can I change out of my robe now? It's itchy.
13911,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,This is just as bad as the Earth Queen's prison.
13912,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"I'm tired of all this complaining! Jinora, take over!"
13913,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,"Does this mean, I'm the master now?"
13914,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Yes, just lead them through some basic exercises."
13915,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,"Well, since I'm a master, when do you think I can get my tattoos?"
13916,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,What brought this on?
13917,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,"I was just talking to Kai, and he was asking me, so-"
13918,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Kai! What does he know about when you should get tattoos? The answer is ""no""! You're just a little girl."
13919,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,"I'm not a little girl anymore. I can airbend ''just'' as well as you. I know ''everything'' about our culture and history, and I have a stronger connection with the spirits that you ever will. Lead your own class!"
13920,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Ikki, Meelo, you're up. Just lead them through the Bagua circle."
13921,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Meelo,Look to your left! Look to your right! One of those people will not make it out of here alive.
13922,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,Sorry what I've said got you into trouble with your dad.
13923,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,It's not your fault. He just can't believe that I'm growing up now and I don't need him telling me what to do like one of his recruits.
13924,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,I know something that'll cheer you up.
13925,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Where did all the spirits go?
13926,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,Where are the babies?
13927,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Ganbat,What are these kids doing in my camp?
13928,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Ganbat,"They're the new airbenders. Must be living up in the temple. Hurry up and gather the rest of the gang and let's get out of here before someone comes looking for these kids. I'll take them to Ba Sing Se, with the rest of the fresh meat."
13929,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Tattoos. How could she think? Focus. Breathe. Bumi ruins everything. Inhale. Focus.
13930,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Pema,Taking a little break from teaching?
13931,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"I've failed. Bumi quit, the rest of the airbenders want to go home. Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?"
13932,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Pema,"You know, just because these people can airbend, it doesn't automatically make them Air Nomads."
13933,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,Tell me about it.
13934,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Pema,I remembered when I moved down my parents' house to become an Air Acolyte. That first night I was so scared and lonely and the bed was so hard.
13935,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,It's actually better for your back. Sorry.
13936,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Pema,"The point is: I really wanted to be there, but it still took time for me to adjust to feel like I was a part of it all. The people are probably feeling the same way. You have to be patient."
13937,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Now I know how Korra feels when I'm talking to her. Thank you, Pema."
13938,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Bumi, I want to apologize for losing my patience."
13939,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,I'm not talking to you.
13940,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Yung,I saw her fly off on her glider with her boyfriend.
13941,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,What? Her boyfriend? Kai!
13942,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,How can you steal these bisons? They're endangered.
13943,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Ganbat,"Well, that's why they're worth so much. The Earth Queen and her fancy friends pay big money for bison steaks and other rare meats. I even heard she ate her dad's pet bear."
13944,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,You're disgusting.
13945,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,"Hey, do that spirit beaming thing you did to find me. Go to the temple for help."
13946,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,"I can't. I'm all cramped in here and I need quiet and time to focus. But, maybe I can send a message. Spirits, I need your help. Go find Bum-Ju, tell him we're in trouble."
13947,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"No, I don't think I should apologize. Tenzin just wants to boss everybody around. I'm too old for that. Well, let's face it. I'm just not cut out to be an airbender! Well, that's your opinion. Wait, Jinora sent this spirit? Is she in trouble?"
13948,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,Jinora's in trouble. We have to go get her.
13949,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Yung,How do you know?
13950,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,Bum-Ju's friend told me.
13951,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Otaku,You're able to communicate with the spirits?
13952,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"More or less, I get the gist. Let's go."
13953,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Daw,Shouldn't Master Tenzin be dealing with this? I don't want to get into trouble
13954,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"Master Tenzin isn't here. It's up to us. Ikki and Meelo, grab some bison. Airbenders, move out!"
13955,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"Bison rustlers. They've got Kai and Jinora locked in crates. Looks like they're getting ready to leave, we'll have to move fast."
13956,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Daw,I don't know if I'm ready to get in a fight with some bison rustlers. I can tell without that telescope that they're mean-looking.
13957,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"Listen, this is what we've been training for."
13958,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Daw,We haven't been training that long.
13959,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,That's not important now. Remembered how we persevered together on that obstacle course?
13960,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Otaku,You actually quit.
13961,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"Well, I'm not quitting now. I know we've had a tough time, me more than anyone, but we're airbenders, and there aren't many of us so we've got to stick together. They've got two of our own in cages out there, and we're not leaving until we bring them home."
13962,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Meelo,Leave no airbender behind!
13963,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,In. Down. And twist.
13964,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Free the bison first.
13965,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Kai!
13966,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,What's going on down there?
13967,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Kai! Help!
13968,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,I'm coming Jinora.
13969,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Ganbat,What the ...
13970,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Ganbat,You got me. I give up.
13971,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,"You think you can kidnap Jinora, and all these baby bisons?!"
13972,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"Kai, that's enough! An airbender never attacks a defenseless opponent. But that was very good technique."
13973,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"Maybe you boys haven't heard, but there's some new airbenders on these parts. And you never mess with an airbender's bison."
13974,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Daw,"Without my shaved head, I'd never could have dodged that net. I really felt it coming at me. You guys should ''totally'' get shaved."
13975,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,"I'm proud of you. Your connection with the spirits, natural leadership, you remind me of Dad."
13976,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Bumi,"I'm sorry I've been causing you so much trouble. I guess I was just scared of not being able to measure up as an airbender. You know, even though I'm Aang's son, I never really felt that I was a part of the Air Nation before."
13977,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,You are now.
13978,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,They're so friendly now.
13979,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,The bison are the original airbenders. They recognize their own kind.
13980,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,I'm sorry for running off.
13981,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,I'm just lucky no one's hurt.
13982,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,I know.
13983,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,But I also realized that perhaps I was too harsh on you.
13984,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Does that mean I can get my airbender tattoos?
13985,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,It's hard for me to believe that my little girl is grown up enough to have her tattoos. I'll promise I'll think about it. Fair enough?
13986,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Jinora,Yeah.
13987,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Kai,"Jinora, look. They're flying!"
13988,2,Original Airbenders,Change,3,94,Tenzin,I guess everyone is growing up.
13989,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Shiro Shinobi,"Korra is now the first metalbending Avatar! After training with Su Beifong, Korra quickly picked up the new skill, and Bolin is hoping to follow in her footsteps. Meanwhile, the airbender Zaheer is closing in on Zaofu. By his side are the lavabender Ghazan, the waterbender Ming-Hua, and the combustionbender P'Li. But what do these mysterious criminals want with the Avatar?"
13990,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Wing,I can't believe I'm sparring with the Avatar!
13991,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Wei,I can't believe I'm stuck with her friend.
13992,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Hang on, I think I got it. Let me just try this. Nope, okay maybe-"
13993,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Wei,Trial by fire. It's the best way to learn metalbending. Agh!
13994,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"Whoa. Nice shot, Bolin! But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending."
13995,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Wei,"Yeah, cheater."
13996,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Mako, metalbending is extremely difficult. No one gets it right away, if they can get it at all! It's not normal!"
13997,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,Woo-hoo! Metalbending champion!
13998,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,Oh sure. She's the Avatar.
13999,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,"Guys, it's time to get cleaned up. Tonight is Opal's farewell dinner."
14000,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Oh, now I have to say bye to Opal? This is the worst day ever!"
14001,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Opal,Thanks for making my favorite meal.
14002,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Chef,"I'm really going to miss you, Opal. No one appreciates my raw veggie wraps like you do."
14003,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Every time I eat raw kale, I'm going to think of you."
14004,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Opal,You're so sweet.
14005,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"This stinks! We were just starting to get to know each other, and now you're off to the Northern Air Temple."
14006,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Opal,"We'll be together soon. You guys are coming up after finding more airbenders, right?"
14007,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Yeah, but that's ... in the future. Ugh, I hate the future!"
14008,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Opal,"Until then, we'll always have kale."
14009,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Varrick,"Kid, can I give you some relationship advice?"
14010,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Umm, no."
14011,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Varrick,"Well, your loss. Zhu Li! bring the, uh, thing. Check out my latest invention: an airbender finder."
14012,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,"Wait, that can find airbenders?"
14013,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,Uh ... I think it's broken.
14014,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Varrick,It's not broken. She needs to ''airbend'' into it! How else do you expect the thing to work?
14015,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"What's going on? I can't hear anything. I hate sitting down here! Uh, not because of you."
14016,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,I can tell you're lying.
14017,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"Everyone, if I could have your attention please? Tonight, my beautiful little girl leaves for the Northern Air Temple. Opal, none of us could be more proud of you. You're an incredible daughter, sister, friend, and soon to be airbending master. Here's to Opal. May she help lead us into the new era!"
14018,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Kuvira,Lock it down for the night.
14019,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,We'll head out first thing in the morning.
14020,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Kale, kale, kale ... Opal ..."
14021,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"What? What's going on? Pabu, sleep!"
14022,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Huh? What? Oh, Pabu. It's not play time right now. Okay, we are seriously going to have to have a talk- What the heck?! They've got Korra. They've got Korra!"
14023,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,Let her go! They've got Korra!
14024,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Ghazan,Back-up plan.
14025,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,We can't let them take her.
14026,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,I don't think they're going to get far. Look!
14027,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Kuvira,We have you surrounded. It's over. Release the Avatar!
14028,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,No way! That guy is lavabending! That's awesome ... ly not good for us.
14029,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Zaheer,I'm going to create some cover. We've got to get out of here!
14030,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,How did they get in here?
14031,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"I don't know, but we're not letting them escape!"
14032,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,There's no way to cross that moat.
14033,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,We don't need to cross it. Lin and I can drop in from the dome on cables.
14034,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,That's a great idea. Except we'll get blown up the second that third-eyed freak sees us.
14035,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"She's a combustionbender. If one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily."
14036,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,Bolin can land a shot.
14037,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,I can?
14038,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,You have to take her out right before we drop down.
14039,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,I do?
14040,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Wing,Open the hatch.
14041,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"If we get in trouble, metalbend us up."
14042,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Wing,We're in position.
14043,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,Copy that. It's Bolin time.
14044,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,All right. Bolin time. Bolin time! I can't get a clean shot!
14045,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,You have to!
14046,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Wing,Are we a go?
14047,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,No go!
14048,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Wing,"Copy that, we're a go."
14049,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"I said no! Wait! Bolin, take the shot!"
14050,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"Haha, nice job, little bro!"
14051,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Zaheer,No!
14052,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,Thanks.
14053,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Zaheer,We've failed!
14054,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,Where did they go?
14055,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"They can't be far! Guards, search the entire estate!"
14056,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,This should neutralize the shirshu toxins.
14057,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,How could you let this happen?! You assured me this was one of the most secure places in the world.
14058,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"It is. I don't know how this happened. Obviously this was a well-planned operation, so don't blame me."
14059,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Kuvira,We searched the entire estate. There's no sign of them.
14060,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,"Well, keep looking!"
14061,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,It would seem they had some inside knowledge of Zaofu. They must've been working with someone.
14062,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,The- the guards. It had to be one of them.
14063,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,I agree.
14064,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,Question them all! Whoever betrayed my city will suffer the consequences!
14065,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,What is your full name? Where were you last night? Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar?
14066,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Zhu Guan,My name is Zhu Guan.
14067,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Second guard,I was patrolling the south wall of the Beifong estates.
14068,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Third guard,I have absolutely no knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap Korra.
14069,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Varrick,"What was I doing last night? Same thing I always do. From nine to ten, I checked my body for ticks. Lyme disease is a serious killer. Then I did my nightly Varrick calisthenics, followed by thirty minutes of breath holding. I filmed the whole thing if you want to watch it."
14070,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,That won't be necessary.
14071,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,"Maybe it wasn't a guard after all. Maybe it was someone a little higher up the food chain. Aiwei, why don't you question Su?"
14072,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,"Lin, stop! Your sister was not involved!"
14073,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"No, I'll gladly be questioned. I have nothing to hide."
14074,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,What is your full name?
14075,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"Suyin Beifong. I'm the daughter of Toph and the only sister to Lin, and I had nothing to do with the attack last night."
14076,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,She is telling the truth.
14077,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,This is a waste of time! Just bring in the next guard!
14078,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,Give me your name and tell me where you are from.
14079,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Hong Li,I'm Hong Li. I was born and raised here in Zaofu.
14080,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar?
14081,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Hong Li,No.
14082,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,Did you help the attackers enter Zaofu last night?
14083,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Hong Li,"No, of course not."
14084,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,You're lying.
14085,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Hong Li,"What?! No, I'm not!"
14086,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,How did they get in and out? Where are they now?
14087,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Hong Li,"I don't know! I'm telling you, I didn't help them!"
14088,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,You're a traitor to the entire clan!
14089,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,I suggest we search his place.
14090,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,I got something!
14091,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,What?
14092,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"It looks like it's from them. ""Team assembled. Ready to rendezvous."""
14093,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,And look at this.
14094,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,These are the guards' logbooks. All their schedules and routes are in here.
14095,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,That guard knows everything. We have to get him to talk.
14096,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,Let's go confront him with this evidence right now.
14097,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,No. Let's give him a little time to sweat it out. He will talk eventually.
14098,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard ''right now''. Every minute we waste here, those guys get further away. I mean, how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals anyway?"
14099,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,What do you mean?
14100,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,That guard is only eighteen years old and has lived in Zaofu his entire life. Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than thirteen years.
14101,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,"I don't know, but we all saw the evidence. It's pretty overwhelming."
14102,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Varrick,Maybe a little ''too'' overwhelming?
14103,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Hey, Varrick. What are you doing here?"
14104,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Varrick,"Collecting pumice stones with Zhu Li. That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a nice exfoliating rock, and when you got callouses like mine, you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. Or in my case, ''feet''."
14105,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,What were you saying about the evidence?
14106,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Varrick,"I was saying that I can smell a conspiracy when I see one. Look, if I was trying to set someone up, I would tell everyone he's guilty and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof."
14107,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"Oh, you mean exactly like what you did to me?"
14108,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Varrick,"Yes, just like that! Remember how great that worked? Well, not for you."
14109,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"You're right. All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fallback."
14110,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,But for who?
14111,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city: Aiwei.
14112,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,He's not home. Or he's hiding in there. Or he's invisible. Probably just not home.
14113,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"We have to get in there and find some evidence that links Aiwei to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us."
14114,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,It's just an empty book.
14115,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"Hmm, it's like a desert on a jar."
14116,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"Bolin, put that back! We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything. You forgot where it goes, didn't you? These look like scuff marks. I think this bookshelf slides open."
14117,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,What do you think is down there?
14118,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,Could be a storage cellar.
14119,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.
14120,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,Aiwei's coming back! Quick.
14121,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,What are doing in my house? You are trespassing on the property of one of the highest-ranked officials in the city. You'd better have a good explanation.
14122,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,"We do. We do. We actually knocked on your front door and we thought we heard you say, 'Come in, I'm in the bathroom!' I don't even know why I'm saying that. You know I'm lying, and you don't even sound like that."
14123,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,"We came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers."
14124,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,"Sit. If you want to talk, let's talk over some tea. Now, what is not ''adding up'' exactly? Hong Li was clearly lying and we found evidence in his apartment."
14125,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,But don't you think it's weird how young he is? How did he ever get mixed up with this group?
14126,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,"Perhaps through a relative, or maybe he was bribed. We will find out those answers in time. But if wasn't him, who do you think it was?"
14127,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,We don't know.
14128,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,"You don't think ''I'' had something to do with this, do you?"
14129,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,We're just looking for answers.
14130,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Aiwei,"And you think you've found something, don't you? You have no idea what is coming for you, Avatar."
14131,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"Come on, he's getting away!"
14132,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,"I'm still a little new at this, so back off! Ugh!"
14133,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,He's gone.
14134,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,"Look, he must've escaped through there! Help me clear it out."
14135,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,What happened? We heard an explosion.
14136,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,Where's Aiwei?
14137,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,Your trusted adviser is the one who betrayed us. He was lying about the guard.
14138,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,What? No!
14139,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,We confronted him and he bolted through here.
14140,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,He must have collapsed the tunnel behind him.
14141,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,And he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here.
14142,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,This is where Zaheer got in and out. Aiwei was the traitor.
14143,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,I ... trusted him.
14144,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Kuvira,Is everyone okay?
14145,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,"Aiwei is a fugitive. Get all available guards to search the mountainside, and find out where this tunnel exits immediately!"
14146,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,What did you find?
14147,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Kuvira,"We located the end of the tunnel, but there's no sign of him. Just some fresh tire tracks."
14148,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,He had an escape plan all ready to go.
14149,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"I trusted him with my life. I thought we were family, but it was all a lie."
14150,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Mako,"Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought, and more dangerous."
14151,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,That's why we have to find them. We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei. Naga can track his scent.
14152,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Asami,"And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer."
14153,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,"No! We're not hunting this group. There could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now! I'm taking you back to Republic City, where I can protect you."
14154,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,"If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere. I have to stop them!"
14155,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,It's too dangerous! You are not going!
14156,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,Stop trying to protect me! I'm the Avatar. This is my job!
14157,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,Don't lecture me about jobs!
14158,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"Enough! Korra, listen to Lin."
14159,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,But ... they ...
14160,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"Please. Lin's only looking out for you. I promise you, Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice."
14161,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,"Fine, if you really think it's best."
14162,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,I do.
14163,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Lin,"Thank you, Su."
14164,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,Everyone should get some rest tonight. I'll have my people prep your airship and you can leave first thing in the morning.
14165,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,Su.
14166,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,You really think Naga could track Aiwei?
14167,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,Definitely.
14168,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,"Then, here. There's a jeep packed with supplies on the east gate. It's all gassed up and ready to go."
14169,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,What? Why?
14170,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,Because I want you to hunt down Aiwei and bring him back to me.
14171,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Bolin,But you said -
14172,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Suyin,I said what Lin wanted to hear and I bought you guys some time. Go. I'll deal with Lin in the morning.
14173,2,The Terror Within,Change,3,95,Korra,Let's get this guy! Thanks.
14174,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Shiro Shinobi,"Zaheer infiltrated Zaofu and attempted to kidnap the Avatar. After a harrowing battle, she was saved and discovered a shocking truth: Aiwei, Su's trusted adviser, has been working with Zaheer. This truth seer turned traitor managed to escape but Su tasks Team Avatar of tracking him down. Now the hunted becomes the hunter as Korra searches for answers."
14175,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"Aiwei has definitely been through here. Nice tracking, girl."
14176,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,Let's ask around. Maybe someone's seen him.
14177,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Ohh look, they have a mover poster of me. Must be big Nuktuk fans, yeah, I should go out and say hello ..."
14178,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"No. Those are wanted posters, and there's one for each of us. ""Wanted by Her Majesty, the Earth Queen, for crimes against the Kingdom."" I'm guessing this is because we took her airbenders."
14179,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"They weren't hers to keep! I swear, if I see her pinchy little queen face again, I am going to ..."
14180,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,"Uhh, guys ... We should get out of here."
14181,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Lin,Where's everyone? I've been waiting to leave for half an hour.
14182,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Suyin,"And good morning to you, Lin. Now don't get mad, Korra's fine. I'm just waiting to hear if she'd tracked down Aiwei yet."
14183,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Lin,"What! You let Korra go?! I thought we were on the same page about this, and then you go and stab me in the back?"
14184,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Suyin,"Oh, don't be so overdramatic. You can't control the Avatar's every move."
14185,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Lin,I can try.
14186,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"Naga found something. Oh ... Sorry, I forgot to bring treats but, good girl."
14187,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,This must be Aiwei's jeep. He can't be far.
14188,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Bolin and I will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis, and see if he's hold up there."
14189,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,Yes! I love it when you talk like a cop.
14190,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,I'm coming too.
14191,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"No. You and Asami wait here in case he comes back. Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves."
14192,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,All right.
14193,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Ooh, Mako, Mako, Mako! We should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover! That way, no one will recognize us. Haha, police work is so exciting!"
14194,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"All right, now we need our undercover identities! I'm an ex-United Forces operative named Ting-Ting. War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is. Tragically, she was taken from me by my archenemy Dr. Razor and -"
14195,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,Enough! Let's just find Aiwei.
14196,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,But I haven't even told your backstory.
14197,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,I'm a cop. I don't have a backstory.
14198,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,Uh! You're good at this.
14199,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Tavern owner,''Shoo''! Human customers only.
14200,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Let's see if this guy knows anything. Excuse me, sir? We're looking for a man about sixty, balding, wearing glasses in a long green robe."
14201,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,And he's got this weird piercing that goes from his nose to his ear. Freaks me out.
14202,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Tavern owner,"Yeah, sure. Sounds like a guy who came in last night. I told him I had the best drinks in the Earth Kingdom and he called me a liar."
14203,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,That's him! Any idea where he is now?
14204,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Tavern owner,"Nah, afraid not. But he was right. My drinks are terrible."
14205,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,Are you okay?
14206,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,I'm just frustrated. What does Zaheer want with me? What's his plan?
14207,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,I don't know. But I think I found a clue.
14208,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"Xai Bau's Grove, sundown. This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer!"
14209,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,"All right. Xai Bau's Grove, where are you? Go away! I'm trying to find something."
14210,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Well, aren't you a cute little spir- Ow! Hey!"
14211,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,No luck here.
14212,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,I think there might be a couple bounty hunters over there who recognize me!
14213,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,We've been made. Let's lose 'em!
14214,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Okay, I think we're clear. We should head back to Korra before someone else recognizes us."
14215,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"We could, or ... we could follow Aiwei instead. Look!"
14216,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,All right. Stay cool and follow my lead.
14217,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,Ting-Ting always finds his man.
14218,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,Keep an eye on him. I'll go get Korra.
14219,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,We found Aiwei hiding in an inn.
14220,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,That's great!
14221,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,We found something too. It looks like he's gonna meet Zaheer at sundown at a place called Xai Bau's Grove. But I can't find it anywhere on the map.
14222,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"No. Once Aiwei knows we're onto him, we lose our advantage. I say we stake out his room and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him."
14223,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer.
14224,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Good afternoon. We'd like a room on the ground floor, across from 102, please."
14225,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Innkeeper,"Forget it! Last time a bunch of teenagers came in here, they trashed the whole room."
14226,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Macao,We found you!
14227,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Innkeeper,"Hey, no bending in here! Take it outside!"
14228,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Macao,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not here to ''fight'' you. We're here to meet Nuktuk!"
14229,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Lily,We're your biggest fans. Can you make it out to Lily and Macao?
14230,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Uh, I'd be happy to. Always love meeting my fans."
14231,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Lily,I made this Nuktuk doll for you.
14232,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Uh, it's ... cute."
14233,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Innkeeper,Why didn't you tell me your friend was a mover star? I'd be happy to rent you any room in the inn.
14234,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,We'll just take the one across from 102.
14235,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Innkeeper,But that room is too small for the four of you!
14236,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Trust me, it'll be perfect."
14237,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"I'd just like to say, for the record, this room is definitely not perfect. Naga!"
14238,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,There he is.
14239,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting. This isn't. At all! Ooh, I wonder if there's any snacks in here. Hey, look! A Pai Sho board! Mako, you want to play?"
14240,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Kind of busy here, bro."
14241,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,I'll play.
14242,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Oh, well, ugh, no offense but I learned street Pai Sho from Shady Shin, and I'm pretty good. So, wouldn't really be a fair game."
14243,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,"So? I learned to play from my dad, the diabolical genius. I'll destroy you."
14244,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Well, looks we've got ourselves a Pai-Shodown. Ladies first. Uh, I don't mean to rush you, but let's speed things up a bit."
14245,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,"Why? This game is all about slow, methodical strategy."
14246,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"No, it's not. This is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, game of chance! Don't think. Just go."
14247,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,"I don't know what Shady Shin taught you, but it wasn't the real Pai Sho."
14248,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Oh really? I think Mr. Rulebook might disagree with you. The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years. It is a game of both strategy and chance. Wait, how can it be both?"
14249,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,Let me see that. There have been countless variations of Pai Sho through the centuries and each culture has its own rules and variations of the game.
14250,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"That's no help at all. Korra, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules."
14251,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"Okay, I'll put that on my to-do list, right after bringing back the Air Nation and taking down the group that tried to kidnap me."
14252,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,That's cool. Whenever you get to it.
14253,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Assuming we do find Zaheer, what then?"
14254,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,Then I make him talk.
14255,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"He was locked away for thirteen years, Korra, and never broke. I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy."
14256,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,You have a better idea?
14257,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Yeah, we spy on them. If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely. Then we'll find out who they are and what they want."
14258,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"That's just like Pai Sho! In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to ''know'' your opponent."
14259,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,Then I guess I know you pretty well. I win.
14260,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"What? Ugh. All right, you know what that was just a fluke. Best two out of three. Oh, come on! Best four out of seven. Eight out of fifteen. Seventeen out of thirty-three? Ha, ha! Looks like you're on the ropes this time."
14261,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,I can't believe it. You might actually win this one.
14262,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"No, Pabu? Why?"
14263,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,It's almost sundown. Why hasn't Aiwei left yet?
14264,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,Maybe he sneaked out when you weren't looking.
14265,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"No, I just saw him peeking out of his window fifteen minutes ago. It's in my logbook."
14266,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,I'm going over there.
14267,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Korra, wait! You're going to blow our element of surprise."
14268,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"It's over, Aiwei! Where's ...? What?"
14269,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,That's a weird way to nap.
14270,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"He's not sleeping. He's meditating. Wait! Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier. Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the physical world! It's in the Spirit World! I'm going in after him."
14271,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,We'll watch him in case he wakes up. Be careful!
14272,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"What happened back in Zaofu? You told me we wouldn't have any problems getting the Avatar? Because of you, we've all been compromised."
14273,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Aiwei,"No, any evidence was destroyed when my library burned."
14274,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,Where is your physical body now?
14275,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Aiwei,At the Misty Palms Inn. But there is no need to worry. I was not followed.
14276,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,You left a loose end.
14277,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Aiwei,"I assure you, no one knows anything about us."
14278,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"No, ''you'' are the loose end."
14279,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,Zaheer!
14280,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,It seems Aiwei was mistaken. He was followed.
14281,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"That's right. We knew he'd lead us straight to you. Now, what did you do with him?"
14282,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"He'll be spending eternity in the Fog of Lost Souls, which just leaves the two of us."
14283,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"Don't move, Zaheer. You're going to give me some answers."
14284,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"There's no need for aggression. Neither of us has our bending, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll answer whatever questions you have. You deserve that much. What would you like to know?"
14285,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"First off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?"
14286,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"We are part of a secret society, dedicated to restoring freedom to the world. We are the Red Lotus."
14287,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,''Red'' Lotus? Are you related to the White Lotus?
14288,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"We are what the White Lotus was meant to be. But after the Hundred Year War, the White Lotus lost its true purpose. Its members came out of hiding and openly served the Avatar. They became nothing but glorified bodyguards who served corrupt nations. So a great man named Xai Bau broke from the White Lotus and began his own society."
14289,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"That's a great story, but it doesn't explain why you tried to take me when I was a kid."
14290,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,That was Unalaq's idea.
14291,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,What? My uncle was part of the Red Lotus?
14292,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,Avatar Korra. Misty Palms Inn. Find her.
14293,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"I met your uncle when I was a teenager, after we had both joined the Red Lotus. We learned about Raava and Vaatu, and how Avatar Wan foolishly severed them, disrupting the balance of the world forever."
14294,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,Avatar Wan wasn't foolish! He was trying to restore balance.
14295,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"He closed the portals, severing humans from spirits. Even you realize the error in his ways."
14296,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu? That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?"
14297,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"Yes, and with members of the Red Lotus as your elemental masters, we could've taught you so much."
14298,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,It sounds like you were just trying to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted.
14299,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"No, Korra. All I wanted was to show the Avatar a better path for the world."
14300,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,"Uh, I don't know how, but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us."
14301,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,How?
14302,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,I just said I don't know how!
14303,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,"Korra, come on! Wake up!"
14304,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,What do we do?
14305,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Mako,Get Korra out of here. Bolin and I will hold them off.
14306,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when I was a kid, why wasn't he caught?"
14307,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"He wasn't with us that night, and he covered up his involvement afterwards."
14308,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"So he betrayed you, just like he betrayed me."
14309,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,Yes. He allowed me and my friends to remain in prison while he pursued his own selfish goals. Unalaq becoming a Dark Avatar was never part of our mission.
14310,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"And what is your mission, exactly?"
14311,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,I want what you want: to restore balance to this world.
14312,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,I don't think our ideas of balance are the same.
14313,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,Are you sure about that? You kept the spirit portals open. But why stop there? Bringing the spirits back should only be the beginning.
14314,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,What do you mean?
14315,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate. You've had to deal with a moronic president and a tyrannical queen. Don't you think the world would be better off if leaders like them were eliminated?
14316,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"No. I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out world leaders isn't the answer."
14317,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"It wasn't too long ago that the airbenders were nearly all wiped out, thanks to the Fire Lord's desire for world dominance. True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down."
14318,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into ''chaos''.
14319,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"Exactly. The natural order is disorder. Do you know who once said, ""New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old""?"
14320,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,No.
14321,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,The wise Guru Laghima. An airbender.
14322,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Bolin,I can't beat this guy! It's like I'm giving him ammo! Want to trade?
14323,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"You know, being locked away for so many years, I was beginning to lose hope. But when I awoke with airbending, I knew I would be the one to destroy the old world and plant seeds for a new world to flourish."
14324,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"Zaheer, please, as an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world, instead of destroying it."
14325,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,"You're a very smart young woman, Korra. But you must realize that once change begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar."
14326,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"Enough with your philosophical mumbo-jumbo! I want to know one thing. If you do capture me, what are you going to do with me?"
14327,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,You'll have that answer soon enough. The Red Lotus should have you by now. See you in the physical world.
14328,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,"Zaheer! Zaheer, you tricked me! Let me go! Asami, are you okay? Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?"
14329,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,"What's the Red Lotus? And Zaheer didn't capture us, the Earth Queen's forces did."
14330,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Korra,Where are we?
14331,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Asami,I'm not sure. Some camp by the desert. They're taking us back to Ba Sing Se.
14332,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Ghazan,The Earth Queen's army snatched up the Avatar before I could.
14333,2,The Stakeout,Change,3,96,Zaheer,Load them in the truck. We're taking a trip to Ba Sing Se.
14334,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Shiro Shinobi,"The Red Lotus is the world's newest threat. After confronting Zaheer, Korra learned that he is part of a secret society whose mission is to take out all the nations' leaders and destroy world order. But before Korra could warn anyone, she and Asami were apprehended by the Earth Queen's forces. And the Red Lotus have Mako and Bolin. Now both parties are headed toward Ba Sing Se."
14335,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,You have to let me out! The Earth Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus. I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday. He's insane!
14336,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,Screaming about terrorists in the Spirit World? You're the one who sounds insane.
14337,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,Do I have to be chained to the floor the whole way? It's going to be so uncomfortable.
14338,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,"Sorry Ma'am, I'm under orders."
14339,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"Can't you just chain me to that railing? I mean, where am I gonna go? Please?"
14340,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,"Well, as long as you're chained up, I guess it doesn't make a difference."
14341,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"Thank you, Sir."
14342,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,Can I have ... some water?
14343,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,"No water. We're also not going to bring you any rocks or fire, so don't ask. I guess there's air, but there's nothing we can do about that. We're not opening your compartment 'til we reach Ba Sing Se."
14344,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,I hoped Mako or Bolin would have shown up to save us by now. I wonder if they're okay.
14345,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,"If you think holding us hostage will give you some leverage against the Avatar, you're gonna be very disappointed."
14346,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu? You had her paralyzed. Why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?
14347,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Ghazan,"Look, all you need to know is that the world is about to change, for the better."
14348,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,"So you guys were like locked up for fifteen years, ''huh''? It must've been like crazy boring."
14349,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Ghazan,"Actually, it was only thirteen years. But it felt like thirty."
14350,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,"I mean, what did you do with all that time? Did you sing songs, work on crafts?"
14351,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Ghazan,"And I must've renamed the constellations about a thousand times. When it rained, that was a big event."
14352,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,"Ooh okay, that sounds like fun. Let me try that on you guys. ''You'' were raised by an older sister, your mustache grew in when you were ten and I'm sensing - just sensing - an unspoken attraction between you two."
14353,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Ghazan,Two out of three. Not bad.
14354,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,"Bolin, would you stop making friends with the bad guys?"
14355,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,Sorry!
14356,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"Ghazan, gag those two. We're almost there."
14357,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,We have to find a way to get out of this prison before we get to the Earth Queen.
14358,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"Don't worry, I have a plan. These airships the Cabbage Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are ''way'' cheaper than the ones Future Industries built."
14359,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"Now that's just shoddy workmanship. There's no way I can get these locks off. I need the keys. Give me five minutes, then start yelling for help."
14360,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Gun,The airship already left Fort Bosco and should be arriving in a few hours.
14361,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Gun,"Yes, Your Majesty. But first there are some ... people here who captured two of the Avatar's friends. They would like to present them to you personally."
14362,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"We don't want any bounty, Your Majesty. You can consider these two a ""thank you"" gift for simply taking the time to talk to us."
14363,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"I'd be happy to tell you, once you hand the Avatar over to me."
14364,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"How I know is not important. But if I found out, others will too. And that could put you in a difficult position."
14365,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"Your Majesty, imprisoning the Avatar will cause the other nations to turn against you and demand her freedom. Before long, we'd be in the midst of a sticky international incident. If you let me take her today, no one need ever know she was here, and you can get your airbenders back without interference. We both win."
14366,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,All I can say is: I have business with her. But she won't be bothering you again. I can assure you of that.
14367,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,Guards! Get in here! Something happened to my friend. She needs help.
14368,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,Where is she?
14369,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,Nice work. Now let's take control of the ship.
14370,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,Mayday! Mayday! The Avatar has escaped. We're going down in quadrant four of the Si Wong Desert.
14371,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"I think you might have been a little over-aggressive with the airbending. The controls are busted. Also, you broke the radio."
14372,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,"Sorry, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk."
14373,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,Hang on to something!
14374,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"Well. They say any landing you could walk away from is a good landing. But, given our location, I'm not so sure about that."
14375,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,You're the engineer. What do you think? Can we get flying again?
14376,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"It doesn't look good. Even if you metalbend the propellers back into shape, we have to dig this whole thing out of the sand."
14377,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,Is everyone all right?
14378,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,Like you care.
14379,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Kong,What the heck happened?
14380,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,"She said her friend needed help, then they knocked me out!"
14381,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,I'm sorry. But I couldn't let you take me to the Earth Queen as a captive. There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about.
14382,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Kong,More dangerous than being stranded in the desert?
14383,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,"Don't worry, Kong. I've radioed Ba Sing Se before we went down. We just need to sit tight. Somebody will be here to rescue us."
14384,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,I'm not waiting around for that. We need to get out of here ''now''.
14385,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running."
14386,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Kong,Not likely. I just tunneled out the engine room. It's like a sandbox in there.
14387,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,This ship isn't going anywhere. And neither are you. You're prisoners and it's our duty to transport you to the Earth Queen.
14388,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,"You realize that I'm the Avatar, right? You don't want to fight me."
14389,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,I'm afraid you aren't giving us much of a choice. We have our orders.
14390,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"Wait, did that sand dune just move?"
14391,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,It was probably just a mirage. The desert will play tricks on you.
14392,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,That's no mirage. Look.
14393,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Kong,"I heard that since all the spirits came back, this desert has been haunted by them."
14394,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,"Oh right, so I guess that's my fault too. Do you want to help us get this ship up and running, or do you want to wait around and meet ''that'' thing?"
14395,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Kong,"We want to fix the ship. Right, Cap?"
14396,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,Let's get to work.
14397,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,Everybody stand back.
14398,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,We have to find a way out of here before Zaheer gets his hands on Korra.
14399,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Prisoner,Take me with you. I haven't seen my wife and five kids for four years.
14400,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,Four years?
14401,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Prisoner,"The first few months were great, I-I could finally get some sleep, but ... now I really miss them."
14402,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,"Listen. Bolin, this is up to you. I know you can metalbend."
14403,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Prisoner,You can metalbend?
14404,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,No.
14405,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,Yes you can. I believe in you.
14406,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Prisoner,"I believe in you too, Bolin."
14407,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,"I appreciate that, Mako, and fellow ... prisoner man. But I've been trying and trying and trying and I've never been able to do it. Not even a little."
14408,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,You've always had the ability deep down. You just haven't had the motivation. But this is your time! Get us out of here to save Korra. You can do it! Bolin! Bolin!
14409,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Other prisoners,Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!
14410,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,"You're right. Okay, here I go. Metalbending. I can't metalbend."
14411,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Other prisoners,Aww!
14412,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Prisoner,"Hey, you guys didn't happen to bring any toilet paper, do you?"
14413,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Lin,"First, you scare the life out of me, now you want to lick me."
14414,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Lin,"Here, chew on this and leave me alone. Tonraq, you read me?"
14415,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Tonraq,"Yes, we copy."
14416,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Lin,"I've found Korra's jeep, but the kids aren't here. Meet me at the Misty Palms Oasis."
14417,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,How's it looking in there?
14418,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,I just airbent all the sand out of the engine room. I think it's clean.
14419,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Kong,Hasn't been this clean since it floated off the showroom floor.
14420,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,How's it going out here?
14421,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert. Kong, you want to see if you can get the engine started?"
14422,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Kong,Aye aye!
14423,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,All right!
14424,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,That's no spirit! I think it's gone now.
14425,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,"Kong, are you all right? What are we going to do? All of our supplies were on the ship. We've got no food, no water."
14426,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,"Easy, Arik. Another ship is on the way. We just need to hold our position for a few hours."
14427,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,We might not have a few hours.
14428,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,How far are we from the edge of the desert?
14429,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,"Too far to walk, if that's what you're thinking."
14430,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,We can't just wait around to for that thing to pick us off ''one'' by ''one''!
14431,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,"You'll do as you're told, Airman. Now get a hold of yourself!"
14432,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,Maybe we can still build something to get us all out of here.
14433,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,You want to make some wings out of scrap metal and flap real hard?
14434,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"No, but we might have enough material to construct a makeshift sand-sailer. Like the sandbenders use to get around. All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to."
14435,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,It's worth a try.
14436,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,Gather every piece of metal you can find. We'll give that sandy beast a run for his money yet.
14437,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,Looks like he's in hurry. Wait here.
14438,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Dai Li agent,"Your Majesty, we received a distress signal from the airship carrying the prisoners. We believed the ship crashed in the Si Wong desert and the Avatar may have escaped."
14439,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Dai Li agent,"It's already on its way, Your Majesty."
14440,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Ghazan,There's no way we can track her down in the desert before the queen gets to her.
14441,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,P'Li,You really think we'd be lucky enough to capture her again? She'll be long gone by the time they arrive.
14442,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,It doesn't matter. We're through chasing her. It's time to make ''her'' come to us.
14443,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"Apologies, Your Majesty. But I couldn't help overhearing that the Avatar won't be joining us today."
14444,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,That wasn't the deal.
14445,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,Maybe I forgot to mention something to you. I don't believe in queens. You think freedom is something that you can give or take on a whim ... To your people ... freedom is just as essential as ... air. And without it ... there is no life. There is only ... darkness.
14446,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Radio operator,Hey! You can't be in here!
14447,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,No need for alarm. I just need to make an announcement to the entire city. How do I do that?
14448,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Radio operator,Who do you think you are?
14449,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"Ming-Hua, please. We're here to help citizens like him, not hurt them. Now, can you help me?"
14450,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"Attention citizens of Ba Sing Se. I have an important announcement to make. Moments ago, the Earth Queen was brought down by the hands of revolutionaries, including myself. I'm not going to tell you my name, because my identity is not important. I'm not here to take over the Earth Kingdom. I think you've had enough of leaders telling you what to do. It's time for you to find your own path. No longer will you be oppressed by tyrants. From now on, you are free! I deliver Ba Sing Se be into the hands of the people!"
14451,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,"We have to get out of here, Bolin. Zaheer came here to take out the Earth Queen, and now Korra is next."
14452,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Prisoner,You know that guy? He's my hero!
14453,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,Shut up! You have to metalbend us out of here. C'mon! I know you can do it! This is your time!
14454,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,"You said before ""was my time""."
14455,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,"I know I did it, but now it's ''really'' your time. Do it!"
14456,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Bolin,"Did you see that? I did it! I mean, not for us, but I metalbent all the other cells open!"
14457,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Mako,I don't think that was you.
14458,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zaheer,"Listen to me. I'm going to set you free, but I want to talk to you first. I have a message that I need you to take to Korra."
14459,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,"She ain't pretty, but I think she'll do the job."
14460,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,No time for a test run. Let's move!
14461,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,I think he's gone. We did it!
14462,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,You want to buy a slightly used sand-sailer?
14463,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,"Thanks, Asami. You got a good head on your shoulders."
14464,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,I'm sorry for getting us stranded out there. I didn't mean for that to happen.
14465,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,"You know, whatever the conflict between you and the queen is, I'm sure it's above my pay grade. You've got a tough job. Good luck, Avatar."
14466,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Arik,"Captain, have we been in the desert for too long? Or is that really a dragon over there?"
14467,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Captain,"Ugh, let's go get a drink."
14468,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,"Dhaaah! Easy, girl. Did you think we weren't coming back to you?"
14469,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,What are you all doing here?
14470,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Tonraq,"Korra, you're safe."
14471,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,"Yeah, we made it out of the desert. Thanks to Asami."
14472,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Tonraq,Do you remember Lord Zuko?
14473,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Zuko,"I met you when you were a very young girl. It's good to see you again, Avatar Korra."
14474,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,"It's good to see you, Lord Zuko."
14475,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Lin,Thanks for ditching me back at Zaofu.
14476,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,"Yeah, sorry about that. But, how did you all find us?"
14477,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Lin,"I am a ''detective'', you know."
14478,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Asami,Did you find Mako and Bolin?
14479,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Lin,Some people at the inn saw them captured by Zaheer's crew. We don't know where they are.
14480,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Tonraq,Did you hear about the Earth Queen?
14481,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,What about her?
14482,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Radio,"Once again, the Earth Queen's reign has come to an abrupt and violent end. Ba Sing Se has descended into chaos. Rioters and looters have overrun the palace."
14483,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,The Red Lotus.
14484,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Tonraq,What's that?
14485,2,Long Live the Queen,Change,3,97,Korra,"The name of the group that's been trying to capture me and just took out the Earth Queen. I'm afraid this is only the beginning, Dad."
14486,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Shiro Shinobi,"Ba Sing Se has fallen. After Zaheer and the Red Lotus toppled the Earth Queen, the city descended into chaos. Meanwhile, Korra and Asami tried to escape their captors, but crashed in the desert. After getting to safety, they met up with Lord Zuko, Tonraq, and Beifong. Back in Ba Sing Se, Zaheer freed Mako and Bolin, giving them a vital message to deliver to Korra, but will the brothers find her in time?"
14487,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,I can't believe it! The Upper Ring is in chaos!
14488,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Royal Earthbender Guard,Stop you? I'm gonna join you. I know where the good stuff is.
14489,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,Should we do something?
14490,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,This isn't our battle. We have to deliver Zaheer's message to Korra immediately.
14491,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"Right. Okay, find Korra, deliver message. Yeah, this should be easy. We just got to get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast expansive wasteland that goes on for thousands, and thousands, of miles. This isn't gonna be easy."
14492,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,We need an airship.
14493,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"Excuse me, may I have your attention please? I'm with the Republic City Police and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar."
14494,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"What, they took everything. I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?"
14495,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,Some folks just do not have respect for other people's property. Now let's steal this airship!
14496,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,You know how to fly this thing?
14497,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"Technically speaking, no. But, c'mon, how hard could it be?"
14498,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,Up! Up!
14499,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"I don't see any up button. I see levers and switches, oh, there it is."
14500,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,The whole city is falling to pieces.
14501,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"Mako, our family's down there."
14502,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"Move over, we're getting them out."
14503,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"Oh, you think just because you dated Asami, you know how to fly this better than me?"
14504,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,Yeah.
14505,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Chow,Bolin? What are you doing here?
14506,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"I came to get you guys out. This whole block is about to go up in flames. Come on, Mako and I have an airship on the roof."
14507,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tu,We can't. Grandma won't go.
14508,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,"This place is my whole world. I will not leave! Oh, but I'm so glad my little Bolin has come back to visit. Sit down, would you like some tea?"
14509,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"Grandma, we don't have time for tea."
14510,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Chow,"Mom, please!"
14511,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,No! I can't abandon the place where I raised my family. It's my home.
14512,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"Grandma, there's one thing Mako and I've learned from all our years on the street. It doesn't matter where you go. If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home."
14513,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,I'm not going.
14514,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,Fine! You leave me no choice. We're rolling out!
14515,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,"Wait. Okay, let's go!"
14516,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tu,"Thanks for getting us out of there. I mean, I probably could have handled it myself if you guys didn't show up, but, thanks."
14517,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,May she rest in peace. This airship is nice. Is it our new home?
14518,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"No, Grandma. I'm not sure where we're gonna take you, but right now, we need to find Korra."
14519,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Chow,Did something happen to the Avatar?
14520,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"I'm afraid so. Her airship went down somewhere in the desert. She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading to Ba Sing Se. If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage."
14521,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tu,"Guys, it's the wreckage! I found it! There!"
14522,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"That's a Ba Sing Se airship, all right. But where's the rest of it?"
14523,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,I don't know. But there's some tracks.
14524,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"See, I told you. Landing is hard."
14525,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Female relative,Spirits!
14526,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"Okay, guys. We think Korra found her way back here. Now let's split off into teams and scour the town. Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu, now just give me a second while I- wait, Pabu? Pabu!"
14527,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,"Why is Bolin hugging that big rat? Eww, now he's kissing it!"
14528,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,I'm never gonna let you go again!
14529,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tu,"Guys, look out! Giant dog beast thingy!"
14530,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"Okay, all right, Naga. It's good to see you, too. Gah! Stop! You're licking my mouth."
14531,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,Asami! Korra!
14532,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,You guys are okay!
14533,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"It's really good to see you, too. Both of you."
14534,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Lin,Good. You guys aren't dead.
14535,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"Don't get all mushy on me, Chief. Tonraq. Sir."
14536,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"Oh my gosh, it's Lord Zuko! I can't believe it."
14537,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"Uhm, forgive my brother. We're just really honored to meet you, Sir."
14538,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zuko,It's a pleasure to meet you as well.
14539,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,You must be the Avatar. Mako told me so much about you. You are even more beautiful than I imagined.
14540,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"Uh, actually, that's Asami. This is Avatar Korra. Korra, this is my grandma, Yin."
14541,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,You are very muscular for a woman.
14542,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"Uhm, thanks. You too?"
14543,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,"What lovely young women. Mako, why aren't you dating any nice girls like them?"
14544,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Asami,"Uh, so what happened to you two? Where have you been?"
14545,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,We were captured by Zaheer and taken to Ba Sing Se. We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown.
14546,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,What? How did you escape?
14547,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,Zaheer let us go.
14548,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,What? Why would he do that?
14549,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,Because he wanted us to find you and deliver a message.
14550,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,Zaheer is headed to the Northern Air Temple as we speak. He said he's gonna wipe out the new Air Nation and everyone in it. Unless you turn yourself over to him.
14551,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,Zaheer's threatening innocent lives just to get to me.
14552,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tonraq,He could be bluffing.
14553,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,He's already taken out the Earth Queen. I don't think he bluffs.
14554,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,We need to radio Tenzin and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming.
14555,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,"I agree. Unfortunately, we don't have a radio on the airship."
14556,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tonraq,"There's a portable radio on the jeep, but the signal will never make it to the Northern Air Temple."
14557,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Lin,We need to get to a place that has a strong radio transmitter. The Metal Clan will have one.
14558,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,Let's go. We'll radio Su on the way. Hopefully she can get a hold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu.
14559,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,Did you have any luck getting through to Tenzin?
14560,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Suyin,No one's answering. What if Zaheer's already up there? I should never have let Opal go.
14561,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Lin,"It's going to be okay, Su."
14562,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Suyin,I hope so.
14563,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Radio operator,"We have a strong signal, but no one's answering."
14564,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,I can't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the Northern Air Temple. We have to do something.
14565,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Suyin,"I'll ready my airship. With a full force of the Metal Clan security backing us, we can take them."
14566,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,We'll never make it up there before Zaheer.
14567,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"There might be another way to stop him. It's a long shot, but Zaheer is always meditating into the Spirit World. And I know exactly where he goes: Xai Bau's Grove. If I can find him there, maybe I could somehow trap him."
14568,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Lin,We can't protect you in there. I don't like it.
14569,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,I'll be fine. I have to try.
14570,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Asami,I'll watch over her as she meditates.
14571,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"I guess, in the meantime, Mako and I will stay here and try to get through to the temple."
14572,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tonraq,We'll help Su ready the airship.
14573,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Yin,I'm going to take a nap.
14574,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,Zaheer! Come out! Face me! Leave the airbenders out of this! There you are.
14575,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Iroh,"Please don't hurt me, Korra. I'm just an old man."
14576,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,Iroh? What are you doing here?
14577,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Iroh,"I was just out searching for a new teapot to add to my collection. But instead, I found you. In the Spirit World, you always seem to find something you don't know you were looking for. You look troubled."
14578,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,I am.
14579,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Iroh,Sit. What is on your mind?
14580,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,There's a maniac on the loose and he's threatening to destroy the new Air Nation. I don't know what to do.
14581,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Iroh,"Just because you are the Avatar, doesn't mean you will have all the answers."
14582,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,I know many Avatars have needed guidance. But I'm the only one since Avatar Wan that can't get help from my past lives. I wish I could talk to Aang.
14583,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Iroh,"You know, Zuko and Aang were close friends."
14584,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"Lord Zuko, of course."
14585,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Iroh,"Yes, my nephew. Their relationship started off a little rocky, but they grew to become lifelong friends. Best friends."
14586,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"Thank you! Thank you so much. You're right about the Spirit World. I came here looking for someone else, but I'm glad I found you."
14587,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Asami,Did you find Zaheer?
14588,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"No, he wasn't there. But there's someone I need to talk to. You're leaving? Aren't you coming to the air temple with us?"
14589,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zuko,"I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm going back to the Fire Nation. If it's true that the Red Lotus is targeting the nations' leaders, I need to protect my daughter."
14590,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"I understand. You have to keep the Fire Lord safe. But before you leave, I was wondering if you could help me with something."
14591,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zuko,I was often Aang's counsel and I'd love to be yours.
14592,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,That just it. You knew Aang better than anyone. I was wondering if you knew what he might do if he were in my situation.
14593,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zuko,"Hmm. Rebuilding the Air Nation was Aang's biggest dream. He would be beside himself with joy with what you've done. And if he accomplished that goal, he might have sacrificed anything to protect it."
14594,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,So he would give himself up to save the Air Nation?
14595,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zuko,"I don't know for sure. The airbenders might have been closest to Aang's heart, but, as the Avatar, he was concerned with people of all nations. No one knew better than Aang that in times of turmoil, the world needs its Avatar the most."
14596,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,Thanks. Your uncle was right. It was helpful talking to you.
14597,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zuko,"Wait, you spoke with my uncle?"
14598,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,Yes. In the Spirit World. A couple of times actually.
14599,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Mako,Guys. We got through to the air temple.
14600,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Meelo,Who is this?
14601,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"I told you, it's Bolin!"
14602,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Meelo,Bolin's not here right now. Can I take a message?
14603,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"No! I'm not looking for Bolin, I ''am'' Bolin! Gah, look, I need you to find your dad."
14604,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Meelo,He's outside with the bison. Did you know we found a whole herd full of baby bison?
14605,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bolin,"No, a whole herd? Really?"
14606,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"Meelo, this is your commanding officer. Go get your dad, now!"
14607,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Meelo,"Yes, sir!"
14608,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"Come on, come on!"
14609,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,Hello? This is Tenzin.
14610,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,Tenzin! Listen to me carefully. Zaheer is on his way to the temple. He's coming for the airbenders. You have to get everyone out of there immediately. Drop everything. Leave! Now!
14611,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,Oh no.
14612,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Korra,"What? What is it? Tenzin! Tenzin, what's happening?!"
14613,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,It's too late. He's here.
14614,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Meelo,"What is it, Daddy?"
14615,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,We need to get everyone out of here. Stay close to me.
14616,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bumi,"What's going on, Tenzin?"
14617,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,It's Zaheer. Round everyone up! We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately!
14618,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Kai,"Guys, we got an emergency. We're evacuating the temple. Come on."
14619,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Kai,Look out!
14620,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bumi,It's Zaheer! We have to leave.
14621,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Ming Hua,"No one's going anywhere, or she gets it."
14622,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zaheer,Good. The entire family is here.
14623,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zaheer,It's a pleasure to finally meet a true airbending master.
14624,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,What is it you want from us?
14625,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zaheer,"Nothing at all. In fact, if everyone cooperates, you will all walk out of this situation unharmed."
14626,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,Then what are you doing here?
14627,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zaheer,"I want Korra, and I'm tired of chasing her."
14628,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,You're using us as leverage.
14629,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zaheer,Yes.
14630,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,I will never let you get to Korra.
14631,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zaheer,"Unfortunately, you don't have a choice."
14632,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,"Yes, I do."
14633,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,"Jinora! Get everyone out of here. Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off! And stay out of her line of sight! Go, ''go''!"
14634,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Pema,It's too dangerous. We'll never make it to the stables with her up there.
14635,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Kya,No.
14636,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bumi,I see you're having as much fun as I am.
14637,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Kai,I can't wait any longer.
14638,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Jinora,"Wait, what are you doing?"
14639,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Kai,Whatever I can. Get to the bison! Get out of here!
14640,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Jinora,Kai! No.
14641,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bumi,I got you.
14642,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Kya,"Bumi, let go!"
14643,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Bumi,But we could die!
14644,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Kya,We're gonna die if we hang on!
14645,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Zaheer,Give up. It's over.
14646,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Tenzin,"As long as I'm breathing, it's not over."
14647,2,The Ultimatum,Change,3,98,Kai,"Woah! Thanks, buddy. Yip, yip!"
14648,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Shiro Shinobi,"The new Air Nation is in jeopardy. In an effort to force Korra to surrender herself, Zaheer ambushed the Northern Air Temple. Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya attempted to hold off the Red Lotus, but were injured in battle. The airbenders were unable to escape and everyone was taken captive except Kai. Now Korra and Team Avatar race to the temple hoping to mount a rescue."
14649,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,"I say we make our approach from the west, drop down from the airship on cables, ambush these Red Lotus low-lives before they know what hit them."
14650,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,It will never work. That Combustion Lady will pick us off one by one.
14651,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,You have a better idea on how to save the airbenders?
14652,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,"Yeah. We come up from the valley, scale the side of the mountain and take them off guard."
14653,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,That could work.
14654,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,"And give them the high ground? No, if their lavabender spots us, he'll melt the mountainside and us with it."
14655,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,"Wait, I've got it. I'll disguise myself as a lost hiker, and once I'm in the temple, I'll distract the Red Lotus with my bird calls. That's when you all strike."
14656,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,"Bird calls, really?"
14657,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,Well I haven't noticed you offering any suggestions.
14658,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"It doesn't matter. None of these ideas will work. The second Zaheer realizes we're up to something, he'll wipe out the airbenders."
14659,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,"And Opal is one of those airbenders. Believe me, I understand what's at stake."
14660,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,Then I'll think you agree that the only plan that will work is for me to give myself up.
14661,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,What?
14662,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,"Korra, no."
14663,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,We'll figure out another way.
14664,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"I talked it over with Lord Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought. I have to do this."
14665,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Asami,You can't expect us to sit by and let Zaheer take you.
14666,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"The world has been out of balance for far too long: it needs the Air Nation back again. I can't let Zaheer destroy it and everyone we love. Help me save the airbenders, then you can worry about saving me."
14667,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,"We're with you, Korra."
14668,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,"Yes, whatever you need, they're here."
14669,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,I'll go radio Zaheer.
14670,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"Zaheer, are you there? It's me."
14671,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,"I've been waiting for your call. So, do we have a deal?"
14672,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"Yes. You release the airbenders, and then I'll turn myself over."
14673,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,"And take away the only leverage I have? No. I can't do that. Listen carefully, here's what I need you to do."
14674,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,Will you sit down? I'm already tense enough as it is.
14675,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,"I'm just worried about Opal, and Pabu's not here to comfort me. I hope he and Naga are doing okay back in Zaofu."
14676,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Yin,"No, not Mako's scarf! Bad dog and rat thingy! I'm very disappointed in you two."
14677,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,Did you speak to Zaheer?
14678,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"Yes. He told me to come to the top of Laghima's Peak at noon, alone. Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple."
14679,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,I think I figured a way to play this so that the airbenders and Korra all come out in one piece.
14680,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,How?
14681,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,"Zaheer doesn't know how many of us there are, so we have the numbers advantage. I say we split into two teams: Mako, Bolin and Asami will take the airship up to the temple. Meanwhile, my metalbenders, Tonraq, Lin, and I will get in position below Laghima's Peak."
14682,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind. Empty and become wind.
14683,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,P'Li,The airbenders are secured.
14684,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,"Thank you, P'Li. For everything."
14685,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,P'Li,Of course.
14686,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,I want you to know: not one day went by in that prison when I didn't think of you.
14687,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,P'Li,The years apart only made my love for you stronger. And deep down I knew you would find a way to get me out. Just like you saved me from becoming that warlord's killing machine when I was a girl. You've shown me what true freedom means.
14688,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,"And after today, we'll show the entire world what it means. No more prisons, no more running."
14689,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,P'Li,"I love you, Zaheer."
14690,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,I love you too.
14691,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,Radio the second you see those airbenders.
14692,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,"I will, Chief. Good luck."
14693,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Asami,"Be careful, Korra."
14694,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,You too.
14695,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,Korra.
14696,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"Don't worry, Dad. I'll be all right."
14697,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,I just want you to know how proud I am of you. The risk you're taking to save the Air Nation will be remembered for generations.
14698,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"I love you, Dad."
14699,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,"I love you too, sweetheart."
14700,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"And Dad, watch out for Zaheer. He's not very fond of world leaders."
14701,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,I can handle him. Just stay focused on your mission.
14702,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,"Oh, man."
14703,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,Must have been some fight.
14704,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"Mako, did you see the airbenders?"
14705,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,Not yet. We're just arriving. Don't turn yourself over until I get a visual on them.
14706,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Ghazan,"This way. You want the airbenders, or not?"
14707,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,Drop your staff and surrender yourself. Don't make me come get you.
14708,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,"Mako, what's going on?"
14709,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,They're here. And so is the lavabender.
14710,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,Tell Ghazan to let the airbenders go.
14711,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,Not 'til you turn yourself over. This isn't a negotiation. Wipe them out!
14712,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,No! Wait. I'm coming.
14713,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,Stand down.
14714,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,P'Li,Don't bother trying to metalbend out of these: they're platinum.
14715,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,We have her.
14716,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Asami,"It's okay, Tenzin. We're about to get you out of here."
14717,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,"Korra, it was a trick! They're not here. Don't turn yourself over!"
14718,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,We had a deal!
14719,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,"Chief, get Korra out of there. Now!"
14720,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,Go! Go!
14721,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,P'Li,Get the Avatar on the airship. I'll deal with them.
14722,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,"Nowhere to go, Zaheer!"
14723,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Asami,Where're the airbenders?
14724,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,I don't know. Zaheer moved them out of the temple.
14725,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Asami,Come on. We have to get to the airship.
14726,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,Not gonna happen. The exit's blocked.
14727,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Asami,Where's Oogi?
14728,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,"Gone. All the bison got scared off during the attack. But, I think I know another way out. Bolin, can you get us to that wall?"
14729,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,On it!
14730,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,Through there.
14731,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,"Is it just me, or is it uh, getting really warm in here? Oh, this is not good. Let's move it, people!"
14732,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,Say hello to the Earth Queen for me.
14733,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,Dad!
14734,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,We're pinned down.
14735,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,I'm gonna draw her fire. You take her out.
14736,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,Lin. No.
14737,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,"I love you. Come and get me, you Third-Eyed Freak!"
14738,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,P'Li!
14739,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,"It's over, Zaheer."
14740,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,Let go your earthly tether.
14741,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,Release the Avatar.
14742,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,Enter the void.
14743,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,This is your last warning!
14744,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,"Empty, and become wind."
14745,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,No! Stop!
14746,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,"Did he just, fly?"
14747,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Ghazan,Guess he doesn't need a ride.
14748,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,Korra.
14749,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,We can't outrun it! This way.
14750,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,Now what?
14751,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,Bolin!
14752,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,Incredible.
14753,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,You're a lavabender.
14754,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,I know. I just found out.
14755,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,"Hey, you guys need a lift?"
14756,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,Kai. You're all right.
14757,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,More or less. Everyone hop on.
14758,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,"I owe you my life. Thank you, Captain."
14759,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kuvira,You can call me Kuvira.
14760,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,"Hey everybody, there's something I got to tell you."
14761,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,How did you guys make it out of the temple alive?
14762,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,"It was all Bolin. I thought we were done for, then out of nowhere, he ''lavabends''."
14763,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,I knew you had the potential for something big. You just had to believe in yourself.
14764,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,"You're right. Being moments from death was a pretty good motivator too. Of course, we would have never made it back with Kai."
14765,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,Glad I could help. So anyway-
14766,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,Did Zaheer get away with Korra?
14767,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,I'm afraid so.
14768,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,"Apparently, he can fly now."
14769,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,What?
14770,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Asami,How?
14771,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Bolin,Are you sure?
14772,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,I wouldn't believe it either if I hadn't seen it for myself.
14773,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,I've heard the legends about Guru Laghima's ability to fly. I'd never imagine they were true.
14774,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tonraq,So what's our next move?
14775,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,I have an idea.
14776,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,"Not right now, kid! We need to figure out where Zaheer took Korra."
14777,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,And find the airbenders.
14778,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,"That's what I've been trying to tell you. I know where the airbenders are, and I bet it's where Korra is too."
14779,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,"Well, why didn't you say something?"
14780,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,Where are they? How did you find them?
14781,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,"After I got blasted out the sky, I woke up on the side of the mountain, where this little fellow found me. I tried to sneak back into the temple, to see if I could rescue anyone, and that's when I saw the airship leaving. I followed it into some caves a few miles from here. The giant lady and some people put the airbenders into the caves."
14782,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,Was it Ghazan and Ming-Hua?
14783,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,"No, there were four more of them. They didn't look familiar."
14784,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,Must be more Red Lotus members than we thought.
14785,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,"I couldn't fight them on my own, so I came back here, hoping you guys would show up."
14786,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Lin,We need to get to those caves.
14787,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,How? I don't think we can all fit on my bison.
14788,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Tenzin,"Oogi! I'm glad to see you too, old friend."
14789,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kuvira,I want to come with you.
14790,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Suyin,"No, Kuvira. Stay with the injured. We'll be back for you once we have the Avatar."
14791,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,"Hey. Um, I appreciate you coming back for us. Sorry for ever giving you a hard time."
14792,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Kai,That's okay. I probably deserved it.
14793,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Mako,"Yeah, you kind of did."
14794,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,I wasn't sure I could. Only one other airbender in history had the ability.
14795,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Ghazan,How did you figure out how to do it?
14796,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,I found true freedom. I am no longer bound to this earth by worldly desires. I have entered the void.
14797,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,She sacrificed her life for our cause. Now let's make sure it wasn't in vain.
14798,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Korra,You. You killed my father!
14799,2,Enter the Void,Change,3,99,Zaheer,I understand your grief. I also lost someone I loved today. But your pain will soon be over. Bring the poison.
14800,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Shiro Shinobi,"The Red Lotus has captured the Avatar. Korra gave herself up in exchange for the airbenders, but Zaheer double crossed her, while Ghazan trapped Team Avatar at the temple. All seems lost until Bolin saved their lives by lavabending. But he's not the only one with new skills. Zaheer unlocked the ancient airbending ability of flight. Will Team Avatar save the Air Nation and Korra before it's too late?"
14801,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,"You won't get out, unless the Metal Clan has taught you a way to bend platinum. Once we administer this poison, your body will naturally react, forcing you into the Avatar State in an effort to keep you alive. Sadly for you, you'll be entering it for the last time."
14802,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Korra,No! The Avatar Cycle.
14803,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,"Yes. When we dispatch you in the Avatar State, the cycle will end. So we lucky few, this band of brothers and sisters in anarchy, are witnessing the beginning of an era of true freedom. Together, we will forge a world without kings and queens, without borders or nations, where Man's only allegiance is to himself and those he loves. We will return to the true balance of natural order. And though you will never again be reborn, your name will echo throughout history: Korra, the last Avatar."
14804,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Opal,Did you find any way to escape?
14805,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Jinora,"No. Not yet. But don't worry, we'll find a way out soon."
14806,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Daw,They might not make it that long.
14807,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ikki,"Korra will come and save us, right?"
14808,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Jinora,I think we're gonna have to do this on our own.
14809,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,Administer the poison.
14810,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,"Get ready. As soon as she's in the Avatar State, take her out."
14811,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ghazan,Wait. Why isn't she staying in the Avatar State?
14812,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,Give it time. She can't resist for long.
14813,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Kai,The place where I saw them taking the airbenders is around here.
14814,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Mako,That's got to be where they took Korra.
14815,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Kai,"That's it. Down there, Lefty."
14816,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tenzin,"Find the airbenders, and my family."
14817,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Suyin,Don't worry. I'm not coming out without our children and the rest of your people.
14818,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,It's working.
14819,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Amon,"I told you, Korra. The world doesn't need you anymore."
14820,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Unalaq,"The time of the Avatar is over, Korra. Give up."
14821,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Vaatu,"You're too weak to resist, and I'm stronger than ever. There's no use fighting. Let go."
14822,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ikki,I'm thirsty!
14823,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Meelo,I gotta go pee.
14824,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Daw,Me too.
14825,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Pema,"Sir, please. We just ask some water. There are children, and a baby here."
14826,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Opal,Mom!
14827,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Suyin,"Oh, honey, I'm so glad you're safe."
14828,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bolin,Me too.
14829,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Jinora,You're alive! I can't believe it.
14830,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Kai,"Why? Just because I was blown out of the sky, and fell hundreds of feet down a cliff? Don't you know it takes more than that to get rid of me?"
14831,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Lin,We have to get these two out of here now. They don't look so good.
14832,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bumi,What are you talking about? I feel great!
14833,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tonraq,You guys get everyone out of here. I'll search for Korra.
14834,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Mako,We're going with you.
14835,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Jinora,You don't have to search for her. I know exactly where she's being held.
14836,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,Now! Destroy the Avatar!
14837,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tonraq,Korra!
14838,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tonraq,We have to help her.
14839,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bolin,Look out!
14840,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Mako,"You help Korra, we got this."
14841,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ikki,Daddy!
14842,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tenzin,"Oh, thank goodness you're all right."
14843,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Pema,"Honey, are you okay?"
14844,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tenzin,I'll be fine.
14845,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tonraq,We have to help Korra.
14846,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bolin,What are you smiling about?
14847,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ghazan,I was just remembering the last time we fought.
14848,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bolin,"Well, a lot has changed since then."
14849,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ghazan,So that's how you got out of the temple. Not bad. Let's see what you got!
14850,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,You can't fight me and the poison.
14851,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Kai,I can fly up on my bison to help her.
14852,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Lin,You'd never be able to keep up with Zaheer. He's too powerful.
14853,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Kai,We have to do something!
14854,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bumi,How can he fly like that?
14855,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tenzin,He's unlocked powers of airbending that haven't existed for thousands of years.
14856,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Jinora,"There haven't been ''this'' many airbenders in one place for a long time either. We have power together. Hurry, everyone form a circle! Follow me."
14857,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Mako,You have no water. It's over.
14858,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bolin,"Give up, Ghazan! You can't win."
14859,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ghazan,"I'm never going back to prison. If I'm going down today, you're coming with me!"
14860,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bolin,"Mako, hang on!"
14861,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,The poison has done its work. The Avatar Cycle will be over momentarily.
14862,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tonraq,"Korra. Sweetheart. It's me, Dad. Please hang on."
14863,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Lin,What are you laughing about?
14864,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,You're too late! The poison has been in her system too long. The Red Lotus has won!
14865,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Jinora,You can save her! The poison is metallic!
14866,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Korra,Dad. You're alive.
14867,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tonraq,I'm here for you. I'm never gonna let you go.
14868,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zaheer,No! No! You don't understand! The revolution has already begun. Chaos is the natural order of-
14869,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bolin,"See what I did there? I put a sock in him, literally."
14870,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Opal,Classic Bolin.
14871,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Bolin,I do what I do.
14872,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Asami,There you go. All fixed up for a formal Avatar appearance. Take a look.
14873,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Korra,It's great. Thanks.
14874,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Korra,"You're right. Okay, let's go."
14875,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tonraq,"You look beautiful, sweetie."
14876,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tenzin,"You're looking stronger everyday, Korra."
14877,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Raiko,"I'd like to officially welcome you back to Republic City. I know that the last time we saw each other, it didn't end on the best terms. But I want to thank you for taking down those Red Lotus terrorists."
14878,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Asami,We should go inside.
14879,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ikki,I-I can help.
14880,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Meelo,I want to ride with Korra. Jinora's already inside. Smells like shoe trees.
14881,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Ikki,"Sandalwood, Meelo."
14882,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Raiko,She's not looking good.
14883,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tonraq,Neither would you if you'd gone through what she had.
14884,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tenzin,She'll be fine. She just needs time to heal. The poison took a great toll.
14885,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Raiko,"Of course. I'm just saying, with the Earth Kingdom in complete disarray since the loss of the Queen ..."
14886,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Zuko,"And even with Zaheer locked up again, we still don't know how many Red Lotus members might be out there, hiding."
14887,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Raiko,"Exactly. With the world getting more and more dangerous, we need the Avatar now more than ever. Who will protect us while she's in a wheelchair?"
14888,2,Venom of the Red Lotus,Change,3,100,Tenzin,"Jinora, come forward. Today, we welcome the first airbending master in a generation. And I couldn't be more proud of my daughter. When the existence of our people was threatened, when the Avatar's life hung in the balance, Jinora never gave up hope. Thanks to her leadership, I see a very bright future for the Air Nation. Of course, there would be no Air Nation without Avatar Korra: she opened the portals and somehow the world began anew for us. And she was even willing to lay down her own life in order to protect ours. There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done. But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice. So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the earth. But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord to restore balance and peace. Avatar Korra, I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the world. Now, let us anoint the master who will help lead us in our new path."
14889,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Shiro Shinobi,"Welcome to Republic City, the place of hopes, dreams and Spirit Wilds! This metropolis truly has something for everyone. Visit Air Temple Island, the hub for all airbenders as they travel the world, helping others. Or take a stroll through beautiful Avatar Korra Park, named in honor of ""You-Know-Who""! We've missed her these past three years and we can't wait to welcome her home. Get well soon, Korra! And of course, you'll want to see our most unique attractions: the Spirit Wilds. Here, spirits and people live harmoniously together. Like this old codger, and his new pals. Yes siree, this town is truly on the up and up! Come be a part of the action in Republic City!"
14890,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Raiko,"And of course, my biggest thanks goes to Asami Sato and Future Industries. She brought our old central terminal into the modern era. Ladies and gentlemen, the world is entering a new age of peace and prosperity. Soon, Prince Wu will take his rightful place on the Earth Kingdom throne. And thanks to our updated rail system, Republic City and the Earth Kingdom will be united like never before!"
14891,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"Hey there! Asami, right? Great train house. Maybe you can give me a personal tour sometime, what do you say?"
14892,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Asami,"I do like the idea of putting you on a train and sending you far, ''far'' away."
14893,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"That's ... that's funny. I like funny dames. Maybe I should introduce myself. I'm Prince Wu, future king."
14894,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Asami,Yeah ... I'm aware of who you are.
14895,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"Don't let my reputation intimidate you. I'm still human just like everyone else. Only more human, like, extra human, or, hmm, ''superhuman''."
14896,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Asami,Superhuman?
14897,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"So, what do you say? Can I show you a low-key night out with a superhuman soon-to-be king?"
14898,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,Prince Wu! President Raiko has some really important ... king stuff to talk to you about.
14899,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,Now? Fine. Think over the offer. I'll be back.
14900,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,"He's a ''real'' charmer, huh?"
14901,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Asami,He's ... something. How can you stand being his bodyguard?
14902,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,"Well, I just remind myself that once he's on the throne, I go back to being a detective."
14903,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Asami,And that works?
14904,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,"I also go home, and smash my head into the wall for an hour, you know, just to get the stress out."
14905,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Asami,"It's good to see you, Mako. It's been too long. You hear from Bolin lately?"
14906,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,"I haven't talked to him for a while, but he's coming in a few days for the coronation. And Beifong told me that Korra is getting in tonight."
14907,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Asami,"I can't wait to see her. It's going to be weird, having the old Team Avatar back in the city after all these years."
14908,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Tenzin,"After your coronation, the United Forces will escort you to Ba Sing Se."
14909,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,Right. About that. Are we all positive that the Earth Kingdom is safe enough for me to return? I don't have to remind everyone what happened to my great-aunt three years ago?! May she rest in peace.
14910,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Raiko,"Prince Wu, I assure you, Kuvira has the Earth Kingdom pretty much stabilized at this point."
14911,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"Uh ... define ""pretty much""."
14912,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Tenzin,"Well, the roving bandits have ''mostly'' been dispersed."
14913,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,Mostly?
14914,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Lin,Don't worry kid. The chances of you being assassinated are almost zero.
14915,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,''Almost''?
14916,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Shopkeeper,Get out of here! We don't have anything left.
14917,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,"It's safe to come out, everyone! The airbenders are here."
14918,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,You finally made it! So where are the rest of you?
14919,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,"Actually, it's just the two of us, but we're going to do everything we can to help. I'm Opal, and this is Kai."
14920,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,It's nice to meet you.
14921,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,"What? I called Master Tenzin because my state has been under siege by bandits for months. They blocked all the roads, cut off our supply lines, and all he sent is you two kids?"
14922,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,"Hey, us two kids just took care of those three guys for you."
14923,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,There are hundreds more where they came from. My citizens are going hungry. Our entire state is on the brink of collapse.
14924,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,"Unfortunately, the Air Nation is spread thin right now. We're all you have."
14925,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Bolin,We just got some good news. Two more Earth Kingdom states have agreed to join us.
14926,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Varrick,"That's great! Zhu Li, dish out some of that special celebration tea!"
14927,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,None for me. I won't celebrate until the Earth Kingdom is one hundred percent reunited.
14928,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,Why have we stopped?
14929,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Driver,Apologies. There are rocks on the tracks. It's most likely bandits. We're sending troops to handle the situation.
14930,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,Call them off. I will take care of the bandits ''myself''.
14931,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"And you're the bandits who have been causing chaos where I'm trying to establish order, aren't you?"
14932,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,Don't talk over me!
14933,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"Stop groveling as if this is the worst day of your life. This ... is a good day. I'm going to give you all the opportunity to rehabilitate yourselves, and become productive members of your nation. Right now, you're lost, but pledge your loyalty to me, and I'll give you a new purpose in your lives. Of course, if you don't want to join, you could always stay right here. Hopefully, someone saves you before the next train speeds through, but I wouldn't count on it."
14934,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,I don't know why we're leaving so early if you're just getting a haircut. The dinner at Air Temple Island isn't until later tonight.
14935,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"Because I'm not just getting a haircut, it's a spa day! We're talking minimum four hours."
14936,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,Are you kidding me? What are you having done that takes four hours?
14937,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"A rejuvenating tea-leaf skin wrap. Have you ever gotten one of those, Mako?"
14938,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,"Yeah, I'm ... not interested."
14939,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"You will be. So while your hands soak in a bubbling milk-bath, your feet are in a tub full of these little sucker-fish that literally eat your calluses away. Gobble them right up! Crazy, huh?"
14940,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,That's ''disgusting''!
14941,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"Then, they scrape your skin with blocks of sea-salt and lube you up with seaweed-infused aloe, wrap you in tea leaves, put you in a hot box for four hours, and ''bam''! You're done! Mako, look at all my fans! They must be in town for my coronation."
14942,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,I don't know if all those people are your fans.
14943,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,"Wu, we have to get you out of here! Go! Go!"
14944,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,What just happened out there?
14945,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,I think those were Kuvira's supporters in the crowd.
14946,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"Oh no! Mako, I've been hit! It's a ''gusher''!"
14947,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,That's not blood. It's strawberry pie.
14948,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,"Oh. Yeah, you're right. But that was close. I don't know what would have happened if you weren't there."
14949,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,You would have been hit by a pie. It's really not that big of a deal.
14950,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,Or I could have been killed! I don't know what I'd ever do without you! Wait a second. Did you say ''strawberry'' pie? I'm allergic to strawberries! I don't think I can breathe! Get me to the hospital! Wu down!
14951,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,You're allergic to bee stings!
14952,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,Look! A train made it through!
14953,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,Maybe they brought food and supplies!
14954,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,"Hey, what's your boyfriend doing here?"
14955,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,"If he's here, he must be with Kuvira and my brother. This isn't going to be good."
14956,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,Bolin!
14957,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Bolin,"Kai! ''Wow'', you are a lot heavier than you used to be. You're really growing up."
14958,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,What's up with your new hair? You look like a stiff.
14959,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Bolin,"Hey, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent and professional."
14960,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,Don't believe everything she says.
14961,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Bolin,"Opal, I can't believe you're here too! I missed you so much."
14962,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,I missed you too.
14963,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,What a wonderful surprise. A happy reunion for my favorite couple.
14964,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,Like you care. She still hasn't forgiven you.
14965,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,I guess when her son ''betrays'' her ...
14966,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"Please, Opal, we're not here to bicker with you about something that happened three years ago. We're here to help this town, just like you."
14967,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,I've heard how you help towns. By conquering them.
14968,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"I know the rumors about me can be pretty nasty, but I am giving everyone in this nation a better future. And with Bolin's help, and my fiancé's ideas, we're laying the ground work for the people to achieve their own greatness."
14969,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,Your fiancé?
14970,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,You haven't heard? Your brother and I are getting married.
14971,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Bolin,"Isn't that great, sweetie?"
14972,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"I know things got heated with your family when Baatar and I left Zaofu, but don't you think it's time to forgive and forget?"
14973,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"Hello, governor. I was wondering if you and I could talk privately."
14974,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"So, have you had time to rethink my ''generous'' offer?"
14975,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,''Generous''? You want to take everything. How is that generous?
14976,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,"I know how you manipulate states, and force them to join up under you. I know the only reason you want this region is because it is rich in ore. They might call you ""The Great Uniter"", but you're destroying everything! I'll ''never'' turn the great state of Yi over to you!"
14977,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"You have a lot of pride, but it cannot protect your people. Your ''pride'' will not stop the hordes as your city crumbles to the ground. And your ''pride'' will certainly not feed your hungry when all that is left is rubble!"
14978,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,''Leave!'' Get out of my state!
14979,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"You ''will'' perish, unless you take my generous offer."
14980,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,It's time to go. We're not wanted here.
14981,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Bolin,What happened?
14982,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,It appears we can't make a deal right now.
14983,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,Wait! Aren't you guys going to stick around and help?
14984,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"Here's the contract. We'll wait at the border for one day. You get the governor to sign it, and you'll have all the help you need."
14985,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Bolin,I guess ... I got to go.
14986,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,"Don't! Please, you can't turn your back on these people!"
14987,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Bolin,"I'm not! I wanna help, but if the Governor wants us gone, there's ... there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. Hey ... Opal, please."
14988,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,"Leave, if that's what you're going to do."
14989,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,"You know, we might not need their help after all. The roads may be impassable, but not the skies. We can use Lefty to fly to all the nearby villages, pick up supplies, and fly back."
14990,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,You're right. We can save this town ourselves.
14991,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Farmer,Sorry we couldn't give you more. That's all we could spare.
14992,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,"Every little bit helps. Because of you and the other farmers around here, we have more than enough food to feed the town until we can get some reinforcements."
14993,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,Thanks!
14994,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,So ... you and Bolin doing okay?
14995,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,I don't know. It's really tough having a long distance relationship. And I can't stand that he's working with Kuvira.
14996,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,"I can tell. But it does seem like he found his calling, doesn't it? He loves helping people."
14997,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,Maybe. It's just ... he's changed a lot since he's been around her.
14998,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,He's growing up.
14999,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,"Actually, we're doing fine. You hear that?"
15000,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,It's more bandits!
15001,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,We're hooked!
15002,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,No!
15003,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,What happened? Where's all the food?
15004,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Opal,We were attacked in mid-air. We lost everything.
15005,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,It might be time to make a tough call.
15006,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,Here. Tell Kuvira to save my people.
15007,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kai,"For what it's worth, I think you made the right decision."
15008,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,Did I ever really have a choice?
15009,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Meelo,"When Korra gets here, I bet she's not even going to know who I am."
15010,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Ikki,Why is that?
15011,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Meelo,Because Meelo the ''boy'' has turned into Meelo the ''man''!
15012,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Ikki,Right. You're completely unrecognizable.
15013,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Wu,You've never had the tea leaf wrap? You have no idea what you're missing. The face massage ''alone'' is to die for.
15014,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,Ugh. This coronation cannot come soon enough. I can't wait to go back to being a detective.
15015,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Lin,"Right ... umm ... yeah, about that ..."
15016,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,What?
15017,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Lin,I don't know how to tell you this ... you're going to Ba Sing Se ... with the prince.
15018,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,No!
15019,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Lin,"I tried to get you out of it, but it's over my head. Wu personally asked Raiko. He says he doesn't know what he'd do without you."
15020,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Lin,"Not anymore. You're just a pawn in Raiko's diplomatic game. You can try talking to him, but I don't think he's going to let you quit."
15021,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Mako,
15022,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Acolyte,There's a Southern Water Tribe ship pulling up to the dock!
15023,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Children,Korra!
15024,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Kuvira,"The State of Yi is now under the full protection of my army. Proclaim your loyalty, ''if'' you wish to keep your post."
15025,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Governor,"I pledge my loyalty to you, ''oh Great Uniter''."
15026,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Tonraq,What do you mean? Isn't Korra already here?
15027,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Tenzin,"No, we thought she was coming with you."
15028,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Tonraq,Korra left the South Pole six months ago. She's written me letters. She said she was here in Republic City.
15029,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Tenzin,"I assure you, your daughter is not here."
15030,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Tonraq,Then where is she?
15031,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Korra,Is that all you got?
15032,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Announcer,We have a winner!
15033,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Announcer,Here. For your lackluster participation.
15034,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Korra,Thanks.
15035,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Announcer,"You know, you look very familiar. Yeah, you ... you kind of look like that Avatar girl!"
15036,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Korra,I get that a lot.
15037,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Announcer,Whatever happened to her anyway?
15038,2,After All These Years,Balance,4,101,Korra,I wouldn't know.
15039,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Shiro Shinobi,"The Avatar has gone missing! Three years ago, Zaheer poisoned Korra, severely injuring her. While her friends moved on with their lives, Korra remained in the South Pole. Everyone thought she was still recuperating, but six months ago, Korra left home and hasn't been seen since. Even Chief Tonraq was shocked to learn that his daughter's whereabouts are unknown. What has become of the Avatar and when will she return?"
15040,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Knock yourself out.
15041,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Huh?
15042,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,You again.
15043,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"No, I-I don't need any help."
15044,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Bolin,"Now don't take this the wrong way, but, I can't wait for you to leave!"
15045,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Thanks. That's sweet.
15046,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Asami,Are you sure you don't want some company in the Southern Water Tribe? I'm happy to come with you.
15047,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"No ... I appreciate it, but I'll only be gone a couple of weeks. A little time alone will be good for me."
15048,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Tenzin,"Now, I don't want you to worry about a thing while you're gone. Your recovery should be your number one concern. Jinora, the airbenders, and I have everything under control."
15049,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Asami,"Bye, Korra!"
15050,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Mako,Get better soon!
15051,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Bolin,Don't forget to write!
15052,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Senna,"Can't sleep again? Honey, your father and I have tried to give you as much space as you've needed, but we're worried. You're not sleeping, you're barely eating. We don't want to push you, but it's been ''three weeks''. Will you ''please'' go see Katara?"
15053,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,All right ... I'll go.
15054,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Senna,You're going to get through this. I love you so much.
15055,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,The poison did a lot of internal damage.
15056,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Can you fix it?
15057,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,"I can help guide your healing process, but whether you get better or not, is up to you."
15058,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,"I know what it's like to go through a traumatic experience. And I promise you, if you dedicate yourself to getting better, you'll recover, stronger than ever."
15059,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,That's what I want. More than anything!
15060,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,Then try something for me. Concentrate on your big toe. Visualize it moving. Breathe.
15061,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Did you see that? It worked!
15062,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,"The mind can be a powerful ally, or your greatest enemy. Now, I want you to try taking a step."
15063,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,"You're okay. Your body thinks it is still in danger, but you're safe here. Use your mind to overcome the pain. Try again."
15064,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Asami,"Dear Korra. I miss you. It's not the same in Republic City without you. How are you feeling? Things are going well here. I just got a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, so I'll be keeping pretty busy for a while."
15065,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Bolin,"You will be most pleased to learn that I found gainful employment with Sir Varrick and the Lady Kuvira. I set off on the morrow with some trepidation, but I am eager to offer any aid I can in stabilizing the Earth Kingdom!"
15066,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,Whenever you're ready.
15067,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,What's the point? We've been at this for almost six months and I can still ''barely'' take a couple of steps without collapsing!
15068,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"''Of course'' I'm frustrated! A crazy man poisoned me and now I can't dress myself, or cook for myself, o-or do ''anything'' for myself! And this whole time, my friends have been off ''helping'' the world while I'm stuck with you ''and you can't even heal me''!"
15069,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,That came out wrong.
15070,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,It's ... all right. Let your anger and frustration ''flow'' like water.
15071,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"I am trying to understand ''why'' this happened to me, but nothing makes any sense! I'm tired, Katara. I'm ''so'' tired."
15072,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,"Korra, I know you feel alone right now. But you're not the first Avatar who's had to overcome great suffering. Can you imagine how much pain Aang felt when he learned that his ''entire culture'' was taken from him?"
15073,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,But he never let it destroy his spirit. He chose to find ''meaning'' in his suffering and eventually ... found peace.
15074,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,And ... what am I going to find if I ... get through this?
15075,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,I don't know. But won't it be interesting to find out?
15076,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,Close your eyes. Visualize yourself walking over to Naga. Can you see it?
15077,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Yes.
15078,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Katara,Now ... take that first step.
15079,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"Where'd you come from, little cutie?"
15080,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,How'd you do that?
15081,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,You want me to follow you?
15082,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,All right. Let's see what I find.
15083,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,It's ''so'' good to see you!
15084,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Tenzin,"How have you been, Korra? You look great!"
15085,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"I ''feel'' great! Come on, I want to show you how much better I'm doing."
15086,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Attack! I can take it!
15087,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Tenzin,All right! The sparring match is over!
15088,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,I thought I was ready.
15089,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Tenzin,There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery. Being the Avatar can wait.
15090,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Tenzin,The situation has been stabilizing since Kuvira took charge.
15091,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"But that should be ''me ''out there fixing things, not ''her''."
15092,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Tenzin,"I know you want to help. But trust me, everyone has this under control. I just think you need to ..."
15093,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"If you say, ""be patient"", I swear I'm gonna water-smack you in the mouth!"
15094,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Tenzin,"Nooo ... I was going to say, you need to ... not worry about the future. Be grateful for where you are now and the progress you've made."
15095,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"Dear Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written to you sooner, but every time I've tried, I never know what to say. The past two years have been the hardest of my life. Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State. I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day. Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head, so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover. Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them. I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff. I don't think they'd understand."
15096,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Senna,"Everything all right, sweetie?"
15097,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,There's something I need to tell you both.
15098,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Tonraq,What is it?
15099,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,I want to go back to Republic City.
15100,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Senna,Are you sure?
15101,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"I know I'm not a hundred percent yet, but I feel like I've hit a wall. I need to be where the action is, where my friends are."
15102,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"No, I want to go alone and have some time to clear my head. It'll be good for me."
15103,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"Two lobster crabs, please."
15104,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Fishmonger,"Why, you're the Avatar, ain'tcha?"
15105,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"Yup, that's me."
15106,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Fishmonger,"I can't believe it! Mind if I took a picture for my ""Wall of Avatars""?"
15107,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"Well, uhm, I'm kind of in a hurry."
15108,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Fishmonger,"I-it'll only take a second! Avatar Aang was a big fan of my seaweed wraps, you know, so, I named 'em ""Aang Rolls""! Now they're my biggest seller! And they ain't even got fish in 'em! Now, smile!"
15109,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Fishmonger,"But if I coulda met any Avatar, I'd have to pick Kyoshi. Taking down a shark squid with one hand! Now ''that's'' a lady I'd like to get to know!"
15110,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Vendor,Thieves! Get back here!
15111,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Hand over the bags or else.
15112,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Light spirit,"Everyone, come here! It's the Avatar!"
15113,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Skeptical spirit,"You sure? I don't sense any Raava energy around her. Besides, she's not dressed like the Avatar. And, doesn't the Avatar have ponytails?"
15114,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Light spirit,See? I told you guys it was her! How come you've been away so long?
15115,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,I was hurt pretty bad a while ago and lost touch with my Avatar Spirit.
15116,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Skeptical spirit,No wonder I couldn't feel Raava's energy.
15117,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"I came to the Tree of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again. But it's not working. The last time I was here, I saw ''all sorts'' of visions. Now I don't see anything."
15118,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Light spirit,Maybe we can help you get better.
15119,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"I'm sorry, but for years, people have been saying they can help me get better. Nothing's worked. I need to figure this out on my own."
15120,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,I am ending this.
15121,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Excuse me. Who do I talk to about getting in the ring?
15122,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Is that all you got?
15123,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Ring announcer,We have a ''winner!''
15124,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"Why did you bring me to the swamp? Wait, I met you at the Tree of Time. You should have told me who you were."
15125,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Light spirit,"If I did, would you have followed me?"
15126,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,I get your point. But why did you bring me here? What am I gonna find in the swamp?
15127,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Light spirit,"Not a ''what'', a ''who''."
15128,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"No, wait! Come back!"
15129,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,You're just in my mind. You're ''not'' real.
15130,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,''Help''!
15131,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Unknown woman,Feeling better?
15132,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,Where am I? Wha-what happened?
15133,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Unknown woman,I was hoping you could tell me. I found you passed out in the mud.
15134,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,How'd you know I was out there?
15135,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Unknown woman,"I'm pretty tapped into the goings-on around here. What brings you to the swamp, anyway?"
15136,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,A spirit led me here and told me I was supposed to find someone. Is that you?
15137,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Unknown woman,"Beats me. But if your Avatar senses called you here, you should probably listen to them."
15138,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Korra,"Wait, you recognize me?"
15139,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Unknown woman,In a manner of speaking. We were good friends in your previous life.
15140,2,Korra Alone,Balance,4,102,Toph,"Nice to see you again, Twinkle Toes."
15141,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Shiro Shinobi,"So much has changed these past three years! Mako is a bodyguard for the future Earth King, Prince Wu, while Bolin works for Kuvira, the Earth Kingdom's interim leader, who has brought stability to a nation plagued by chaos. Meanwhile, after wandering the world trying to heal herself, a spirit led Korra to the swamp, where she met Toph Beifong. Will this earthbending master be the key to Korra regaining her Avatar mojo?"
15142,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"So then the crowds are gathered, all excited to see ''my'' coronation, when all of a sudden, these ''boulders'' come rolling through. And guess what pops out of 'em? Earthbender dames! These gals start banging the boulders like drums, and sing the song of my royal lineage. It's the most dynamite six-hour show you'll ever see in your life."
15143,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"Shouldn't you be getting ready to, I don't know ... rule a whole nation?"
15144,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Now, now, now, don't get yourself in a ''tizzy''. I'll have ministers for all that! No, sir, Mako, when we get to Ba Sing Se, it'll just be two kooky pals, living the life!"
15145,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,Yay ...
15146,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Raiko,Getting excited for your big day?
15147,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,You sure that's the guy you want running the Earth Kingdom?
15148,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Raiko,Trust me. We'll be sending a delegation of experienced advisers to handle day-to-day governing.
15149,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Tenzin,I see the prince is becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership.
15150,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Raiko,You know royals. They love a ceremony. Have you received any word on the Avatar's location?
15151,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Tenzin,"Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the world on the lookout for her. I hope they find her soon. I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military. They say she's throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps."
15152,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Raiko,"Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow. We can worry about correcting any of her mistakes after that."
15153,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,And you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?
15154,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Raiko,"When Kuvira started cleaning up the Earth Kingdom, she knew her position wasn't permanent. She gave me her word that she'd step down."
15155,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Tenzin,"Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here."
15156,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,You got to help me get back into Avatar fighting shape. I'm getting my butt kicked by losers all over the Earth Kingdom. The world needs me.
15157,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,Get over yourself! The world doesn't need you one bit.
15158,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,"But, while I've been the Avatar, I've stopped some ''really'' bad people from doing some ''really'' bad things."
15159,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Listen, when I was Chief of Police in Republic City, I worked my ''butt'' off busting criminals. But did that make crime disappear? Nope. If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same."
15160,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,"So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless. And I thought Beifong was grumpy."
15161,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,I'm the original Beifong!
15162,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,So ... you're not going to train me?
15163,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Well, I was planning on soaking my feet in mud for a few weeks. But I can't stand you being so pathetic and getting your butt kicked all the time. All right, I guess I can help."
15164,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,Thank you!
15165,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Na-uh-uh-uh. You want to hug something, go hug a tree. We're here to work!"
15166,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,Hello Republic Cit-ay! Bolin ... is back! And ... Eska is also here.
15167,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Eska,"I see you have replaced me with a new girlfriend. Well done, she seems very threatening."
15168,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"Oh no no, that's Kuvira, she's kind of my boss."
15169,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Eska,"Boss, girlfriend. Same thing."
15170,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Cam,"I'm afraid there's been a mistake, Your Eminence. We have you and your brother booked in the same room, with only one bed."
15171,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Eska,It's no mistake. Desna sleeps in the tub.
15172,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Varrick,Never thought I'd be allowed back in the Republic City Four Elements. Raiko must have turned purple when Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes.
15173,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Zhu Li,"You're an upstanding citizen again, sir."
15174,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Varrick,Upstanding is right! And don't forget to fill the extra bag with as many of those little soaps as you can grab. Love the lavender scent.
15175,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,Bolin! Look at you! My little brother got all ... ''important''.
15176,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"I know, right? I see myself in the mirror sometimes and I think I'm in trouble before I realize: it's only me."
15177,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"So, what's it like working for Kuvira? From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh."
15178,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"Well, I've been working for Wu. And, uhhh ... Yeah."
15179,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"So, have you seen Korra yet?"
15180,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"No. She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he said she left the South Pole months ago. No one knows where she is."
15181,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Suyin,"Hello, Baatar Jr."
15182,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Suyin,"I don't know if I'd call marching all over the Earth Kingdom, forcing people to bow to Kuvira, ""doing good""."
15183,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Suyin,I'm just glad she'll be stepping down after tomorrow.
15184,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"I hope I'm not out of order saying this: You're pretty easy on the eyes for a military type. I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff, maybe get you a little upgrade. I've been living here for years, they love me."
15185,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,I won't be needing your help. We've reserved the presidential suite.
15186,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop! See, ''I'm'' in the presidential suite."
15187,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,Not anymore. I had you moved out.
15188,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Wait, what? Cam, where's all my stuff?"
15189,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Cam,We've moved you into a very nice ''junior suite'' on the seventh floor.
15190,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,Junior suite?
15191,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,Something you should know about me: I ''always'' get what I want.
15192,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Gun,"Your royal cabinet is here, your majesty!"
15193,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,Where have you been? My coronation is in ten minutes! Where's everyone else? Where are the Seven Sacred Chests of Exquisite Finery? Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?
15194,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Gun,"Sadly, most of your servants were scattered and the royal things were looted after the queen was removed from office. So your coronation may not have some of the usual items ... like ... the crown."
15195,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,There's no crown?! How can you have a coronation without a crown? How will people know when I'm officially the king?
15196,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,An earring?
15197,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Gun,Think of it more as a royal brooch.
15198,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Are you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles? No acrobat bell ringers, no horn blowing announcery guy?"
15199,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Gun,"It will be a very simple, intimate, elegant ceremony. A wonderful day for your kingdom. Just try on the brooch, Your Grace, you will see it looks beautiful ..."
15200,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,Don't ... ''touch me''.
15201,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Okay, bring it!"
15202,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,Tell me what you did wrong.
15203,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,"Well, I was thinking that you were ..."
15204,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,Exactly! You were thinking! Go again.
15205,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Pathetic. Of ''all'' the Avatar's I've worked with, you're by far the worst. I know that's only one other Avatar, but still."
15206,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,Gah! Hey! It seems like you're enjoying having someone around to beat up an awful lot.
15207,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Yeah, the swampbenders out here really can't take a punch."
15208,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,So ... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the world?
15209,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"I'm more connected to the world than you've ''ever'' been! The roots and vines ... they run all over the world. I can see Su and Lin, Zaofu and Republic City. I see everything. You're blind compared to me."
15210,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Gun,"Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty, King of all the Earth Lands and glorious defender of Ba Sing Se. Long may you reign!"
15211,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Thank you, for that incredibly brief, but very moving ceremony. I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen, who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne. One of them deserves special attention. Kuvira, rise! For your service to the realm, I would like to present you with the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest honor, which was somehow ''not'' stolen, unlike the royal pinky rings."
15212,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"Thank you. And if you don't mind, I would like to say a few words."
15213,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,Why not? We've got ''six hours'' to fill ...
15214,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"Growing up in Zaofu, with Suyin Beifong, I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic, and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward. It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray. It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages. I'd like to make an announcement to the world: the Earth Kingdom is no more. And from here on out, this man has no authority."
15215,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Wait, what? But I just got the royal brooch!"
15216,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"I have created a new Earth ''Empire'', and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for ''my'' people."
15217,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Crowd,"We love you, Kuvira! All hail the Great Uniter!"
15218,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing: Anyone who crosses our borders or stands in our way, will be ''crushed.''"
15219,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Crowd,"Thank you, Kuvira! All hail the Great Uniter!"
15220,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,Worst coronation ever.
15221,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,Were you surprised? Because I was ''really'' surprised. Won't this turn all the world leaders against us?
15222,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Varrick,"Relax, kid, what can they do? Kuvira controls the whole nation now, and Republic City is ''begging'' for the metal that we're mining. This train has left the station, and we own the track!"
15223,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Varrick,Now that's a nice looking hunk of spirit vine! Let's take it back to the lab and get it stabilized immediately.
15224,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"You look worried, Bolin."
15225,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"Yeah, well, I just have some misgivings about how you kind of ambushed Tenzin and the other leaders."
15226,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"You believe in the work that we've done for the people of the Earth Empire, right, Bolin?"
15227,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"I do, but ..."
15228,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,Then stick with me. I'm going to need your help now more than ever. Raiko and the other leaders want to bully us into accepting some idiot king who will serve them but neglect the people. We have to stand strong against them.
15229,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"I'm just not sure about this whole ""Empire"" thing. It seems pretty aggressive. And what was that part about the crushing?"
15230,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"That was just some ... tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business. Believe me, conflict is the last thing I want. Will you help me make history, Bolin?"
15231,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,I'll stand by you.
15232,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,Thank you.
15233,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Suyin,We need to talk.
15234,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"Can you give us the room, please?"
15235,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Suyin,"I met with the world leaders, and I've come as their representative."
15236,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"So ''now'' you're taking an interest in world affairs. A little late, isn't it? When the queen fell, and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu, and let others deal with the consequences."
15237,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Suyin,"That's hardly fair. I didn't want to seize power for myself, which is what you've done. I'm telling you for the good of everyone, you have to step down."
15238,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,I stepped ''up''. I provide stability and equality. Tell your world leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business. We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.
15239,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Suyin,What makes you so different? You're just another tyrant. And don't pretend the people put you where you are. I know what happens to cities who don't want to hand over control to you.
15240,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.
15241,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"First I lose my suite, then I lose my throne. My royal brooch is a ''lie!'' I know you must be crushed, not getting to come back to Ba Sing Se with me."
15242,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,Don't worry about me. I'll ... find a way to make it.
15243,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy. Okay. I just have to go on, move forward, take decisive action. Let's go shopping!"
15244,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,Ugh. Get rid of him. He's with ''her''.
15245,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,He's my brother.
15246,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"Interesting ceremony, huh?"
15247,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira now that she's going against the wishes of the entire world, are you?"
15248,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,You don't understand. Kuvira is helping out all the poor people of the Earth Empire. People like our family. This is for the best.
15249,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"I don't know, bro."
15250,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"Okay, why don't you come with me, and you'll see for yourself? We've done a lot of good, and Varrick is working on some new innovations. We're making ''history''."
15251,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"By ""crushing"" anyone who gets in your way?"
15252,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"''That'' was just some tough rhetoric to let the people know that we mean business. I mean, Kuvira is basically just like Korra. She might seem hard to deal with, but just because she's so passionate and believes in what she's doing."
15253,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,It seems like she's just a dictator who's taking the Earth Kingdom by force.
15254,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"Oh, okay, you think your new best friend in there would be a better leader than Kuvira?"
15255,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"Well, no, but still ..."
15256,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"Still what? Come on, Mako! I'm making a difference out there, what are you doing, huh? You're just some glorified butler for some snotty rich bozo!"
15257,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"I'm sorry, I don't want to work for your glorious emperor and her military dictatorship."
15258,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Bolin,"'''Fine'''! I'm going to go back to my awesome train, where we bring ''freedom'' where ever we go! Enjoy licking the king's boots in your ''junior suite!''"
15259,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Sorry, sport, I heard it all."
15260,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,I can't believe him!
15261,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,I know! Insulting another man's suite? It's beneath low. But I think I know what would cheer you up: a visit to Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall! I'll buy you a smoothie.
15262,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,Yeah. Okay.
15263,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,That was terrible.
15264,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Hah! Maybe for you. I had a great time! I never realized how much I missed tormenting the Avatar I wish you were putting up more of a fight, but it was still fun."
15265,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,You were tossing me around like a ragdoll all day long.
15266,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,''I know!'' And I'm an old lady! Imagine me in my prime! I would have ''destroyed'' you!
15267,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,"I just don't understand why I can't get back to my former self. It's like ... I'm a step slower. I'm tentative, I'm out of sync, I just can't get back in the groove."
15268,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,Probably carrying around that metal doesn't help.
15269,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,What metal?
15270,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body. Are you trying to tell me you can't feel metal ''in your own body?'' You really are the worst Avatar ever.
15271,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,I thought Su got it all out.
15272,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Oh, my girls never really picked up metalbending all that well, if you ask me."
15273,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,"That's been my problem this entire time! I gotta get it out! You can get it out for me, right?"
15274,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,Who do you think you're talking to?
15275,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"Once we're done with these, we can go into the Middle Ring and I'll let you pick out some new suits, then we'll hit the boutiques in the Upper Ring for me. Where did you get those shirts?"
15276,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"You can't sell that junk in here! This is the Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall, and I'm the Little King here! Respect the brooch!"
15277,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Crowd,"Stop it, Little King!"
15278,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,I am the Glorious Defender!
15279,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Crowd,I'm covered in juice! Get him!
15280,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,We need to get you out of here.
15281,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"It's destiny. Look where we are, Mako! ''The Royal Palace.''"
15282,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Little Boy,Hey! It's my birthday!
15283,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"It's my coronation day! You'll have another birthday next year, but I'll never have this day back again! ''Never''!"
15284,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"Okay, you're losing it."
15285,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,This is the worst day of my ''life''!
15286,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,"Why? Do you really ''want'' to be the king? I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator, but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth Kingdom somewhat better. If you were an Earth Kingdom citizen, do you think you're the kind of person you want as ''your'' king? What have you ever done for your people? I'm sorry, that was out of line."
15287,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,"No, you're right. No one ever talked to me like that before. I guess I'm just a joke who got what he deserved."
15288,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,Let's get you out of here and back to someplace safe.
15289,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Wu,Carry me?
15290,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Mako,No.
15291,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Okay, if you want me to bend out this metal, you need to relax."
15292,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,I am relaxed.
15293,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,''Seriously?'' Your body is like a twisted tree-trunk!
15294,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,Just do it! I'm ready.
15295,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax! Stop fighting me!
15296,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,I'm not fighting!
15297,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"All right, that's it. You're going to have to do this yourself. Clearly, you want to keep the metal in there."
15298,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,What do you mean? Why would I want poison inside me?
15299,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"I don't know! Maybe so you have an excuse not to go back to being the Avatar. If you don't get better, you can't do your job, so you don't have to worry about getting hurt again!"
15300,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"Whatever. When you want it out, you can bend it out. I can't deal with all your issues for you."
15301,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Korra,Wait! What am I supposed to do now?
15302,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Toph,"How should I know? Ask the spirit that brought you here. The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you, you picked the best swamp in the world!"
15303,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Tenzin,This ... is a mission of the utmost importance. Conflict is coming to the Earth Kingdom and we ''need'' to find the Avatar. Can I count on you three to bring Korra home?
15304,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Meelo,You can count on one of us. I don't know about ''these two ladies.''
15305,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Kuvira,"From now on, developing this technology is your number one priority."
15306,2,The Coronation,Balance,4,103,Varrick,This is going to change ''everything!.''
15307,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Shiro Shinobi,"After Korra failed to return to Republic City, everyone has been worried about her fate. So Tenzin tasked Jinora, Ikki and Meelo with finding the Avatar. Unbeknownst to the kids, Korra found refuge in the swamp with Toph, who discovered there was still metal poison in her body, but when Toph tried removing it, Korra resisted. Will the airbender kids find the Avatar and help her return to action?"
15308,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Pema,"Tenzin, are you sure you can't go with them?"
15309,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tenzin,Raiko asked me to stay here and help figure out a diplomatic solution to this Kuvira problem.
15310,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Mom, we'll be fine. Grandpa Aang and his friends were around our age when they traveled the world."
15311,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Pema,"Well, at least I don't have to worry about you starving out there."
15312,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Mom, we're going to be out in the wild, living off the land! We don't need your food!"
15313,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Pema,But I made your favorite treat ...
15314,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Sweet buns with happy faces on them? Well, I guess we're not officially on the road yet. Aww, this one is smudged. I can't eat this."
15315,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Pema,"You know, sometimes things get smudged in the wild."
15316,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tenzin,We're you able to get a read on Korra yet?
15317,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"No, but once we're further out, I'll be able to hone in on her spiritual energy. We should be able to find her within a few days."
15318,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tenzin,"Good luck! And be careful! Remember, Jinora's in charge!"
15319,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"I answer to no man. Or girl, even if she does have tattoos."
15320,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tenzin,Meelo ...
15321,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Now let's move out, soldiers!"
15322,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"Ugh ... Pepper, yip-yip!"
15323,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Finally! I've been holding my pee for an hour!
15324,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"If you get through to Korra, tell her I said hi. You feel anything yet? What's taking so long?"
15325,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"Ikki, I can't concentrate if you keep talking."
15326,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,Why don't you go play with some of those spirits?
15327,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Jinora's spirity powers are broken, and she doesn't know where Korra is."
15328,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,My powers are not broken. I just need more than two seconds and some quiet.
15329,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"While you try to pull yourself together, Poki and I are gonna go into town and find out if anyone has seen Korra."
15330,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Sounds like a good plan to me!
15331,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Enough chit-chat, you can hold the picture of Korra I drew."
15332,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Wow, I didn't know you could draw!"
15333,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"You don't know a lot of things about me, sister. Let's roll!"
15334,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Have you seen this woman?
15335,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Old lady,"Well, aren't you an adorable little thing."
15336,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,I'm not adorable! I'm ''dangerous''.
15337,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Old lady,Dangerously cute with those cheeks.
15338,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Aww.
15339,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,This. Never. Happened. Let's split.
15340,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Man ...
15341,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Can I trust you?
15342,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tuyen,I guess so.
15343,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,I'm on a top secret mission to find the Avatar. Have you seen her?
15344,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tuyen,"I haven't, sorry. Top secret mission, huh?"
15345,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Yeah, it's been ''pretty'' dangerous. I've seen some things."
15346,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tuyen,Really? What kind of things?
15347,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,''Craaazy'' things.
15348,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tuyen,Cool.
15349,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"I'm Meelo. What should I call you, other than ""beautiful""?"
15350,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tuyen,I'm Tuyen. Nice to meet you.
15351,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Ooh! Meelo's got a girlfriend!
15352,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Go away, Ikki!"
15353,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Jinora's been looking for you. We're moving on.
15354,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Tuyen,Looks like you got to get back to your mission. Good luck.
15355,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Thanks a lot, Ikki. You drove away the love of my ''life''."
15356,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Jinora! Ikki! It's Korra!
15357,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Where?! Where?! Where?!
15358,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,It's just a photo of Korra.
15359,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,At least it's something.
15360,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Fishmonger,"Pretty neat, huh? She came by here, about uh, six months ago."
15361,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Looks like someone just strummed up a good-old-fashioned lead. Then where did she go?
15362,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Fish monger,"Oh, I don't know. But she wasn't looking too good."
15363,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Ikki, this is all ''your'' fault."
15364,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,What? I didn't do anything.
15365,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Exactly! You need to start pulling your weight! That goes for you too, ''so-called'' leader!"
15366,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Remember when he used to be so nice and sweet?
15367,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,No.
15368,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,So ... what's the plan for today?
15369,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,You're looking at it.
15370,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"We didn't do anything yesterday, or the day before that. I know! Tell me the story of how you taught Aang how to earthbend."
15371,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"What's there to tell? I threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got all whiny and Sokka fell in a hole."
15372,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,I thought there'd be more to it than that. What about the time you took down the Fire Lord? That must have been ''epic''!
15373,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,Oh yeah. It was hot. I was on a blimp. And I think a giant turtle showed up. ''Wow''. What a day.
15374,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"Okay, you're terrible at telling stories."
15375,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,You're terrible at listening to them!
15376,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Quit making all that racket! If you're so anxious to do something, why don't you collect some mushrooms for dinner?"
15377,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,You got it.
15378,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Take the path until you see the boulder with the hole in it. Then go to your left. Oh, and make sure you get the big, slimy ones! They're the tastiest!"
15379,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Hey, where's all the food Mom gave us?"
15380,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,I threw it in the river.
15381,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,You did ''what''?! That food was supposed to last us ''two weeks''!
15382,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"Hey, keep it down! I'm trying to meditate."
15383,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Yeah, keep it down, Ikki."
15384,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Meelo threw away all our food!
15385,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"From now on, we ''hunt'' for our meals."
15386,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Meelo, we're vegetarians. We don't hunt!"
15387,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Enough whining. Poki and I will go find some grub.
15388,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"My name is Meelo. I like to throw away food and fart at inappropriate moments. I'm Jinora. I'm above it all because I'm meditating ''all'' the time. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there."
15389,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Wait! You dropped your breakfast!
15390,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Hey! Does this mean we're friends?
15391,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"No! I swear I'm not a spy. I've been traveling with my brother and sister. It's our first big mission and my dad, Tenzin, is counting on us. But if we don't find the Avatar, he's gonna be really disappointed."
15392,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Why do you want to know?
15393,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Where did you get those?
15394,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,My mom wrote those notes! That's ''our'' sack of food!
15395,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Who cares ... I don't want to see ''them''. I'd rather hang out here with you guys. Hit me with one of those macaroons.
15396,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,Are you okay?
15397,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Yep, totally fine! I hope you're hungry, because we found some ... We found some berries!"
15398,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,Looks like you got some bad berries. So much for living off the land.
15399,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"They're fine, I just ate too many of them because they're so ... so delicious."
15400,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,Did you run into Ikki while you were picking your poisonous berries?
15401,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"No, what? Did she run off or something?"
15402,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,I think so.
15403,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Great. Now I've got to go find the Avatar ''and'' her. This mission is getting worse by the day.
15404,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"This isn't only ''your'' mission, Meelo. I thought we were doing this as a family."
15405,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,It seems pretty lonely out here. Where's everybody else?
15406,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"It's tough to be left out, huh? I know ''exactly'' what you're going through."
15407,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Yeah. My brother and sister are always leaving me out of fun stuff. I mean, we're supposed to be looking for the Avatar ''together'', but they won't even let me help."
15408,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,What about this place?
15409,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"You're welcome, Ikki."
15410,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,We're saving you. Let's go.
15411,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"I had everything under control. I just found our food, ''and'' I have an idea where Korra is."
15412,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,You do? Then lets get going!
15413,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Hold on. Sorry my brother and sister knocked you out. Nice chatting with you!
15414,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,There you are. You got my dinner yet?
15415,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"No ... this swamp ... it did crazy things to my mind. I had visions, of all the times my enemies hurt me."
15416,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Yeah, I figured something like that might happen."
15417,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"''What''? You wanted me to see those visions? You are one ''twisted'' old lady, you know that?"
15418,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Look, I know you want to get better. And so does the swamp! It can sense you're out of balance. It will teach you what you need to learn, ''if'' you're open to listening."
15419,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"Okay, swamp. I'm all ears."
15420,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"You said you saw your past enemies. Now, why do you think that is?"
15421,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,I don't know. Because they made ''me'' and a lot of other people suffer.
15422,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Sounds like you're carrying around your former enemies, the same way you're still carrying around that metal poison. You maybe consider you could ''learn'' something from them?"
15423,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,Sounds like the swamp is messing with your mind too.
15424,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"My mind is just fine, thank you. Listen, what did Amon want? Equality for all. Unalaq? He brought back the spirits. And Zaheer believed in freedom."
15425,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,I guess ...
15426,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"The problem was, those guys were ''totally'' out of balance and they took their ideologies too far."
15427,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"Okay, fine. But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me."
15428,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,Because you need to face your fears. You can't expect to deal with future enemies if you're still fighting the ''old'' ones.
15429,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"Maybe you're right, but how am I supposed to move on?"
15430,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Boy, you Avatars sure need a lot of hand-holding. Get up! We're going to the banyan-grove tree."
15431,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Those soldiers said there weren't any troops here and, I figure, if Korra's not feeling good, she might come to a spiritual place like this to get better."
15432,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"There is an enormous amount of spiritual activity here, but I don't feel Korra."
15433,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Well, that's what we get for listening to ''Ikki''."
15434,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Guys! We just got here. Let's at least look around.
15435,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"I'm sorry, Ikki, but I'm with Meelo on this. I don't think we're going to find her here. Let's go Pepper!"
15436,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Why did those stupid vines pull us in here anyway?
15437,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Because they want us here. I'm telling you, Korra has got to be close."
15438,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"I don't know, Ikki, I still don't sense Korra."
15439,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Well, you haven't sensed her the entire time we've been looking for her!"
15440,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"Next time I go on a mission, it's going to be boys only. Just Poki and me."
15441,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,It's beautiful.
15442,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"The roots of the banyan-grove tree spread out for miles in every direction, connecting this whole swamp. Your problem is, you've been disconnected for too long. Disconnected from the people who love you and disconnected from yourself."
15443,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,I'm tired of listening to you!
15444,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo and Ikki,Yeah!
15445,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"I can't believe it! I saw Jinora, Ikki and Meelo, they're here!"
15446,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,Good. Hopefully they're here to take you home.
15447,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"We missed you so much, Korra."
15448,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"I missed you so much, too. How did you find me all the way out here?"
15449,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,Jinora sensed your energy.
15450,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,But we never would have been here if it weren't for Ikki.
15451,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,I never would have stormed off and run into those soldiers if it weren't for Meelo.
15452,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,"I was trying to toughen up these ladies, but I guess it was a team effort."
15453,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,I love your hair.
15454,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,It's ''so'' you.
15455,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"I'm so sorry. This is Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki. Aang and Katara's grandchildren."
15456,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,Your grandpa was a real pain in my butt.
15457,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,Wait a minute. Cranky? Old? Blind? You must be ''Toph''!
15458,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Oh, I like this one."
15459,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,"You need to come home, Korra. Kuvira is taking over the Earth Kingdom."
15460,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,You have to stop her.
15461,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,I don't know ... I'm not the Avatar I used to be. I can't even go into the Avatar State.
15462,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Ikki,"Please, Korra."
15463,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Jinora,The world needs you back.
15464,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,All right. I'm ready.
15465,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,I'm not bending it out of you. You've got to do this on your own.
15466,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Close your eyes. Clear your mind. And don't freak out, like last time! Now, focus your energy. Find the metal. Let it move through you body."
15467,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,That fight is over. Release the fear.
15468,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Well done, Korra."
15469,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Meelo,The Avatar is ''back'' in business!
15470,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Korra,"I feel so much lighter. Thank you ''so'' much for helping me. I'd like to give you a hug now, if that's okay with you."
15471,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"All right, you earned it."
15472,2,The Calling,Balance,4,104,Toph,"Finally, some peace and quiet."
15473,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Shiro Shinobi,"After three years, Kuvira has finally united the former Earth Kingdom states under her new Earth Empire banner! But one holdout remains: Zaofu. During that same time, Asami rebuilt the company her father created and helped redesign the city's infrastructure. And, most recently, the airbender kids found the Avatar! Korra rid herself of the residual poison in her body and is ready to return to action!"
15474,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Guard,We have an ''emergency!''
15475,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Baatar,I'll contact President Raiko. He'll send the United Forces.
15476,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,"Call whomever you want, but they'll never make it in time. Kuvira's already here and she brought her entire army."
15477,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,Don't get ahead of yourself. Securing your hometown won't be like every other city.
15478,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,''No''. The eyes of the world are on us now. We must do this ''right''. That's why we need Bolin.
15479,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,Su trusts him. She'll listen to him.
15480,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Jinora,Are you sure we should be going to Zaofu? Dad wanted us to bring you back to Republic City.
15481,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,"If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I. She needs to know that the Avatar is back. The ''world'' needs to know."
15482,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Meelo,'''Woo-hoo!''' ''Avatar fight!'' This is going to be '''awesome!'''
15483,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Meelo,What? ''No fight?'' Why did we go through all that trouble to save you if you're not going to beat someone up?
15484,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,Zhu Li! Is this thing on?
15485,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,"We're rolling, sir."
15486,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"Okay. I'm Varrick, of Varrick Industries, International-- --and this is Spirit Vine Experiment 3-02. Hand me the thing!"
15487,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"In this stasis capsule is a preserved spirit vine sample weighing approximately two ""Zhu Lis""."
15488,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"I have postulated that these spirit vines are a form of pure energy that's unstable in what we call-- --""typical earth conditions"". This machine should transfer the energy from the vine into a battery using electrical currents, reverse magnetic polarity, and a little-known phenomenon I like to call-- --''the Varri-Effect''!"
15489,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"It's working! It's registering five ""Varricks"" of power. Now ''seven'' Varricks!"
15490,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,Whoa! What is this? What's going on?
15491,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,Zhu Li! Shut it down! There are too many Varricks!
15492,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,Sir!
15493,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"You're too heavy! You know, you could stand to lose a few Zhu Lis!"
15494,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,"I think you're just weak, sir! ''Pull harder!''"
15495,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,Varrick ... you saved me.
15496,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,Of ''course'' I saved you.
15497,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,I can't clean this place up by ''myself!'' Grab a broom!
15498,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,What happened? Were we attacked?
15499,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,No! We were spirit-vined! But don't worry! I'm putting the kibosh on this project.
15500,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"No, you're ''not''. Do you realize what we could do with this kind of power?"
15501,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,Yes! I do! And that's why we gotta put an end to it! What if it fell into the wrong hands?
15502,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"I know, it's not like me, right? Usually I look at a project like this and think, ""Wow! I could make a ton of money off this!"" But recently, I've been having these strange feelings ... ''inside.'' It's like I'm ... concerned with others. And there's this nagging voice in my head constantly telling me what's right from wrong!"
15503,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,"I believe that voice is your conscience, sir."
15504,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Well, I'm the other voice in your head, and I'm telling you you will continue with this project."
15505,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"Sorry, no. I just really gotta stand my ground on this one-- Whoa!"
15506,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,And now there's a voice in ''my'' head telling me to drop you on the tracks. ''Should I listen?''
15507,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"''No! No! Head voices are liars, what do head voices know? I'll work on the project! Please don't drop me!''"
15508,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Hiroshi,"Asami, you came."
15509,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Asami,I came to return these.
15510,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Hiroshi,You never opened them.
15511,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Asami,Stop writing me. I never want to see or hear from you again.
15512,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Hiroshi,"''Please'', just let me say one thing, then I'll never contact you again."
15513,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Hiroshi,"I can't forgive myself for all the horrible things I've done. And I never expect you to forgive me. I tore our family apart, and destroyed our good name. But in a life of regret, you're the one thing I look back on that makes me smile. I just want you to know I'm so proud of you, Asami. You are the greatest thing I ever created."
15514,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,Am ... I in trouble?
15515,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"No. In fact, I have good news. We want you to be a part of our inner circle."
15516,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"It means you've proven your worth. We're so close to uniting the Empire, but Su has some resentment towards me and Baatar that might cloud her judgment and stop her from making a wise decision. We believe you can help her see clearly."
15517,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"I can do that! By the time I'm finished telling her all the great things we've done, she'll be begging to join!"
15518,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,Good. Because we're here.
15519,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,Aren't all these troops gonna send the wrong message?
15520,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,The army is here to project strength. You're here to present peace.
15521,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"Opal! You're here, too!"
15522,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Opal,No! You've chosen your side.
15523,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"''Sides?'' There shouldn't be sides! I know, why don't we all stand in a circle, huh? Maybe hold hands?"
15524,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,I'm not giving up Zaofu. I don't care if you brought your entire army.
15525,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Su, I didn't bring my army to threaten you. I wanted to show you all that your son and I have accomplished."
15526,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,You must realize what you're doing goes against everything your father and I tried to teach you.
15527,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Baatar,"Son, you belong here."
15528,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,Don't say that! Can't you see she's brainwashed you!
15529,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,''Ha!'' I didn't ''brainwash'' him! I set him free! And now he's accomplished more with me than he ever could with you.
15530,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"Okay, guys, obviously, there's a lot of personal, painful history here, so what do you say we just all forget about that stuff, huh? I mean, that's the past! Right Wing? Right Wei? You guys know what I'm talkin' 'bout, right? High five! All right. No, that's cool. You know what I think we need to do? Focus on the future! And the future is bright, let me tell you! I've seen it! Yeah! Saw it last month! We went to this town that had ''nothing.'' Most of the people there had never seen a Satomobile before. Now, they have ''two'' Satomobiles, running water, and a magnet train that goes right through their town! I mean, how awesome is ''that''?"
15531,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Opal,"They might have been happy when you first arrived, but I've seen what happens after you leave. Citizens are forced to work as slave labor, dissenters are sent off to who-knows-where!"
15532,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"You're wrong, Opal! Now, I don't know what you think you've seen, but I am giving you the one-hundred-percent Bolin guarantee that we're making the Earth Empire a better place to live!"
15533,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,I can't believe you brought Bolin here to try and sway us. ''Leave!'' Zaofu will never accept you as their leader!
15534,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Then you leave me no choice. You have twenty-four hours to agree to join the Empire, ''or we take the city by force.''"
15535,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,"Oh, no. I hope we're not too late."
15536,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,"I'll tell you the whole story later. Right now, I want to help you stop Kuvira. What can I do?"
15537,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"You were just bluffing, right? I mean, you're not really gonna attack Zaofu ... are you?"
15538,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"When people don't cooperate, we must find other ways of convincing them to join."
15539,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"''Other'' ... ways? How many ... times have we used these ""other ways"" in the past?"
15540,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,It's not for you to worry about.
15541,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"So, uh ... what ''does'' happen to all those towns and villages after we leave? I just realized I'd never really ... gone back and ... checked on them."
15542,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Those people are my loyal subjects, and they contribute to the Empire however I see fit. Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths."
15543,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"Maybe ... I'm not really an ""inner circle"" kind of guy. Or--or maybe, we don't take over Zaofu! Maybe we can just--let them be on their own, and then, ""Yay! The Empire's united! Congratulations to us!"""
15544,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,I didn't know your personal feelings for Opal were stronger than your loyalty to me. Zaofu ''will'' join us. The only thing I'm second-guessing is my decision to bring you along. Maybe you need to spend some time in a reeducation camp.
15545,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,I ... thought that's where we sent people to learn new trade skills.
15546,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,Your loyalty seems to be wavering.
15547,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"No--no, I'm totally on your side, completely, one-hundred-percent loyal."
15548,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,How did things get so bad between you and Kuvira? I thought she was your protégé.
15549,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,"She was more than that. She was like a daughter to me. I took her in when she was eight years old and nourished her talents. Kuvira was smart, a natural leader, and quickly rose through the ranks. I saw myself in her."
15550,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,What happened?
15551,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,"Three years ago, after the fall of the Earth Queen, Raiko and Tenzin came to see me."
15552,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Raiko,"The Earth Kingdom is in chaos. There's a vacuum of power, and I'm concerned about what will happen if someone doesn't take control of the situation."
15553,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,And you think ''I'' should be the one?
15554,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Tenzin,"You're the perfect person to take charge. The world leaders trust you, and, as a Beifong, you have credibility in the Earth Kingdom."
15555,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,"I'm honored that you thought of me, but I'm not interested in imposing my ideals on an entire nation. I'm afraid I can't help you."
15556,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Suyin, I know this isn't my place, but I think you should do this. Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone."
15557,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,What would you have me do? March into Ba Sing Se with an army? We'd be seen as conquerors and greeted with nothing but war.
15558,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,There are already wars. The Earth Queen nearly destroyed our nation. This is our opportunity to change things.
15559,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,It's not going to happen.
15560,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,"I didn't realize it at the time, but that moment put a rift between us. Kuvira turned my own son against me, and together they plotted behind my back."
15561,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,What do you think you're doing?
15562,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,We're doing what you don't have the guts to do: We're going to Ba Sing Se to help bring order back to the Earth Kingdom.
15563,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,No! You will stay here!
15564,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"And who's going to stop me? Your security force was more than happy to join my cause. They're some of the best fighters in the world, and they are tired of being treated like exotic birds in your cage."
15565,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,"''If'' you leave now, you will never be welcomed back."
15566,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"When I choose to return, it'll be on my own terms."
15567,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,"Kuvira and Baatar left that day with Varrick, my security force, and a few of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens. After Kuvira proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se, Raiko and the other world leaders made her the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom. When she refused to step down, I knew it was only a matter of time before she made her way back here."
15568,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,I want to fix this.
15569,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,You can. Go into the Avatar State and demolish her entire army. Remove Kuvira from power once and for all.
15570,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,Fighting is something the ''old'' me would do. That always made things worse. Let me talk with Kuvira. Maybe I can reason with her.
15571,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Suyin,Kuvira doesn't listen to reason.
15572,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"I can't believe Kuvira locked me in here like a ''prisoner''! I'm not feeling well! I think I'm running out of air! Zhu Li, hold your breath!"
15573,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,I'm not holding my breath.
15574,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,''Great''! Now we're both gonna die!
15575,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,Varrick? Varrick?!
15576,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,''Ahh!'' And the head voices are back!
15577,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,Bolin! Thank goodness you're here! Where did that hatch come from? ''Forget the hatch!'' There's something important I gotta tell ya!
15578,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"Well, there's something important I gotta tell you, too!"
15579,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick and Bolin,Kuvira's crazy!
15580,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,How'd you find out?
15581,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"When I refused to build her a superweapon, ''she threatened my life!''"
15582,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"She threatened me, too! And she's threatening Zaofu and it turns out, she's been threatening villages this whole time! We gotta get outta here."
15583,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"I couldn't agree more, kid."
15584,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Korra, it's such an honor to see you again. The last I heard, you were still healing in the South Pole."
15585,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,"Well, I'm feeling much better now."
15586,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,That's wonderful news.
15587,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,I'm here to ask you to back down. Please. Take your army and leave.
15588,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,I think we both know that's not going to happen.
15589,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,I can't let you take Zaofu.
15590,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Look, I was tasked with bringing stability to the Earth Kingdom. Zaofu is the last holdout. Why should I treat it differently than any other state?"
15591,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,What you're doing isn't right!
15592,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"I understand you're just trying to do Su a favor, but you can't come to me as I am on the verge of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop. The world was descending into chaos while you were gone. In order to fix it, I had to make some tough decisions."
15593,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,I know what that's like. I've had plenty of people mad at me about decisions I've made.
15594,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Exactly. Korra, if you really want to help, go back to Su and ''try'' to talk some sense into her. Let's call a temporary truce. I won't make any moves until you talk to her and get back to me."
15595,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,Maybe that ''will'' be for the best.
15596,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"Okay, I say we go up and around the mountains-- --and sneak into Zaofu from the rear."
15597,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"We're not going to Zaofu, that place is ''doomed''! We gotta head to Republic City!"
15598,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"What? No, nonono, we gotta help ''here''."
15599,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,We'll be helping by warning the world about Kuvira's potential ''superweapon!''
15600,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,"Well, that's helping, but it's a completely different type of helping. ''Hmm''. Let me think about this."
15601,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,That's not ''the flamethrower!'' What ''idiot'' designed these things?
15602,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,"You did, sir!"
15603,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"Less lecturing, more saving my life!"
15604,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,Hey! I think I figured it out!
15605,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,"Sir, you're making this very difficult."
15606,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"Thanks a ''lot'', Zhu Li."
15607,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Hiroshi,You came back.
15608,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Asami,"When I first came here, it was because I wanted to tell you ''face to face'' that I never wanted to see or hear from you again. I wanted my words to hurt you so that you would know how you hurt me."
15609,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Hiroshi,I'm sorry.
15610,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Asami,"But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt. It was sadness. You tainted our past and destroyed our future together."
15611,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Hiroshi,I want to make amends.
15612,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Asami,I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.
15613,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Asami,I thought we could play some Pai Sho. Like we used to.
15614,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Hiroshi,Nothing ... would make me happier.
15615,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Bolin,Don't ... torture us.
15616,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"Send these three away on the next train. Bolin and Zhu Li will be going to the reeducation camp for our most severe dissenters. And ''you'' will continue work on the spirit-energy project, under close, ''armed'' supervision. I want it weaponized immediately."
15617,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,Please! Have mercy on me! Don't send me away! ''Take me back!''
15618,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,Why would I?
15619,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,"Because my only mistake was being loyal to the wrong person. I was blindly devoted to Varrick, and I looked past all the times he ''ridiculed'' me, or ''ordered me around'', or made me clean his ''disgusting feet''-- --because I thought he possessed the most brilliant mind in the world. But when I met you, I realized I was wrong. Compared to you, Varrick's a fool."
15620,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,"Hey, come on! I'm right here!"
15621,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,"I believe in everything you've done, and I believe in your vision. I want to devote my life to you. I pledge my allegiance to you, Great Uniter."
15622,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Kuvira,"You two could learn something from her. Rise, Zhu Li. I'll give you another chance."
15623,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,Think about what you're doing! We're partners! We have ''history!''
15624,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Zhu Li,"I did everything you ever asked of me, and you never appreciated it! Guards, ''do the thing!''"
15625,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Varrick,No! Not the ''thing''! ''Zhu Li!''
15626,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,Where's Su? I have to talk to her.
15627,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Baatar,She's not here. She took Wing and Wei. They're going to sneak into Kuvira's camp and put ''an end'' to this.
15628,2,Enemy at the Gates,Balance,4,105,Korra,''No!''
15629,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Shiro Shinobi,"Kuvira threatens to take Zaofu by force! After tensions flared between Su Beifong and her former protégé, Korra brokered a truce, but it was too late. Su and her sons were already on their way to put an end to Kuvira. Meanwhile, Bolin and Varrick learned of Kuvira's true tyrannical intent and deserted her army, but they were captured and betrayed by Zhu Li. Now they're being held against their will!"
15630,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Wing,"Are you sure this will work? Even without Kuvira, they could still crush us."
15631,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Suyin,"Most of this army has been forced into service by Kuvira. If we take her out, they'll have no reason to fight. Tonight we end her reign of terror."
15632,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Suyin,She's alone in there. Now's our chance!
15633,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Zhu Li,Don't hurt me!
15634,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Suyin,Zhu Li?
15635,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"I knew you'd try a sneak attack. You were afraid to step up and lead the Earth Kingdom when you had the chance. You were afraid to join me when I became the leader, and now, you're afraid of a fair fight. You've always been a coward. Take them!"
15636,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Jinora,"Korra, you have to go stop Su before she does something terrible."
15637,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,"Stop her, we should be helping her."
15638,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,"We have no idea where your mom is, or what her plan is. If we go charging into Kuvira's camp, we could get them all captured, or worse. All we can do now is wait."
15639,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"Attention citizens of Zaofu. Your leader, Su Beifong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept, ignoring the terms of our truce. Luckily, I now have her and her assault team in custody."
15640,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,''No.''
15641,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"Rest assured that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, unless your remaining representatives meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full and unconditional surrender of your city. That is all."
15642,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,"Korra, you can't let Kuvira get away with this! We have to go break out Mom and my brothers!"
15643,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,I don't care about the oath! I have to save my family!
15644,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,"No, Jinora is right. Your mom attacked the camp. Kuvira was just defending herself."
15645,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,"''""Defending herself""?'' She was going to attack our city! I can't believe you're refusing to fight!"
15646,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Meelo,Why is that loudspeaker lady talking when I'm trying to ''sleep''?
15647,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Baatar,"Korra, what are we going to do?"
15648,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,"Jinora and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and, maybe, we can work something out. I promise, I'll do everything I can to keep the peace."
15649,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,I'll go with you.
15650,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Ikki,"We'll go, too."
15651,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Jinora,"No! Dad told us to find Korra, and we did. Now you need to stay safe."
15652,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Ikki,Come on! Let us help!
15653,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,I can't risk anyone else being captured. You can stay with Baatar and Huan while I work things out with Kuvira. Make sure they get back to Tenzin if anything goes wrong.
15654,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Meelo,"Aw, man! When am I gonna see some ''action''?"
15655,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,Cookie ... jar ... empty. No ... hot ... towels! Waxy ... buildup! ''Zhu Li''!
15656,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,Oh ... she really ''is'' gone.
15657,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,Zhu Li always greeted me in the morning with a a hot cup of tea.
15658,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Well, I'm really only productive for about fifteen minutes a day, usually in the afternoon around three-forty-five."
15659,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,What's goin' on?
15660,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"I can't be expected to work without an assistant! Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless!"
15661,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Well, I guess he'll be fine. As long as he doesn't need his ''hands'' afterwards!"
15662,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"The last time we worked with the spirit vines, it created an ''uncontrollable blast'' that burned through a wall and could still be blowing up comets in space, as far as I know! I wouldn't want to assist me if ''I'' were you!"
15663,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,"Wait, what? I need my hands! Uh, hold on! Can we have breakfast first? While we still have hands?"
15664,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,Release them now!
15665,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"If Su agrees to bow to me and turn over Zaofu, she and the rest of your family will not be harmed."
15666,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Suyin,''Never!'' I'll never bow to you!
15667,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,There must be some way for us to resolve this!
15668,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"I've already laid out my terms, and I think they're very reasonable. After all, Su did try to take me out during our ''peaceful ''negotiations."
15669,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Wei,"You call bringing an army to threaten our city ""peaceful""?"
15670,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,Where's Bolin? I know he would never go along with this!
15671,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"Bolin is with my fiancé, working on something very important. But, I assure you, he's on board with my plans. You two have been apart for some time. I guess you don't realize how much Bolin has grown up. Now ''turn over Zaofu''."
15672,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,I can't just let you take the city!
15673,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"Avatar Korra, you are interfering with internal Earth Empire business, and letting your ''personal'' feelings get in the way of reason. Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself. They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long. I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation. This is about equality."
15674,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,You don't care about equality! This is about control! Just take her down! You know it's the right thing to do! You have to stop this!
15675,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,The ''only way'' you're going to keep me from marching into Zaofu is if you ''physically'' stop me. Now what are you going to do?
15676,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,It looks like you're not giving me a choice.
15677,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,"Fine. You wanna fight the Avatar? Then let's finish this, ''right here, right now.''"
15678,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Jinora,Are you really ready to fight her?
15679,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,"Just stay back and let me handle this. It's been a while, but I got a lot of pent-up rage."
15680,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,"No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort."
15681,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Jinora,Be careful.
15682,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,Enough talk!
15683,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,Looks like the Avatar's a little off her game!
15684,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,Don't let her get you frustrated! She wants you to make a mistake!
15685,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Bolin, do the thing."
15686,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,What thing?
15687,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,''The thing''! I never had to tell Zhu Li what ''thing''!
15688,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,"I'm not Zhu Li, okay? Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here, also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands ''blown off!''"
15689,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"You know, when I started working with the vines, the point was to find a clean, unlimited source of energy, not develop some spirity death ray."
15690,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,Clean energy! Sounds ''great''! Who doesn't like that stuff? Let's do ''that'' instead!
15691,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,How would you know? You couldn't discover a wolfbat if it was building a nest in your butt.
15692,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Ooh. You got me there, Dr. Science. You'll never know how it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped, and raised by ''fools''!"
15693,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Okay, okay, The last time we ran the current through the vine we couldn't control the power, so I'm trying something new to see if I can ''direct'' it."
15694,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"Come on, Avatar, get up! Show me what you've got!"
15695,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,We have to help her!
15696,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Korra,No! Stay back! I can handle this.
15697,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Hand me the ... screw-turn-thingy, would ya?"
15698,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,"Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them, you know this isn't right."
15699,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Funny story, Bolin. I first got the idea for harnessing spirit power when I watched that giant Unalaq-monster attack the city from my jail cell. That giant monster set me free! Trust me, kid, I know what I'm doing. That ought to do it. Huh. Okay, stand back. There we go!"
15700,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,That's the timer.
15701,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"For the ''bomb'', of course!"
15702,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,What?! What bomb?
15703,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"The ''bomb'' that's gonna explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train, all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards."
15704,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you. This is the first time I've built a timer and it might run a little ''fast.'' Bolin and I are ready to go down with the ship, or ''train'', in this case, but you seem like you have a lot to live for."
15705,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,"Nononono! I'm not ready to go down with the ship, ''or the train''!"
15706,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Stick around five minutes and you'll find out who's bluffing. You'll be sorry you left me, Zhu Li! When they write the history books, your name will be synonymous with ''betrayal''! People will say, ""Hey, what happened to that guy? Oh, didn't you hear? He 'Varricked' himself because some girl 'Zhu Li'd' him!"""
15707,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"You try to pull me away from this thing and I'll hit this remote, and blow it immediately!"
15708,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Well, first, I built the timer, but then I thought, you could drag me off the train, so then I built a remote, but then I thought, do I really need the timer, because now I got a remote in my-- ''Whatever!'' I'm covering all my bases! The point is, you're leaving, we're staying!"
15709,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Suyin,You have to go into the Avatar State! ''Do it!''
15710,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,I knew you were weak.
15711,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,You broke our agreement! Attack!
15712,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Jinora,"Keep them back, I'm calling for help!"
15713,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Huan,"Stunning work, Ikki. It hurts my eyes with its ... raw, emotional power! Ugh, pedestrian. I already know what you look like on the outside, I want you to show me, the ''inner'' Meelo!"
15714,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Jinora,Help! You have to get Korra and the rest of us out of here now! Hurry!
15715,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Meelo,Finally! Let's get it on!
15716,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,"That's everyone, our half of the train is clear."
15717,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"That's good, we're almost out of time."
15718,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,"Man, that was great! I gotta admit, you had me going there for a while, I really thought you were gonna blow us up! Now, how do we turn this thing off?"
15719,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"Ooh, we can't turn it off. We're gonna blow up-- --but, we had a pretty good run, right?"
15720,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,"What are you talking about, ""a good run""? I'm still running! I like running!"
15721,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"I'll see you on the other side, Zhu Li."
15722,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,"I want you to know, ''I hate you''."
15723,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Varrick,"''Yes''! You did it, Bolin, you did the ''thing''!"
15724,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Bolin,I can't ''believe'' Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did.
15725,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Meelo,"Dive, Pepper, dive! Here comes a hurricane! You can't handle all this Meelo!"
15726,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Jinora,"We've got her, go!"
15727,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,We have to save them!
15728,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Suyin,"Opal, get out of here, we'll be fine! Just go!"
15729,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Opal,I'll be back for you! ''I love you!''
15730,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,Zaofu is ours!
15731,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"Bring the citizens of Zaofu to kneel before the Great Uniter! All who pledge their loyalty to me will keep their freedom and will be dealt with fairly as full citizens of the Earth Empire. The rest will be imprisoned as traitors, like Su Beifong and her sons. Now ''bow''!"
15732,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Baatar,"I am ''so'' disappointed in you, Junior."
15733,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Huan,Get your hands off me! You're crushing my individuality!
15734,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,"Are you sure, there's no way they survived?"
15735,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,How would you like to help Baatar build the most powerful weapon the world has ever seen?
15736,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Zhu Li,"It would be my honor, Great Uniter."
15737,2,The Battle of Zaofu,Balance,4,106,Kuvira,Begin dismantling the domes.
15738,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Shiro Shinobi,"Kuvira has defeated the Avatar and now controls the entire Earth Empire. Luckily, the airbender kids and Opal rescued Korra and escaped Zaofu. For the first time in three years, Korra will finally be back in Republic City! Meanwhile, Varrick and Bolin escaped from Baatar Jr. and are on the run. But will they make it back to the city in time to warn everyone about Kuvira's new spirit energy super weapon?"
15739,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Naga!
15740,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"I missed you so much, girl!"
15741,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Meelo,Mom! Dad! We're back! And we got Korra!
15742,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bumi,Aren't you a sight for sore eyes! Bum-Ju and I sure missed you.
15743,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"It's so great to see you again, Bumi. And you too, Bum-Ju."
15744,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Tenzin,Well done kids! I'm proud of you all for finding Korra.
15745,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Meelo,Proud enough to get me my tats?
15746,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Tenzin,No.
15747,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Tenzin,Welcome home.
15748,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"I missed you, Tenzin."
15749,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Tenzin,"Now, I hate to get right down to business, but I want to hear what happened in Zaofu."
15750,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bumi,Way to ruin the moment.
15751,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Opal,"Kuvira's whole army was there. She captured Mom, Dad, and my brothers."
15752,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,I thought I was strong enough to stop her. I feel like such a failure.
15753,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Tenzin,No one expected you to handle Kuvira on your own. It's up to all of us to find a way to deal with her. We're just glad to have you back.
15754,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bumi,"Where's Bolin? He's not still on Kuvira's side, is he?"
15755,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Opal,I can't believe he would stay with her after what she did to my family. But we don't know where he is.
15756,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,How about you use your own legs for a while?
15757,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"You know, when I fled Republic City with Zhu Li, she carried me twenty miles in one day. And that was after she sprained her ankle."
15758,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"Well, Zhu Li's not here, okay?"
15759,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"That's fine, leave me here, let the worms gobble me up. I deserve it."
15760,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"No way mister! You're not getting off that easily. You're responsible for that weapon Kuvira is trying to make. Which, may I remind you, could hurt a lot of people."
15761,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"No, don't remind me! I know, I'm a horrible, ''horrible'' person!"
15762,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"Okay, look. Kuvira fooled us both into doing her dirty work and I'm not happy about it either. ''But'', you know how we're gonna make it up to the world? By getting back to Republic City and warning everyone what she's up to! So, I want you to take my hand and march with me out of this forest!"
15763,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"You really have a way with words, kid. No wonder I made you a mover star. All right, I'll take the driver's seat for a while, hop on."
15764,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"Oh, great, my feet could use a break."
15765,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"Oh, boy, here we go!"
15766,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,Are you ''kidding'' me?!
15767,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,I hope you haven't been waiting long.
15768,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,Only three years. It's so good to see you again.
15769,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,You too.
15770,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,And I'm loving the hair.
15771,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Thanks. You're looking snazzy as always.
15772,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,Come on. Mako got us a table at the restaurant.
15773,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Korra!
15774,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"Hi, Mako."
15775,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Hello there, Prince Wu, rightful heir to the throne and this guy's boss. I bet he's told you a lot about me."
15776,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Nope. Not a thing.
15777,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Then we have ''so'' much to talk about. You are going to ''love'' the food here, I know the chef personally. Let's start with a round of your spicy octopus fritters and keep the cucumber-aloe water coming! Gotta keep this princely skin hydrated."
15778,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Sorry, but I couldn't ditch him. But he promised to be on his best behavior."
15779,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Hey, pop into the Avatar State for me. I want to see your eyes glow."
15780,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,What? No!
15781,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,So can you go into the Avatar State again? I was worried when you told me you couldn't.
15782,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Wait, when did she tell you she couldn't? What's going on with you two?"
15783,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,I wrote to Asami while I was away. I asked her not to tell you. I'm sorry.
15784,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Well, why didn't you ever write to me? Or Bolin?"
15785,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,I don't know. I guess ... I didn't know what to say.
15786,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"""Hello"" would have been nice."
15787,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Mako, if it makes you feel any better, she didn't write me either."
15788,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Why would she ... Never mind.
15789,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch, but I'm back now. And I wanna know everything about what's been going on with you two."
15790,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,"Well, I kind of have some big news. I went to visit my father for the first time. He had been writing me letters and I guess I finally felt ready to try and forgive him."
15791,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,You sure you can trust him? He might just be manipulating you again.
15792,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,You think I don't know what my ''own father'' is capable of?
15793,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"No, I didn't mean ..."
15794,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,You don't get to disappear for three years and then act like you know what's best for me!
15795,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"It's not like I planned to be gone for that long, I wanted to come back, but I never felt ready until now."
15796,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"As much as I'm enjoying this little catch-up, my royal bladder is about to ''explode''. Mako, come on, I need you to stand guard."
15797,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"I'm not gonna hold your hand every time you have to empty your ""royal bladder"". Go to the bathroom on your own for once."
15798,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,Fine.
15799,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Do you always go to the bathroom with him?
15800,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"I don't go ''with'' him, with him, I just stand there in the general vicinity while he ... I don't wanna talk about it."
15801,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bathroom attendant,"Good afternoon, Sir. Perhaps a spritz of cologne, to freshen up?"
15802,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Make it a double, buddy!"
15803,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Mako, help! Wu ... down ..."
15804,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,I wish Pabu were here. He could just chew us out of this.
15805,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,You know who else has incisors sharp as a knife? Zhu Li ...
15806,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Ahnah,Well look what we caught. Wonder if they were tracking us after we escaped.
15807,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,Hello fellow travelers! I don't suppose you can help us out of this net?
15808,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Ahnah,Why would we free a couple of lowly Earth Empire soldiers?
15809,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,''Lowly''? We were part of Kuvira's inner circle!
15810,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"Were, not anymore! Please, just, let us out!"
15811,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,I know just what to do with a couple of Kuvira's top men.
15812,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,I wonder what's taking Wu so long. He's not one to miss out on lunch. I'll go check on him.
15813,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Wu, are you in here? Come on, your octopus fritters are getting cold."
15814,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,I'll be right back.
15815,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"Excuse me, did you happen to see if Prince Wu came out this way?"
15816,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bathroom attendant,"Sorry miss, I haven't seen him."
15817,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Hmm, I'm in laundry ..."
15818,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"They've got Wu! Get the car, I'm going after them!"
15819,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,Get in!
15820,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,We're losing them!
15821,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Hang a right at the next block. We can cut them off on Seventh.
15822,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,You missed the turn! Where are you going?!
15823,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,I know these streets better than you. I built some of them!
15824,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,What are you doing? Sit down!
15825,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Where is he?
15826,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Wu's not here. This guy was the only one in the truck.
15827,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Where's the prince?
15828,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bathroom attendant,Halfway to Kuvira by now. All hail the Great Uniter.
15829,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,They must have moved Wu to a different vehicle when we lost sight of them.
15830,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Take this guy in for booking. Charge him with kidnapping and tell Chief Beifong that Prince Wu is missing. Put out an all-points bulletin. We'll keep looking.
15831,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,Where do we start? There are ''thousands'' of cars in the city and he could be in any one of them.
15832,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Or they might try smuggling him out on an airship.
15833,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,Or maybe a boat.
15834,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,He could be anywhere! The ''one'' time I don't watch him pee and ''this'' is what happens.
15835,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,They're taking Wu to the train station!
15836,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,Are you sure? How do you know?
15837,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"I'll explain on the way, just drive! We're running out of time!"
15838,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,So how did a bunch of water and firebenders end up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps?
15839,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Ahnah,Call it what it is: a prison.
15840,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,Kuvira's been purging states of anyone who's not of Earth Kingdom origin and locking them up.
15841,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,Purging?!
15842,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,"What are you acting so surprised for? You must have known what she was up to, being part of her ""inner circle"" and all."
15843,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"No, I swear! And the inner circle thing lasted like, less than a day!"
15844,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,Will you ''at least'' tell us where you're taking us?
15845,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,The border checkpoint. You're gonna help us talk our way past some Earth Empire soldiers.
15846,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Ahnah,"And once we're through, we'll see about letting you go."
15847,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,Lava time! Bet you didn't expect that!
15848,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"Look, I'm sorry for what happened to all of you, but as I've been trying to explain, we don't work for Kuvira anymore."
15849,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"Yeah. If our handsome mugs get recognized trying to go through that checkpoint, we're goners!"
15850,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,"If you really are fugitives, you better listen up. We've been scouting this region for days. There's a wall stretching along the entire border and patrols guarding every part of it. That checkpoint is the only way out."
15851,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Ahnah,"It's not worth the risk, Baraz. How do we know they won't turn us in?"
15852,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,"If he wanted us gone, we'd be at the bottom of a pool of lava right now. If any of us want to get out of the Earth Empire alive, we'll have to trust each other."
15853,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"All right, where is this checkpoint?"
15854,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"So, how do you know where Wu is just by touching some spirit vines?"
15855,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,I learned how to connect to people's energies through them.
15856,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,Who taught you that?
15857,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"Lin's mom. I found her in the swamp, that place is like one giant spirit wild."
15858,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,You met ''Toph''? What was she like?
15859,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"A cranky, more miserable version of Lin."
15860,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Is that even possible?
15861,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,You'd be surprised.
15862,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Which train is Wu on?
15863,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,I don't know!
15864,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,Split up and start looking.
15865,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,Follow my lead.
15866,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Guard post soldier,"Good afternoon, sir. Can we help you?"
15867,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,You sure can. We captured these escaped prisoners. We need to get them to a secure facility.
15868,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Guard post soldier,Where did they escape from?
15869,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,Camp fourteen.
15870,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Guard post soldier,Then why are you bringing them through here? Camp fourteen is the other way.
15871,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,You think we don't know where Camp fourteen is? ''Kuvira'' wants them transferred.
15872,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Guard post soldier,Then I'll need to see the transfer order.
15873,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"Listen pal! I had to fight off two badgermoles, six wolfbats and eighteen hog monkeys to capture these guys, so sorry if I don't have the paperwork! I was too busy cramming it in a hog monkey's mouth, while it was trying to eat me! I am in ''sore'' need of a shower and I have blisters that are the size of cantaloupes and twice as juicy! So you can let us through, or you can give us your name and rank and I'll make sure to pass it on to Kuvira! You know what happens to soldiers who question ''her'' orders, don't you? ''Bad stuff!''"
15874,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Guard post soldier,Let them through!
15875,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,There's no way I'm going back to prison!
15876,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"Boy, I sure hope this works."
15877,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"I still got that Varrick touch! We're clear, come on!"
15878,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"Varrick, wait, we can't leave them!"
15879,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Guard post soldier,Retreat!
15880,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,Thanks. You didn't have to come back.
15881,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,Yeah. I kind of did. Let's go!
15882,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Over the PA,The 4:15 bound for Omashu is now leaving on track number six. All aboard!
15883,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,"If we don't find Wu soon, we might never find him."
15884,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,He's on that train!
15885,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,How do you know for sure he's here?
15886,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"I don't. But I had a feeling, okay?"
15887,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"And I'm just supposed to trust your ""Avatar Feelings""?"
15888,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared."
15889,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,It's certainly not mine!
15890,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,"Guys, shh. Listen."
15891,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Wu! Wu, it's me."
15892,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,Mako? Where am I? Am I dead?
15893,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"No, you're on a train. We're gonna get you out of here."
15894,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Everyone out.
15895,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,I'm not going up there.
15896,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Jump!
15897,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,You all right?
15898,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You are definitely getting a raise, Buddy."
15899,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,You should be thanking Korra. We never would have found you with out her.
15900,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"I owe you my life, Avatar. If only there was some way to repay you. Oh, I know. How about I take you out for a night on the town?"
15901,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Really? You're asking me out right now?
15902,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"So ... I put you down for a ""maybe""?"
15903,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,How about a never?
15904,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,Not exactly what I imagined for our first day back together.
15905,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,But it was kind of like old times. Except for the getting on each other's nerves part.
15906,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Actually, that is like old times for me and Korra."
15907,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.
15908,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Asami,"It's all right. I guess after being apart for three years, there's bound to be a bit of an adjustment period."
15909,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Yeah, but it's great to have you back."
15910,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,There's no place else I'd rather be.
15911,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,You guys are the greatest friends a guy could have.
15912,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Korra,"So, what are we gonna do with him? It's too dangerous to take him back to the hotel."
15913,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,Whoo! You're telling me! I need a cushy safe house somewhere.
15914,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,I think I know just the place.
15915,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"Nice digs, Mako. You didn't tell me you came from money."
15916,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,I don't. This is Asami's place. She was nice enough to let my family stay here after they fled Ba Sing Se.
15917,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Yin,Mako! It's so wonderful to-- Are you ...
15918,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,"Grandma, this is Prince Wu. He needs to stay with you and the family for a little while."
15919,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"It's an honor, Grandma Mako."
15920,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Mako,She loves royalty.
15921,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Wu,"I think I'll fit right in here. Thanks for looking out for me, Mako. Now where's the nearest bathroom? I have been holding it all day!"
15922,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,"I know it might not mean much coming from a guy wearing this uniform, but I'd like to apologize for what Kuvira's put you through."
15923,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Baraz,I appreciate that.
15924,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Bolin,Guess this is where we part ways.
15925,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,It's been a blast!
15926,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Ahnah,We're heading north too. Why don't you come with us? It's the least we could do after you saved our necks.
15927,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Varrick,"On that hunk of junk? No thanks. I'm allergic to drowning. I mean, uh, we'd love a lift!"
15928,2,Reunion,Balance,4,107,Kuvira,Perfect. Harvest the vines until there's nothing left.
15929,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"You know, there's something about being kidnapped that makes a guy realize he needs to get his act together."
15930,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Yeah, I agree. Let's toughen you up."
15931,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"''Daaah'', I wasn't ready! Wu down!"
15932,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Yin,"What's going on? Mako, how dare you injure the prince! Would his royal highness like a cherry-berry lemonade?"
15933,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"And maybe some of those sticky dumplings, too?"
15934,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Look at you! You're so weak, ""Wu down"" is your catchphrase."
15935,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"I know, I'm a wimp. But it's not my fault, I was ''born'' that way! I'm not like you Mako, I wasn't raised by a pack of cops in the woods."
15936,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"You don't know anything about me, do you?"
15937,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"Yeah, I'm drawing a blank. Why is that? How do I not ''know'' stuff about you?"
15938,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Uhh ... you never asked?
15939,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"Well, I'm asking now! What's your favorite food? What's your favorite color? Is there a special lady in your life?"
15940,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Not since Korra and I broke up.
15941,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,What? ''You dated the Avatar''? Sit! You and I need to have a little gab session ''right now!'' How'd you guys first meet?
15942,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Bolin and I were playing for the Fire Ferrets.
15943,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Yes. Will you just let me tell the story?
15944,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Carry on.
15945,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,"Come on, I want you to meet my brother, Mako."
15946,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"Mako? Wow, I-I heard you play on the radio!"
15947,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Come on, Bolin, we're up."
15948,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"Whoa! That was the first time you met? Kind of rude there, buddy!"
15949,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"You know what else is rude? ''Interrupting''. Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender and a loyal friend. She helped me save Bolin when he was taken by the Equalists. After going through such a crazy experience, I felt like Korra and I had a powerful connection."
15950,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"So then you smooched her real good, eh?"
15951,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Not exactly.
15952,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Ahhhh!
15953,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami Sato,"Oh no! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you!"
15954,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Wait. That was the first thing you said to Asami? You ''really'' gotta work on your introductions.
15955,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Hey. When you got charm like mine, you don't need introductions."
15956,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Hanging out with Asami was awesome. But it made things with Korra complicated.
15957,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"So, I was thinking we should spend some time together. Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other."
15958,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"That's harsh, Mako."
15959,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,We need to talk.
15960,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me.
15961,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is, as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing."
15962,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Tu! Get out of here!
15963,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Yin,Naughty Mako! You take after your grandfather!
15964,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Guys, Grandma, everything wasn't so cut and dry. I wasn't ''dating'' Asami."
15965,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Tu,''Denial''.
15966,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,But my feelings for Korra became clear when Tarrlok captured her. It felt like a piece of me was gone.
15967,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,I was so worried. Are you all right?
15968,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,I'm fine. I'm glad you're here.
15969,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Hoo! I bet Asami wasn't too happy about ''that.''
15970,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,"I've noticed how you treat Korra, how you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?"
15971,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later?
15972,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,"Well, there might not be a relationship to worry about later."
15973,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,''Asami''!
15974,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Ouch!
15975,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Yep. Turns out, she was right. It was time to man up and call it quits."
15976,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Asami. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you."
15977,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,"I care about you, too."
15978,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Fine. But I hope you weren't as ambiguous with Korra as you were with Asami.
15979,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Trust me, I wasn't."
15980,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together and after that, I was finally able to tell her how I felt. Exactly how I felt."
15981,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"I love you, Korra."
15982,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"I love you, too."
15983,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Yin,Awww. And then you two lived happily ever after?
15984,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Ummmm ...
15985,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.
15986,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,Of course you take his side.
15987,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,I'm not taking his side.
15988,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on."
15989,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,There aren't any sides!
15990,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,How could you take his side?
15991,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,What's with you and sides?
15992,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"Well, excuse ''me'', officer! Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets! I'm just trying to save the world!"
15993,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!"
15994,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"So, what? Are you ... breaking up with me?"
15995,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Yeah ... I guess I am.
15996,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Now ''that's'' a breakup!
15997,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe. Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps. The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra. It was an intense night. Asami and I discovered the triads had double-crossed us. We barely got away, but by then, Asami's warehouse had been cleared out."
15998,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,My company ... it's over ... I give up.
15999,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Well ... I'm not giving up on ''you''.
16000,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"I know, I know, don't tell me ... I had no right kissing Asami."
16001,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"No, actually, I'm completely fine with that. You officially broke up with Korra and therefore, you're free to smooch whoever you wish."
16002,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,If only it had been that simple.
16003,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"Mako, I missed you so much!"
16004,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Korra ... hey, I-I missed you, too. So you're not still mad at me? We had that fight before you left, remember?"
16005,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,Not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?
16006,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Ahhhhh ... Hmmmm, no. No. It-it wasn't that bad."
16007,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! So you were back with Asami, but then Korra came back and thought you guys were still together and you didn't tell her you ''weren't''?"
16008,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Yin,Just like your grandfather.
16009,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Well, me and Asami were never ''officially'' back together."
16010,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Tu,"''Really''? That again? You know, it seems like you're so afraid to disappoint anyone that you end up disappointing everyone."
16011,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Truer words have never been spoken. High-five!
16012,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"Well, eventually, I did tell Korra. But by then, she already knew."
16013,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?
16014,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"I know I should have, but ... I didn't want to hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup, too."
16015,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,I think we both know that this ... us ... doesn't work.
16016,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,You're right.
16017,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,It's ... over. For real this time.
16018,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,"After Harmonic Convergence, the world changed. Team Avatar traveled around, searching for new airbenders. At first, it was awkward being around Korra and Asami."
16019,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,As you were. Ladies.
16020,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,But then I realized I had to figure out who I was without a lady in my life.
16021,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,I know what that's like.
16022,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"I mean, to need distance from women. Because I have so many, all over me, all the time."
16023,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Wow! That story is amazing and I ''really'' learned something!
16024,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,You did? Good.
16025,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"Yeah! I learned that I ''really'' didn't know anything about you! Crazy! Also, I realized that ladies are complicated. No offense, Grandma."
16026,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Yin,None taken.
16027,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,"I better just focus on being a better king. Okay, come at me. I can take it."
16028,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Wu,Aahhhhh! Wu down!
16029,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,I brought you some tea. I thought you might be cold out here.
16030,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,You're so sweet. Thanks.
16031,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,Are you okay? You seem out of sorts.
16032,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,Sorry. I've just been thinking about something Toph said. She told me that the world doesn't need me and it's basically ''pointless'' to try and stop Kuvira.
16033,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,That's ridiculous.
16034,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"At the time, I thought so, too. I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self. But I'm beginning to think she had a point."
16035,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,"No, she ''doesn't''. The world ''does'' need you. You're the Avatar."
16036,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"But no matter what I do, the world seems to always be out of balance! Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar. I thought I was ''really'' gonna change things. I was ''so'' naive. The first time I saw Amon take someone's bending away, I was terrified."
16037,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Amon,Your firebending is gone! ''Forever''.
16038,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,Then my worst nightmare came true.
16039,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Mako,Korra!
16040,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,No!
16041,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Amon,I told you I would destroy you.
16042,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,"Korra, you're forgetting about all the good that happened after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was. The Equalist Movement lost its leader ''and'' its power. Free elections were held in the United Republic and nonbenders ''finally'' had a voice. People had hope again and it was all because of you."
16043,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Unalaq,"If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal ''now''."
16044,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the Spirit and human worlds into chaos. It was my fault he fused with Vaatu and became a Dark Avatar. And I was helpless to stop him from destroying Raava and cutting off my connection to my past lives. With Raava gone, Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever."
16045,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,"But you became more powerful, too. I mean ... you turned into a giant spirit."
16046,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,Yeah ... that ''was'' pretty awesome.
16047,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing. You brought back the airbenders ''and ''caused a positive shift in the world.
16048,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"Yes, ''but'' Zaheer got airbending too and nearly killed me. If it weren't for Zaheer, the Earth Queen would still be alive. There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom and Kuvira wouldn't be in power. Things are more out of balance than ''ever'' now. Nothing's changed!"
16049,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Tenzin,"You're right, Korra."
16050,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,I am?
16051,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Asami,She is?
16052,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Tenzin,"It's true, there will always be new conflicts and enemies to face. But the important thing is to ''learn'' from your enemies and better yourself over time, which you have. You've changed so much since you first arrived on Air Temple Island. When you first came here, you were hot-headed and a bit selfish. But you've matured into a thoughtful young woman who puts the needs of others before herself. The new Air Nation is a testament to that. You sacrificed everything to save them. You're an inspiration to the world."
16053,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,"Thank you both. I know this Kuvira problem is only going to get worse. But no matter what happens, no matter how ''crazy'' things get, I'll ''always'' try to restore balance."
16054,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Baraz,"And that's when I made a solemn vow never to eat bark-onion soup again. Been six years, four months and fourteen days ... Urgh! I can still taste it."
16055,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,Not me! I've spent the last few hours tuning out all these incredibly boring stories ...
16056,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"Both. It's your true story, but we'll capitalize on the audience of the Nuktuk franchise. Duh!"
16057,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"Nyahbabababab! You're emphasizing the wrong story beads. Let me tell it. The story of Bolin begins in an exotic port of call. A wise sage, the richest merchant in the world, and a handsome devil all sit on a single pillow in the living room of a luxury yacht! How do they all fit on one pillow?"
16058,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,Ooh! Giant pillow!
16059,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"Wrong! They're all the same man! ''Me!'' I try to teach a swami the power of levitation, but he's too stupid to understand it, so I kick him out. ""Upon whom can I bestow my awesome knowledge?"" I ask myself. Then, in walks Nuktuk, with a twinkle in his eye, a gorgeous dame on his arm, and a song on his lips. He bursts into a rapturous melody! ""''Where can I find my teacher?''"""
16060,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,"Oh, come on! I wasn't singing, ''you'' were not levitating, and Asami is just a friend, thank you very much. If you want to tell my true story, you should start from when I met Korra. She came to the bending arena, one fateful night ..."
16061,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,This place is even more amazing than I imagined!
16062,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,"Name's Bolin, by the way."
16063,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Korra,Korra.
16064,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,There wasn't any singing!
16065,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"You're on-screen talent, kid. Leave the storytelling to the masters. So, the trouble begins when the Avatar is trapped in the Spirit World. The world's most evil villains realize that with Korra out of the way, the time is right to try to take out Bolin. So, the worst of the worst team up. They're led by ... ''Zaheer'', leader of the Red Lotus and master of the skies, a flying chaotic chaos machine! He's joined by ... ''Vaatu'', the ultimate force of pure spirit evil in the universe. The biggest, meanest, scariest ''kite'' that ever flew!"
16066,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,Wait! Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu. How would that even happen?
16067,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,How do you think?
16068,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Vaatu,Hello?
16069,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Zaheer,Hey. It's Zaheer.
16070,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Vaatu,"Oh. Hey, Zaheer."
16071,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Zaheer,Glad I caught you at home.
16072,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Vaatu,Uh-huh. Very funny. Like I can leave this stupid tree.
16073,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,Amon! The reanimated zombie body of the bloodbending leader of the Equalists!
16074,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Unalaq,"Not include ''who'', Amon?"
16075,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"The evil ''Unalaq''. The diabolical but incredibly boring and unpopular sorcerer from the north, who's listening in on the other line!"
16076,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Unalaq,"I've spent my life trying to defeat Nuktuk, I mean, ''Bolin'', and I know just where to find him: With all the beautiful ladies!"
16077,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"Yes, Bolin had a reputation as the world's greatest ladies' man."
16078,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,"Oooh, ''now'' the story's getting interesting."
16079,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"After leaving the beautiful but emotionally unstable Water Tribe princess at the altar, he met a fetching ''airbender'', the heir to a vast Earth Kingdom fortune!"
16080,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,"''Opal'', so smart and caring, so pretty to smell, and she'll probably never talk to me again because I'm so stupid! ''Stupid''! So, so, so stupid."
16081,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Amon,"Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him."
16082,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Unalaq,Hello? Anyone there? ''Guys''!
16083,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"And with danger closing in, Opal realizes how much she loves Bolin and forgives him for whatever stuff he was talking about earlier, which will probably not be in the final cut of the mover anyway."
16084,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,All refugees,Awww!
16085,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"And she ''kisses'' Bolin, magically passing on the airbender power of flight!"
16086,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,"Okay, that part seems a little unbelievable."
16087,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Bolin,"Wait! You ''like'' that? It didn't make any sense! What about Zombie Amon? What happened to him, ''huh''? And-and-and-and ''stars'' are magic fairy dust? Are you guys crazy? Are you crazy?"
16088,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Baraz,It's just a mover. Don't over-think it. It's like a ride.
16089,2,Remembrances,Balance,4,108,Varrick,"Never let the truth get in the way of a good story, kid!"
16090,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Shiro Shinobi,"Korra is safely back in Republic City, but Bolin and Varrick are still on the lam! Weeks ago, Korra removed the remaining poison from her body, but the memory of Zaheer's attack still torments her and, after being defeated by Kuvira, she questions if she will ever fully recover. Meanwhile, Kuvira has been secretly harvesting spirit vines from the swamp, but how close is she to completing her spirit energy weapon?"
16091,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,"Everyone! Mom! Can we stay together, please? The tour is about to begin."
16092,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu's mother,"That's my boy. Ryu, he used to live in the basement, but then he got airbending, and he's been doing important Air Nation stuff all over the world. His father and I are here, visiting him and, we're just having the best time in the big city, we're so proud. Right, honey?"
16093,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu's father,"Well, at least he has a job now."
16094,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,"Mom, Dad, I'm trying to work!"
16095,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,"Fun fact, everyone. All these vines were created by UnaVaatu when he battled giant spirit Korra for the fate of the world."
16096,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,No.
16097,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,No! Can I just get through my cards?
16098,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu's mother,"Aw, honey, don't get flustered."
16099,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,I'm not!
16100,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,Uh ... I don't see anything about that in the cards.
16101,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,No! Why would you do that?
16102,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,Everyone back!
16103,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu's mother,This tour is exciting!
16104,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu's mother,Isn't Ryu the best airbender ever?
16105,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,Everything okay?
16106,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,No. Kuvira has my family and no one seems to care but me.
16107,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"We ''all'' care. Don't worry, we'll get them back safely."
16108,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Jinora,"Guys, there you are! I just felt a weird surge of spiritual energy coming from the Spirit Wilds. Something's ''wrong''."
16109,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,Are you sure you felt a disturbance? Maybe you just had some bad food for breakfast.
16110,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Jinora,"I'm telling you, I ''felt'' it. Maybe something happened to Ryu's tour group. We should've run into them by now."
16111,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"Yeah, but it's Ryu. They might be at the mall, for all we know."
16112,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Jinora,"Korra, can't you feel how strange the energy is?"
16113,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,No ... but maybe I can get a reading.
16114,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,"Korra, what is it? Are you okay?"
16115,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"It was Kuvira. I saw her taking vines from the swamp. It must be affecting our Spirit Wilds. I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora."
16116,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Jinora,Why is she taking vines?
16117,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"Whatever the reason, I'm sure it's not good."
16118,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,We have to tell Raiko. ''This'' might help him convince the other leaders to finally take her down!
16119,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Jinora,I'll keep looking for Ryu and the others.
16120,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,I say we deal with this Kuvira situation immediately.
16121,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,"Look, I think we ''all'' know what must be done. We take the fight ''to her''."
16122,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,"I don't believe attacking is the right move, since she hasn't done anything aggressive toward the United Republic."
16123,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Lin,Not yet. But Kuvira can't be trusted. She told us that she was going to turn over power and she didn't. ''I'm'' with Raiko. I say we go on the offensive and start by retaking Zaofu.
16124,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"You invited ''him'', but not me?"
16125,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,"Please, Korra, it's not personal. We just thought, perhaps we called you back into action a little too soon."
16126,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"Again, ''him'', not me?!"
16127,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,"Korra, we're in the middle of a meeting and we can't have people just barge in whenever they want!"
16128,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"Guys! Oh, perfect! You're all here."
16129,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal and Mako,Bolin?
16130,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,"What are you doing here?! Guards, remove these traitors!"
16131,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Varrick,"Okay, I guess we should've opened with that line."
16132,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"Listen to me. Kuvira's making this thing that goes I don't know how it works, but it has this"
16133,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,And let me guess: it has something to do with spirit vines.
16134,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Varrick,Yes! How did you know?
16135,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from the swamp.
16136,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Varrick,"If she figures out how to harness their power, we are ''all'' doomed."
16137,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,She might use the weapon to attack Republic City. The only way to protect ourselves is with a preemptive strike.
16138,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,My airbenders ''won't'' be part of an unprovoked attack!
16139,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Izumi,Neither will the Fire Nation.
16140,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,"But, Fire Lord Izumi, Kuvira is a threat to the world! She has to be stopped!"
16141,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Izumi,"The Fire Nation has spent too much of its history fighting nonsense wars. And I refuse to drag ''my'' nation into another one unless there is no other choice. ''If'' you attack Kuvira, you'll do it ''without'' my army."
16142,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,Fine. I'll hold off any plans of attack. We'll go on the defensive and fortify security on the borders.
16143,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Izumi,"In that, you'll have my help."
16144,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,"I'm glad you're okay, but it's a little late for ""sorry""."
16145,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"I know, I know. I didn't listen to you, and I sided with Kuvira, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom, and topple your home, and get your mom captured, and your brothers, and your dad ... Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that. But I'm gonna make it up to you."
16146,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Lin,"Pardon me, lovebirds, but I need a word with Opal. ''Privately''. I'm sorry, kid, but Raiko couldn't convince the other leaders to attack Kuvira."
16147,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,So our family ...
16148,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Lin,Looks like we're going to have to save them ourselves.
16149,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,Don't you think some other people would agree to go with us?
16150,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Lin,"''This'' is an unsanctioned and dangerous mission into enemy territory. We can't ask other people to risk their necks for our family. If we want to break them out, we'll have to do it alone."
16151,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,"Bolin, I'm so glad you're back. I was worried about you."
16152,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,We all were.
16153,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"Thanks, guys. Mako, I'm ''so'' sorry about the way we left things. I'm such an idiot. You tried to warn me about Kuvira and I ran off anyway, like an idiot. You were right and I'm ''just'' an ''idiot''. I hope ... that ... I'll be able to earn your trust again."
16154,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"If ''anyone'' has lost people's trust, it's me. Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt, no one even wants me around."
16155,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"Aww, I love you guys. And I really wanna hug again."
16156,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Jinora,Korra! The vines! They're taking me! Help!
16157,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Lin,Get everyone out of here. Put up a perimeter. Cancel all tours. Somebody get a hold of Tenzin.
16158,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,We gotta get in there and find Jinora.
16159,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Lin,I don't think ''anyone'' should be going in there right now.
16160,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be, but I can ''do'' this."
16161,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Lin,Be careful.
16162,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,Jinora!
16163,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,"Hello, anyone? Wait. Do you hear that?"
16164,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,Come on!
16165,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,"Korra, look. What are those?"
16166,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,It's Jinora and the rest of them. Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World.
16167,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,Let's get them out.
16168,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,Wait ... this isn't the Spirit World.
16169,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,Zaheer! No!
16170,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,You can't fight me ''and'' the poison!
16171,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,No ... I got it out!
16172,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,You'll never get it out!
16173,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,Korra! What's wrong?
16174,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,It's Zaheer.
16175,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,What are you talking about?
16176,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,He's been haunting me ever since I fought him. I can't get any peace. It's like he's blocking me from meditating into the Spirit World.
16177,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,I'm here for you. What do you need?
16178,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I want to face Zaheer.
16179,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,"Korra, he's too dangerous. Even when he's locked up, he can't be trusted."
16180,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I ''need'' to if I wanna save Jinora and the others. There's no other way.
16181,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,There ''is'' another way. I'm calling your father. He can lead an expedition into the Spirit World from the Southern portal.
16182,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"You've lost faith in me, too, haven't you? No one thinks I'm capable of anything anymore."
16183,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,It's not that at all.
16184,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I know I can do this.
16185,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,"I'm just so worried for Jinora. I can't imagine if something happened to you, too."
16186,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"Tenzin, please. I'll be okay."
16187,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,Zaheer's imprisoned deep in the mountains outside the city. I'll call Raiko and get the clearance.
16188,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,Thank you.
16189,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,"Hello, Pabu. Well, it's good to see you, too. What do you got there?"
16190,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"Opal, you made it!"
16191,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,What's this?
16192,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"A picnic, just for the two of us! Well, the three of us. Sorry, Pabs."
16193,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,"So, this note Pabu brought me saying you ''broke'' both of your legs was just a ruse?"
16194,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,"Oh. Steam buns. My favorite. This will ''totally'' make me forget that you worked for Kuvira, the person who captured my family and is probably torturing them right now. So yeah, let's just sit down and have a ''great'' picnic because we're ''so'' in love! I'm sorry you had to see that, Pabu."
16195,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,Thank you both for coming.
16196,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Varrick,It's nice to be welcomed back with open arms.
16197,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,"Actually, I brought you here out of necessity. It's no secret I never liked you. Especially after you tried to have me kidnapped."
16198,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Varrick,Allegedly.
16199,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Asami,"Right. Everything you do is ""allegedly"". Like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center!"
16200,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Varrick,I own that building! A man has a right to blow up his own property!
16201,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raiko,"Right now, I need you to put aside your differences. If Kuvira really is creating a super weapon, we're going to need the two brightest minds in the city working ''together'' to stop it."
16202,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Varrick,"What do you say, Asami? Partners again?"
16203,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Asami,Fine. I'll help. But don't even think about double-crossing me again.
16204,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,Are you sure you're ready for this?
16205,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"Yes. I think if I see Zaheer chained up, I'll finally realize that he's not a threat anymore."
16206,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,White Lotus guard,Approach the wall.
16207,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,No. I need to do this alone.
16208,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,I figured you would show up sooner or later. So ... you must ''really'' be in trouble if you came all the way down here to see me.
16209,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I came here to look you in the eye and tell you that you have ''no'' power over me. I will no longer be scared of you.
16210,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,I guess it didn't work. You still seem scared.
16211,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,This was a mistake.
16212,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,I know why you're here.
16213,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,You don't know anything about me!
16214,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,You can't go into the Spirit World. I spend most of my time in the Spirit World and it's well known that the Avatar's spirit hasn't been there for a few years.
16215,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,''You'' can meditate into the Spirit World from ''here''? Doesn't feel very spiritually charged.
16216,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,This is your problem. Republic City is flowing with spiritual energy and you can't even tap into it.
16217,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"No, my problem is you! You poisoned me! You've ''ruined'' me! People used to think I was unstoppable, but now they don't think I'm capable of anything!"
16218,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,"Blaming me is a crutch to make you feel better, but it's not helping you recover."
16219,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I thought seeing you face-to-face would put an end to all of this. But maybe it's time I realize I'll never be the same.
16220,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,"Neither of us are the same as before. I learned to fly, but now I'm bound in chains. You have all the power in the world and the freedom to use it, but you choose to hold yourself down."
16221,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"I'm not holding myself down, but my powers have limits!"
16222,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"Whatever. ''Before'', you were always talking about chaos and freedom. Then you took out the Earth Queen and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen. ''Thanks'' for that!"
16223,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,"I've heard rumors about her, but I didn't know she achieved so much power. She needs to be stopped."
16224,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"Well, I ''can't'' stop her unless I get over this block."
16225,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,I think I can help. Let me lead you into the Spirit World.
16226,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,No way. I can't trust you.
16227,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,"Maybe not. But if you had any other options, you wouldn't be here now, would you? We may have been enemies once, but for now, our interests align."
16228,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I've come this far. What have I got to lose?
16229,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,Focus on the sound of my voice and clear your mind. Let it play out.
16230,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I can't!
16231,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,You can. Accept what happened to you. Don't fear what might have been.
16232,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I have no control!
16233,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,Don't be afraid. Hold on!
16234,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I made it ... and ''you'' led me here. Do you know where Jinora and the others are?
16235,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Zaheer,"No, but you do."
16236,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,"Raava, I missed you. Where have you been?"
16237,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raava,I have ''always'' been inside of you.
16238,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,Can you help me find Jinora? How do I release their spirits?
16239,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raava,You must bend the energy within.
16240,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,But I'm ''powerless'' in the Spirit World.
16241,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Raava,"No. You're most powerful here. In the Spirit World, you're connected to ''all'' the spiritual energy."
16242,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Ryu,Ugh ... I feel all spirity.
16243,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Jinora,Dad!
16244,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Tenzin,I'm so glad you're safe. What happened? How did you get out?
16245,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Jinora,Korra saved us.
16246,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,So ... how are you doing?
16247,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,I feel ... ''whole'' again. I feel good.
16248,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Mako,Do you think you're finally able to forget about what Zaheer did to you?
16249,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Korra,No. But I ''am'' finally able to accept what happened and I think that's gonna make me stronger.
16250,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,Where are you going?
16251,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,We've got some family business to take care of.
16252,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"All right, listen. Before you go, I just want to tell you that I understand how you feel. I know there is nothing I could do or no big gesture that could make up for all my mistakes, ''but'' that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying to win you back because ... I love you."
16253,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,Thanks for saying all of that. You know ... there ''is'' one thing you could do to win me back.
16254,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,"What is it? Yes, I'll do anything!"
16255,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,Come on a secret mission with us.
16256,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Bolin,Where to?
16257,2,Beyond the Wilds,Balance,4,109,Opal,Zaofu. We're going to rescue my family.
16258,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Shiro Shinobi,"After Kuvira harvested spirit vines from the swamp, the vines in Republic City reacted by abducting people. Korra saved everyone, but all is not well. Varrick and Bolin returned to warn everyone about Kuvira's spirit vine super weapon. Now Raiko wants to mount a defense against the Earth Empire! Meanwhile, Bolin, Opal, and Lin are on a mission to rescue Su Beifong and her family, who are being held captive by Kuvira!"
16259,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"All right, let's do this! Saving the Beifongs and saving our love, because I vow to repair the rift that has grown betwixt us and make us whole again!"
16260,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin Beifong,You. Zip it. Now. I had enough of your babble on the way in.
16261,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"Yes, ma'am."
16262,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,Kuvira tore down all the domes. Why would she do that?
16263,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,She's got a whole battalion of troops stationed there. There's no way we'll be able to spot anything useful from here. We'll have to go in for a closer look.
16264,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,Don't bother. All the prisoners have been moved.
16265,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Uh ... hey, Chief."
16266,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"Hey, Chief."
16267,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,Grandma Toph!
16268,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,You were only up to my waist the last time we were together.
16269,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"Oh, man! Ohh, I can't. This can't be happening!"
16270,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,What?! Do you have to pee or something?
16271,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"No ... well, now, maybe. You're my hero! My name is Bolin. I'm dating your granddaughter, I mean, kind of. I may have screwed that up, but that's why I'm here and you're my hero! Oh, I said that. Can I have a hug too?"
16272,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,What's up with him?
16273,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"He's an actor. So, you already checked the city for Su? How did you know she was captured?"
16274,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,I've been living in the swamp and keeping watch on Zaofu through the vines.
16275,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"Sure, okay, makes sense."
16276,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"By the time I got here, they were gone. I snooped around town and heard that they were taken away to some nearby prison camp."
16277,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,Where would that be?
16278,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,There's a factory and reeducation facility not too far away.
16279,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,How do you know that?
16280,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,Bolin used to work for Kuvira.
16281,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,How did you end up dating the kind of dipstick who works for Kuvira?
16282,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"""Used to""!"
16283,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"It's not his silver tongue, I can tell you that."
16284,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,Please tell me this attitude isn't hereditary.
16285,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,"Grandma, this is Juicy."
16286,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"And I thought Appa was smelly. Why would you choose this leaky, nasty thing?"
16287,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,"You don't choose your bison. He chooses you. And once he chooses you, you can't change. Believe me, I checked."
16288,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Raiko,The borders are secure and troops are guarding the rail lines into the city. So what have you two geniuses come up with to fend off Kuvira?
16289,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Raiko,Where does the spirit ray come out?
16290,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Varrick,It doesn't have a spirit ray. I'm telling you what I told Kuvira: That technology should not be used!
16291,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Raiko,It's already being used by Kuvira! I need spirit vine weapons and I need them now!
16292,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Korra,''No.'' It was Kuvira's harvesting of the vines in the swamp that caused the Republic City vines to go crazy and grab all those people.
16293,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Raiko,You're supposed to be the bridge between the two worlds. Why can't you harvest the vines?
16294,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Korra,"I won't do that. But maybe since the spirits love Republic City so much, I can convince them to help us defend it somehow."
16295,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Raiko,Hm.
16296,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Wu,"Okay, maybe while the weapon geniuses and the spirit bridge are getting ready for battle, we should be evacuating the ordinary citizens so that if Kuvira attacks, they won't be hurt."
16297,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Raiko,"That's ... actually a good idea. Prince Wu, you work with the police to coordinate getting people out of the city. Now everyone get to it. I want daily updates."
16298,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Mako,Nice job in there. I'm proud of you. You're starting to act like the kind of king I'd like to work for.
16299,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Wu,"Thanks. And if Korra buys this ""man of the people"" thing, I still might get to date her."
16300,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Mako,You always have to ruin it.
16301,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Wu,"What? Come on! Why do you think guys do anything great? To pick up girls. Every work of art, every song, every city evacuation, all for the ladies."
16302,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,There's a problem with the condenser. It's backing up!
16303,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,I can't. The override isn't working. Everyone needs to evacuate. This thing is going to blow!
16304,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,"Come on, Baatar! It's too late!"
16305,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,So how long as it been since you two have seen each other?
16306,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,Little while now. Couple of years.
16307,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,Try twenty.
16308,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"Ah, time flies when you get to be my age. I'm surprised you came to save Su. I thought you guys didn't get along."
16309,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,Su and I finally worked out our old grievances.
16310,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"Good, glad we can put all that behind us."
16311,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Right. ""We""."
16312,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"Okay, there's the factory."
16313,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"Whoa, that's one big ... thing."
16314,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"I think I know where they are. Feel that cavern a few stories down? It seems empty, but it's guarded by an awful lot of mech."
16315,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Right. Why would you need soldiers guarding an empty cavern? They must have them in some kind of suspended prison, so they can't use their earthbending."
16316,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,Someone's coming. Hide!
16317,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,I just wanted to check in to make sure everything was on track. It looks wonderful.
16318,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,"You've been working on this the entire time, Zhu Li. What do you think the problem is?"
16319,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,It's a very complex machine. There are bound to be some bugs to work out.
16320,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,"But you're doing everything you can to fix those, correct?"
16321,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,"Of course, your eminence."
16322,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,She's lying.
16323,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,Tell the troops and the factory workers to attend tomorrow's demonstration. I want them all to witness this incredible new weapon in action.
16324,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,We should be thinking of a way to take out Kuvira while we have the chance.
16325,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"Or at least destroy the cannon. If she takes that to Republic City, it could obliterate everything."
16326,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,I didn't come to fight with Kuvira or destroy a cannon. I'm here to save my family. It will take everything we have just to get out alive.
16327,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"Hmm. Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then. That's our best chance to sneak in and free Su without being spotted."
16328,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,"Good thinking, Bolin."
16329,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,Thanks. I kind of have a headache now.
16330,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Korra,"Excuse me, spirit? Can I talk to ... and you're gone. Just like all the other spirits. They're abandoning the city."
16331,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"So let me ask you about metalbending. Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it."
16332,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,I used to have an academy to train metalbending. Even blockheads like you can figure it out with the right instruction.
16333,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Yeah, you're a real sensitive instructor."
16334,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,I did learn how to lavabend.
16335,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,Really? It's a very rare ability. Maybe you do have some talent.
16336,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,I can't believe ... you think I'm talented? That means so much to me coming from my hero.
16337,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Yeah, she's real encouraging."
16338,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"Hey! I'm blind, not deaf."
16339,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,So here's something I've always been curious about: Who's Lin's dad?
16340,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"He was a guy named Kanto. Nice man, but it didn't really work out between us."
16341,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,And ... okay.
16342,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"Lin, I can feel your enraged breathing from here. Just say what you have to say and let's get it over with."
16343,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Just get it over with? Yeah, let's not linger on the fact that I grew up without a dad. No need to get all touchy-feely about it. Just one of those things, right?"
16344,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"Hey, I forgave you for all your garbage a long time ago and Su and I worked things out. You're the only one who wants to hold on to this family drama nonsense for the rest of your life."
16345,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Forgave me for what?! And not knowing my dad is nonsense to you? It was pretty important to me. And until now, you would never even discuss it. You know, after Su and I patched things up, I thought, ""maybe I should try to reach out to mom."" But now that we're together again, I remember why we stopped talking. You make me furious and you don't even know why. And when I tell you, you don't care. Once we save Su, you and I are finished."
16346,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"If that's your decision and it makes you happy, then fine."
16347,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,The test is about to start. They're going to blow up that empty town we flew over yesterday. You're clear to go.
16348,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,Copy that. We're clear to go.
16349,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,The guards are on the other side of that door. We'll have to be quiet.
16350,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Shoot me over to the cage and I can swing them back on my cable. Bolin, you'll have to catch them since mom won't be able to see them. Ready?"
16351,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,We'll get you out one at a time. Come on.
16352,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,I got you!
16353,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,"Congratulations on all of your hard work. This weapon is proof that the Earth Empire is the strongest nation in the world. And believe me, this is only the beginning! Fire the weapon."
16354,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,What's wrong?
16355,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,And this could cause the entire weapon to fail?
16356,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,What do you know about this?
16357,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,Nothing.
16358,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,You swore your loyalty to me and I gave you a chance at greatness. This is how you repay me?!
16359,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,You're a monster. I regret nothing.
16360,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,Chain her up in the target town. She can see how the weapon works up close and personal.
16361,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,"Oh, no."
16362,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Suyin,"Sweetie, it'll be fine. Lin won't drop you and Bolin will catch you."
16363,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Baatar,"No, no. Just go. Just leave me. I'll stay here."
16364,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,The prison. Get there now!
16365,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Kuvira,I didn't come all this way to stop now. Fire when ready. I want to see that town destroyed.
16366,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,We got 'em. We're coming out.
16367,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,Mom! Dad! Thank you.
16368,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,Let's move.
16369,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,Kuvira caught Zhu Li and threw her in the town.
16370,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"What? No, I have to go save her."
16371,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"You can't go in there, kid. It's suicide. Kuvira's onto us."
16372,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"We've been through too much together. I can't leave her. Toph, you said Zhu Li was lying about fixing the cannon. She must have been trying to stop it."
16373,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"For all you know, she could just have been covering her butt because she made a mistake."
16374,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"No, Zhu Li doesn't make mistakes. You guys leave. If we make it out, we'll make it to the city somehow."
16375,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,"Bolin, no! You guys get out of here. I have to go with Bolin."
16376,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Suyin,Could be our best chance to stop Kuvira.
16377,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,Maybe take out that weapon.
16378,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Wing,We can't let Opal be the coolest!
16379,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"If you all want to get yourselves captured again or worse, that's your business. I'm through."
16380,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Suyin,Watch out for Baatar Sr. and Huan.
16381,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Baatar,"So how have you been, mother?"
16382,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,I told you never to call me that.
16383,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Korra,"Spirits, this is the Avatar. Please listen to me. Since I opened the portals, spirits and humans have lived happily together in Republic City. It's all I could have hoped for. I know you felt the effects of Kuvira cutting down spirit vines. But now isn't the time for you to flee the city. It's time for you to help me save it from Kuvira, who was perverting spirit power to use as a weapon against other humans."
16384,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Dragon eel spirit,We don't get involved with human wars.
16385,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Korra,Spirits worked with Unalaq.
16386,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Dragon eel spirit,He was misusing Vaatu's power during Harmonic Convergence to force spirits to fight you. Is that what you want?
16387,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Korra,"No, but as the Avatar, I'm hoping that you will come to my aid to save the new world we all share."
16388,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Dragon eel spirit,What you want is exactly what Kuvira wants: to use spirits as a weapon in a human war. The answer is no.
16389,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Korra,"Wait! Please, listen. If spirits and humans are gonna live together, we have to work with each other!"
16390,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,Whoa.
16391,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,You give metalbenders a bad name!
16392,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Suyin,"Thanks for coming to save us, Mom."
16393,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,"Yeah, thanks, Chief. I'm sorry for what I said last night. I was just ... you know."
16394,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"Look, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids. Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway. If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me."
16395,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Lin,Me too.
16396,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,"You know, I never had any family except for my brother until a few years ago, and reuniting with them made me realize how special it is.''"
16397,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"Argh, enough! Enjoy the ride back to the city with the gum flapper here."
16398,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,"Aren't you coming back to Republic City with us, Grandma?"
16399,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Toph,"No, my fighting days are over. Don't tell Korra, but my back is killing me now. This is why you didn't see Katara messing with that civil war nonsense. At some point, you gotta leave it to the kids."
16400,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,I want to thank you for coming back to save me. And don't be too hard on Bolin for working with Kuvira. His heart was in the right place.
16401,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Opal,I think Bolin has worked his way out of the polar bear doghouse.
16402,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Bolin,Yes!
16403,2,Operation Beifong,Balance,4,110,Zhu Li,We should get going. I'm afraid I have bad news to deliver to Republic City. Kuvira is going to attack in two weeks.
16404,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Shiro Shinobi,"Bolin, Opal, and Lin rescued the Beifongs and Zhu Li from Kuvira. Now they are racing to Republic City to alert everyone about the Earth Empire's imminent attack. Meanwhile, Korra and Team Avatar have been preparing for just such an event. Prince Wu is leading an evacuation effort, while Asami and Varrick are creating flying mecha suits. But with Kuvira planning to strike in only two weeks, will they be ready in time?"
16405,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,"Today, we stand on the precipice of history. For the past three years, we've fought side by side to unite the Earth Empire and we've proven that no one can stand in our way, not even the Avatar. But our mission is not yet complete."
16406,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,"There is a grave injustice that must be corrected. As you all know, after the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang, along with Fire Lord Zuko, stole Earth Empire land and formed the United Republic. This land belongs to the people of the Earth Empire and it's time to take it back! Republic City will be ours!"
16407,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Soldiers,''All hail the Great Uniter!''
16408,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,Are you ready to show the world what a true superpower looks like?
16409,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,"I never could have done this without your help. After we claim victory, we can finally get married and rule our empire together."
16410,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,How's the evacuation coming?
16411,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Wu,Could be better. At this point we've evacuated almost ... eighteen families.
16412,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Only ''eighteen''? There are ''millions'' of people in this city!
16413,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Wu,I said it could be better.
16414,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mako,"The problem is, it's a voluntary evacuation and there aren't very many volunteers. They just don't feel like they're in any immediate danger."
16415,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"Guys! Good, you're all here!"
16416,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Su ... what are you ... you're okay! I'm so sorry about Zaofu. How did you escape?
16417,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"Opal, Beifong, and I rescued everyone. But we had a run in with Kuvira. We saw her super spirit weapon up close. Like, ''really'' close. ''Way'' too close."
16418,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,Is she going to use it against Republic City?
16419,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Zhu Li,Yes. I found out she's going to attack in two weeks.
16420,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"Ooh! And Zhu Li's on our side now. Actually, she never really switched sides and I'm just gonna let her explain the whole thing. Zhu Li?"
16421,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Zhu Li,"I pretended to be loyal to Kuvira so I could sabotage her weapon. It didn't work, but I did overhear her plans to attack."
16422,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,I knew she wouldn't stop at Zaofu.
16423,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Lin,"My guess is, she's coming by rail. It's the only way she can transport that weapon."
16424,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Then we'll cut the rail lines.
16425,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,I agree. But let's get as many citizens evacuated before we do. Put out the announcement. The evacuation is now ''mandatory''.
16426,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mako,We're on it.
16427,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Don't worry Mr. President. I won't let Kuvira take our city.
16428,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Varrick,Weld hotter! Tighten tighter! The president said we only have two weeks to get these hummingbirds ''humming''!
16429,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"Varrick! Good, you're here. Can I talk to you for a minute?"
16430,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Varrick,What is it? I'm busy inspiring my workers.
16431,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"Well, I went to Zaofu and saved Su and her family ... and guess who else we found? Ha!"
16432,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Varrick,Zhu Li.
16433,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"Now, isn't there something you wanted to say to her? Hmm?"
16434,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Varrick,Don't be so hard on yourself. Apology accepted! Now be a good assistant and man the assembly line!
16435,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Zhu Li,"No! I am ''not'' your assistant anymore. If you want me around, you need to start treating me like an ''equal''!"
16436,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Radio operator,We're patched into the emergency broadcast line. You're going out to every radio in the city.
16437,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mako,"Attention citizens of Republic City. This is not a test. An attack on our city is imminent. President Raiko has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all citizens. Please find your evacuation handbooks and turn to subsection one-dash-two-six. There you will find initial instructions for your area. For example, if you live in northwest vector one, report to your primary meeting location, which would be at the eastern entrance of the Southern Water Tribe library. There, you would choose a leader as specified in section one-dash-two-eight."
16438,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Radio operator,"Uh, Chief, we're getting confused calls from ''all'' over the city. I think Mako's starting a panic."
16439,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mako,What's confusing? I'm giving very specific instructions.
16440,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Lin,"Good job, kid. You might not make such a bad king after all."
16441,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,Rohan's with the Acolytes. They have the boat ready to leave. Why aren't you all packed yet?
16442,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Pema,The kids and I have been talking and we decided we want to stay. This is ''our'' city and it's going to need ''all'' the help it can get.
16443,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Meelo,Yeah! Only a coward flees his fate.
16444,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Meelo,Kuvira's gonna ''rue'' the day she messed with Meelo.
16445,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,I still don't like having to abandon my office in the city.
16446,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Lin,Air Temple Island is the ideal location for your base of operations and you'll be safe here.
16447,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,There's something we need to discuss with you.
16448,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,What is it?
16449,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,The four of us have been talking and ... we wanna take out Kuvira's spirit weapon before it gets ''too'' close to the city.
16450,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,That sounds like a risk we don't need to take. The evacuation is on schedule and General Iroh is getting his army in place.
16451,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,"I know Iroh can go toe-to-toe with Kuvira's army, but that weapon ..."
16452,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,It's too powerful! It can destroy the city.
16453,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mako,We ''can't'' let it get to our doorstep.
16454,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,We'll sneak behind enemy lines and disable the weapon.
16455,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Asami,"If it works, it'll even the playing field."
16456,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,But if you get caught ...
16457,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,It's worth the risk.
16458,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,We'll head out tonight.
16459,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Sentry,There's something out there!
16460,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,Guys! I see something. Down there!
16461,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Kuvira. She's already crossed into United Republic territory. She's a week early.
16462,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mako,This doesn't make sense. There aren't any train tracks this way. How are they transporting that super weapon of theirs?
16463,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Asami,Apparently on a giant mecha suit!
16464,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mako,Did you know Kuvira was building that thing?
16465,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"Oh, did I forget to mention it? No, of course I didn't know!"
16466,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mecha operator,There's a flying bison up ahead.
16467,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,The Avatar.
16468,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"I know what happens next! We gotta get out of here, now! Now!"
16469,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,Korra? Are you all right? Why are you back so soon?
16470,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,It's Kuvira. Our intel was wrong. She must have known Zhu Li had the information.
16471,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,What are you trying to say?
16472,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Kuvira's army is only a few hours away.
16473,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,"No, they can't be! We're not ready."
16474,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,And that spirit weapon of hers is attached to a giant mecha suit. It's over twenty-five stories tall!
16475,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,Get General Iroh on the line and tell him that the attack is happening today. We need to lock down the city.
16476,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,"Pema! Find Wu and get the remaining citizens to safety, immediately. We can't have innocent lives in jeopardy."
16477,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,What should we do?
16478,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Asami,Let's go to my factory. Maybe we can get a few of those hummingbird suits up and running.
16479,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Suyin,We're coming with you.
16480,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,I'll head to the front lines and help General Iroh.
16481,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,"Kuvira, this is President Raiko. I order you to stand down. Turn your army around and leave."
16482,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,You're in no position to give orders.
16483,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,"Stand down, or we will attack!"
16484,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,I don't think you understand the power I possess. Let me make it clear.
16485,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Varrick,''This'' is exactly why I didn't wanna build that weapon!
16486,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Iroh,"Mister President, do I have your order to engage?"
16487,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,You have three seconds before I wipe out your army.
16488,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,I have no choice.
16489,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,Time's up!
16490,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,''Stop!'' We surrender. Republic City is yours.
16491,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,"Good. Turn your army and the Avatar over to me, and give Baatar your location. He'll present you with our terms."
16492,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,I'm not surrendering!
16493,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Iroh,Get back to the city before she sees you. And Korra -- --find a way to beat that thing.
16494,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,I will.
16495,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Raiko surrendered. It's down to us now.
16496,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Bolin,"How are we supposed to fight an entire army, a mecha giant, and that crazy weapon?"
16497,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Asami,"We can't fight it, but maybe we can cripple it. Zhu Li, when you were spying on Kuvira, did you learn anything about that metal monster?"
16498,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Zhu Li,I had no idea they were even building it.
16499,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Varrick,Guess Baatar Jr. is a better inventor than I thought. Don't tell him I said that.
16500,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,"That's it! Baatar Jr. built it, he'll know how to take it down! I say we capture him, and get him to talk."
16501,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,Hmm ...
16502,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,"I know it's a long shot, but it's the only chance we have, and if we don't ..."
16503,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Tenzin,"Korra, I'm in."
16504,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,"We'll need a stealth team of airbenders to get in and out of Baatar's airship unnoticed. Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai, let's get moving."
16505,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Meelo,What about me?
16506,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,"Sorry, buddy. This mission counts on everyone being as silent as possible - - and your farts are just too much of a wild card."
16507,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Meelo,"I can be quiet! Okay, point taken."
16508,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Is everyone ready?
16509,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,"That's why, before she finds out, you're going to tell us how to stop that mecha giant, or else."
16510,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Suyin,Let me talk to him.
16511,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,What's going on? Is everything all right?
16512,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Lin,"All right, enough whispering!"
16513,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,I'm ready to discuss the terms of the surrender with Baatar Jr. Where is he?
16514,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Suyin,Baatar --
16515,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Suyin,"Why are you doing this? I know you set out to help better the world, but this is madness!"
16516,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Suyin,But at what cost? How many people have to lose their lives before Kuvira is satisfied?
16517,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Suyin,"I don't know what I did to hurt you, but whatever it was, I'm sorry. When you left Zaofu, it broke my heart -- -- and our family has never been the same since. Please, Baatar -- stop all this and come home. We want you back with us."
16518,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,We've been going about his all wrong. You're right. I'm not gonna physically hurt you if you don't talk. But there is something I could do that will be even more painful. I will take away the one thing you care for the most ... ''Kuvira.''
16519,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,"Kuvira might win. She might chase us out of the city. But you won't be around to enjoy the victory. Because wherever I run, I'll take you. I am going to make it my life's mission to never let you see the one you love again. Is taking the city worth losing Kuvira forever?"
16520,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,''I will'' ... unless you convince Kuvira to back off. You two will still have the Earth Empire. Just leave the United Republic alone.
16521,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,"For goodness' sake, give me that radio! Let me talk to her."
16522,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,"Kuvira, this is Raiko. What kind of game are you playing? You told me you would send Baatar over with your terms, and then he doesn't show."
16523,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,"What do you mean, ""he didn't show""?"
16524,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,"According to your people, he's not on the airship."
16525,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,"If he's not on the airship, then where is he?"
16526,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,Are you injured?
16527,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,Is the Avatar there with you now?
16528,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Kuvira,Find out where that signal's coming from.
16529,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mecha operator,We've identified their position.
16530,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,"As soon as we work out terms with Kuvira, we'll let you out of here."
16531,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Mako,Guys! She must have our location! She's pointing that weapon right at us!
16532,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Korra,Everyone out! Now! ''Now!''
16533,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Raiko,No!
16534,2,Kuvira's Gambit,Balance,4,111,Lin,Keep the president safe! I'm going to check for survivors.
16535,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Shiro Shinobi,"The Earth Empire has invaded the United Republic! After Kuvira demonstrated the power of her spirit energy weapon, President Raiko surrendered the city, but the Avatar refused to give up without a fight. Korra held Baatar Jr. hostage, hoping to force Kuvira to back down, but the plan failed and she fired on Team Avatar's hideout. Can anything or anyone stop Kuvira and her mecha giant?"
16536,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Bolin,"Go ahead, take your time, just bending a giant wall! Man, have we got a lot of people hurt! ''Is that everybody?! Gah!''"
16537,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Tenzin,"Kuvira is heading our way, with a platoon of mecha suits!"
16538,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,What should we do?
16539,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Bolin,"This is my hometown and I hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing! Let her take the city for now! We'll think of some way to come back and beat her!"
16540,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Mako,"What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet? If Kuvira finds out that Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out."
16541,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu. I'm not letting her conquer Republic City. The world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.
16542,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Lin,I agree. We take down that giant ''today''.
16543,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,Lin!
16544,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Lin,Glad to see you all made it out. You had me worried.
16545,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"Well, you benders are going to have to fight her alone. She just blew up our factory with all our hummingbird suits."
16546,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,"Not all of them. There are the prototypes back at my office. If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support."
16547,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,"Su, you take Baatar Jr. and the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office. Get those suits working as soon as you can. The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own."
16548,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Pema,"Everyone, please settle down. The trains should be returning to pick us up soon."
16549,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Evacuee,Tell that mecha jerk to settle down. She's the one blowing up the whole city!
16550,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Train conductor,"I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but I just heard on the radio that Kuvira's army has destroyed the train tracks. We're not getting out of the city by rail."
16551,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Evacuee,Oh great! The giant one wasn't enough?! It's over! We're all gonna get blown to bits!
16552,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,"Listen everyone, I can get us out of here if you just sit tight. Can you step off the bench, please? It's a little crowded up here."
16553,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Train conductor,Sure. I'm only the conductor. No one needs ''me'' on the bench.
16554,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,Just stay calm. I'll be right back. Come on.
16555,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,I'm going to get some help. You think you can handle this unruly mob for a little while?
16556,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Pema,I raised Meelo. I can handle anything.
16557,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Meelo,A paint store? That's it!
16558,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Lin,"What are you doing, Meelo?"
16559,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Meelo,"I just got an idea how to beat the giant. Now, everyone, grab some paint and find me some balloons!"
16560,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Soldier,Airbenders approaching.
16561,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Kuvira,I see them.
16562,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Meelo,Bombs away!
16563,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Kuvira,Clear the glass!
16564,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Tenzin,Now!
16565,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Lin,"The joints are platinum, too! We can't metalbend any of it!"
16566,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Bolin,"You're about to get the world's largest hot foot, metal lady!"
16567,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Bolin,Hit it now!
16568,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Bolin,''Opal!''
16569,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,Everyone retreat! Take the wounded back to Asami's office!
16570,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Lin,I'll meet you there! I'm going to see if I can find any help!
16571,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"All right, let's fire it up again!"
16572,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,I can't stabilize it! I thought you fixed the hydraulics.
16573,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,I did! Twist harder!
16574,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Daw,I hope you have something in here that can take out a platoon of mecha suits. Kuvira's troops are headed this way!
16575,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"I know how to take down some mecha suits and it just might take down that giant, too. Asami, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back. Zhu Li, let's go."
16576,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Suyin,"Just rest, son. I'm here."
16577,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Suyin,"I don't know, sweetie. She's a complicated person."
16578,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Suyin,"Yeah, they might take some time to come around. But we'll work through it as a family."
16579,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,"Do you think this plan will actually work, sir?"
16580,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"I know I can stop the mecha suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a ''giant'' mecha suit with a ''giant'' electromagnetic pulse. Zhu Li, I've been thinking."
16581,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,"You're always thinking, sir."
16582,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"Yes. But lately, I've been thinking about you. I know we might not make it out of this mess and I feel like there are some things I should tell you."
16583,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,There are?
16584,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich horse. Named her Mrs. Beaks. I grew up on a farm. Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li? This was before the circus people took me away. Anyway, I loved old Mrs. Beaks, but I took her for granted."
16585,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,"You'll have to finish your story later. Kuvira's troops are in range. Okay, I hope this works."
16586,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"Yes! Dead in their tracks. Oh, rats. She's still coming. Zhu Li, do the thing!"
16587,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,I'm afraid there are no more things to do.
16588,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Kuvira,What was that?
16589,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Soldier,"An electromagnetic pulse. It shut down the mecha suits, but our power source is fine."
16590,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Kuvira,"Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where Varrick is. Third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in the city."
16591,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Bolin,"Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha suits but not the big one?"
16592,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,It's not.
16593,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,Dad?
16594,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Lin,"I got him out of jail to help. I figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now. If the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in."
16595,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,"I know what you all must think of me, but I love Republic City and I would do anything to save her."
16596,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,You think you know how to defeat this thing?
16597,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,"You must act like an infection: break the skin and attack its vital organs, disconnect the heart and the brain and this beast cannot live."
16598,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,But how are we supposed to get inside?
16599,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,Future Industries has plasma saws for cutting platinum. If we had one on the mecha suit ...
16600,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,But the saws are way too big. We'd never get the suits off the ground.
16601,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw. Then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in.
16602,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,Like a metal mosquito.
16603,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me? I squash 'em!
16604,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits. It looks like they're our only hope.
16605,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Pema,"Oh, first he ate the fruit, then he ate the leaves. Hungry little lemur, ate up all my trees. Okay, great job everybody. Who's got another song for us?"
16606,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Evacuee,"We can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured, or ''worse''."
16607,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Pema,Should we play the button game? Who has a button?
16608,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Pema,Where do these badgermoles come from?
16609,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,"The zoo! Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!"
16610,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Evacuee,"Well, what are we supposed to do with badgermoles?"
16611,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,They're the best earthbenders around! We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us.
16612,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Evacuee,Are you sure this is the best plan? Let's follow the moles!
16613,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,"Badgermoles, digging holes, under Republic City. Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty."
16614,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Kuvira,"Mech platoons, report."
16615,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Third platoon,"Third platoon, no sign of anyone so far."
16616,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Fourth platoon,"Fourth platoon, en route to train station."
16617,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Soldier,I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse: Future Industries Tower.
16618,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Kuvira,That's the place.
16619,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Daw,Kuvira is headed our way!
16620,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?
16621,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,Just a few more minutes.
16622,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,Get out there as soon as you can.
16623,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,"Thanks. We may not be able to beat that thing, but we ''can'' slow it down. Let's go!"
16624,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Tenzin,Jinora!
16625,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,"Oh, Yin, you're the sweetest evacuee I've ever known. And I just want to thank you for being so kind, when I was living in your home."
16626,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Earth Empire sergeant,"Halt! Turn around slowly and please, stop that singing. You're all Earth Empire prisoners. Come with us and no one will get hurt."
16627,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,"You don't need these people. They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm Prince Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom. Take me to Kuvira. I've got business with her."
16628,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Tu,"No! Don't do it, Wu."
16629,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,"I have to. But before I go, I'd like to sing you a song. If you don't respect the broach, you don't respect me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're no better than a roach, but I'm royalty. I got my badgermoles with me."
16630,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Earth Empire sergeant,"Actually, your song is so bad, your badgermoles deserted you."
16631,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Wu,"You don't know what you're talking about. Oh, badgermoles I love you, I love you. I want to, I want to pet your snouts."
16632,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,"If we stop that mecha giant, it will all be because of you."
16633,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,You're the one who designed these incredible suits. It's great to be working together again.
16634,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,"I love you, Dad."
16635,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,"I love you, too."
16636,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,Zhu Li?
16637,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,Yes?
16638,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,I have something I need to attach before we take off.
16639,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,Attached to what?
16640,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"I need to attach this ring to your finger. Zhu Li Moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives?"
16641,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,Yes.
16642,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,Yes! Now let's go attach these barely functional rust buckets to a giant killer smashing machine!
16643,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,It's exactly how I always pictured our engagement.
16644,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,Aim for that spot in the middle of the back - the one I can never reach.
16645,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,Got it.
16646,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Varrick,"Wah, let's get out of here! Wow! I wish I had that kind of flexibility."
16647,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Zhu Li,Hang on!
16648,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Kuvira,I need more power! They're cutting in! More power!
16649,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,We need to get out of here.
16650,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,Almost there.
16651,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,We have to go now!
16652,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,Almost there. Almost there!
16653,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,Dad! Now!
16654,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Hiroshi,"Goodbye, Asami. I love you."
16655,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Asami,Dad!
16656,2,Day of the Colossus,Balance,4,112,Korra,Hiroshi's plan worked. There's our opening.
16657,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Shiro Shinobi,"Republic City is a war zone! While Prince Wu led the remaining citizens to safety, Team Avatar battled Kuvira's giant mech, but no amount of bending could bring it down! In a last-ditch effort, Asami and her father outfitted the hummingbird suits with platinum cutters. Hiroshi helped Team Avatar infiltrate the mecha giant, but he paid the ultimate price! Is victory within reach for our heroes?"
16658,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,Initiate lockdown! Find the Avatar and whoever else is with her.
16659,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"We need to move fast. Su, Lin, climb up to the arm and try to disable that weapon. Mako, Bolin, get to the engine and see if you can power this thing down. I'm going after Kuvira."
16660,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Suyin,Are you sure? When you fought Kuvira before ...
16661,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,I know. She almost destroyed me. Not this time.
16662,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,I'm going for that lever. You get the other one.
16663,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Guard,Hey!
16664,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Lin,Nice work.
16665,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Suyin,"The outside may be platinum, but we can do a lot of damage in here."
16666,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Helmsman,The weapon's loading mechanism has malfunctioned. We're unable to fire.
16667,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,I'm ready!
16668,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,"Be with you in one second! Kind of busy! Okay, ready now!"
16669,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,One ... two ... three! Nothing's happening!
16670,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,Kuvira must've done some override thing and taken control!
16671,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here.
16672,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,Ummm ...
16673,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,Come on. You spent all that time working with Varrick and Baatar Jr. Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?
16674,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,Want to fill me in?
16675,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,I'm gonna zap these vines with some electricity.
16676,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,"Let's back it up, okay? I said ''that'' will make the vines ''explode''."
16677,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,Exactly. This is our only way of shutting this thing down. I can handle it.
16678,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,"I don't have time to argue! I'm doing this, so get out of here!"
16679,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,"Okay, but for the record, I do not approve. Just, get out as soon as you can. Promise?"
16680,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,Promise.
16681,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,I love you.
16682,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,"I love you, too. Now go!"
16683,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,Stop!
16684,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,Kuvira! Give up!
16685,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,Never.
16686,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"Please, stop this madness! It has to end now!"
16687,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,"If you really want to end it, then come and get me!"
16688,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,''Now'' it's over.
16689,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,''Don't!''
16690,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,Shut it down!
16691,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,I can't!
16692,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,Look!
16693,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Tenzin,A new spirit portal.
16694,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mecha suit captain,Spread out and find Kuvira!
16695,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,Korra!
16696,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,"Tenzin, there's no sign of her."
16697,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Tenzin,Keep looking! Korra! ''Korra!''
16698,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,What happened? Are we ... dead?
16699,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"No, we're okay, but we're in the Spirit World. All the energy from your weapon tore open a new portal and blasted us in here."
16700,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,"Why would you save my life, after everything I did to you?"
16701,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,I guess ... I see a lot of myself in you.
16702,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,We are nothing alike!
16703,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,"This wasn't how I wanted things to end. If you would have all just surrendered, none of this would have happened."
16704,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"You brought this on yourself. Messing with the spirit vines, acting like a dictator over your people ... you ''had'' to know what you were doing wasn't right."
16705,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,"I was trying to ''help'' my people. Su turned her back on the Earth Kingdom, you were ''gone''! I had to do something."
16706,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,I think I get it now.
16707,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,You don't understand anything about me.
16708,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,I do. Su told me how she took you in when you were younger. It must have been ''so'' hard being an orphan.
16709,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,"''Don't pretend you know what it felt like! The Avatar is adored by millions! I was cast aside by ''my own parents'' like I meant nothing to them. How could I just stand by and watch the same thing happen to my nation, when it needed someone to guide it?"
16710,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"You wanted to create a place where you and your people would never be vulnerable again. I may not have been an orphan, but believe me, I understand what it feels like to be afraid. After I was poisoned, I would have done anything to feel in control."
16711,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Tenzin,The spirits have returned.
16712,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Asami,And so has Korra!
16713,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,You're okay!
16714,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mecha suit captain,"Release Kuvira, or we will attack!"
16715,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,Stand down. This battle is over. I owe the Avatar my life. Her power is beyond anything I could ever hope to achieve. I'll accept whatever punishment the world sees fit.
16716,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Kuvira,"And Su, I'm sorry for all the anguish I've caused you and your family."
16717,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Suyin,You're going to answer for ''everything'' you've done.
16718,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,"And though the battle took a severe toll on our beloved city, out of the destruction, love did bloom! So that is why, dearest friends and family, we gather today to celebrate the wondrous, and at time inexplicable bond between Sir Varrick and the Lady Zhu Li!"
16719,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,"True love is a fickle creature. Difficult to find, nearly impossible to tame. But Varrick and Zhu Li have proven that even the longest of long shots can have a chance at happiness together. Now, for the vows! Thank you, Master Pabu. Do you, Sir Iknik Blackstone Varrick of the Southern Water Tribe, Master of the High Seas, take the Lady Zhu Li Moon to be your lawfully wedded wife? Will you promise to treat her not as your assistant, but as your honored and cherished partner?"
16720,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Varrick,You're darn tootin' I do!
16721,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Zhu Li,I do take Varrick. Callouses and all.
16722,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Bolin,You may now do the thing.
16723,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Zhu Li,Are you all right?
16724,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Varrick,You just make me so dang happy!
16725,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,"My cousin told me how level-headed you were during the whole evacuation. I got to admit, I'm impressed. I think you're going to make a great leader. But that doesn't mean I'm gonna set you up with Korra, so don't ask."
16726,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Wu,"That's okay, Mako. Sometimes, a good evacuation is its own reward."
16727,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"Good to see you, Prince Wu. Or should I say, King Wu? You ready to get back to Ba Sing Se and finally take the throne?"
16728,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Wu,Yeah ... about that ... I was actually thinking of stepping down as king and getting rid of the monarchy all together.
16729,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,Are ... you joking?
16730,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Wu,"For once, I'm not. Now I know what you're gonna say, I'm being lazy, I'm afraid of responsibility, I'm putting my singing career before my people, but it's none of those things. I really think the Earth Kingdom would be better off if the states were independent and had elected leaders, like the United Republic."
16731,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,That's ... actually pretty wise and mature of you.
16732,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"I think it's a great idea. The Earth Kingdom ''should'' evolve, and I'll do everything in my power to help you make that happen."
16733,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Wu,"Looking forward to working with you. But for now, the dance floor calls."
16734,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,How's the arm?
16735,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,Much better.
16736,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"The words ""thank you"" don't feel big enough for what you did. But I honestly don't know what else to say."
16737,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Mako,"You don't need to say anything. I want you to know, I'll follow you into battle, no matter how crazy things get. I've got your back ... and I always will ."
16738,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Tenzin,"I spoke to President Raiko. Tomorrow, he's announcing a plan to expand the city, rather than rebuild downtown."
16739,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,I bet Aang never could have imagined there'd be a spirit portal right in the heart of Republic City.
16740,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Tenzin,"Korra, you've transformed the world more in a few years than most Avatars did during their lifetimes."
16741,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,But I feel like I've only just begun. There's so much more I want to learn and do.
16742,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Tenzin,You don't know how happy I am to hear you so full of hope again.
16743,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"It's been a bit of a bumpy ride, huh?"
16744,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Tenzin,"I've come to realize life is one, big, bumpy ride."
16745,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"I know I was in a pretty dark place after I was poisoned. But I finally understand why I had to go through all that. I needed to understand what true suffering was so I could be more compassionate to others, even to people like Kuvira."
16746,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Asami,"Excuse me Tenzin, Varrick is looking for you. Something about wanting to borrow a glidersuit to fly off the tower?"
16747,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Tenzin,That doesn't seem like a good idea!
16748,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,Wanna sit with me for a minute? I'm not ready to get back to the party just yet. I don't think I ever really apologized.
16749,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Asami,For what?
16750,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,For being gone all that time. For not coming back sooner.
16751,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,I am ''so'' sorry for what happened.
16752,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Asami,Thank you. I'm just glad I was able to forgive him.
16753,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"So, what now? Back to the dance floor?"
16754,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Asami,"I'm kind of all danced out. Honestly, after everything that's happened the past few months, I could use a vacation."
16755,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,"Let's do it! Let's go on a vacation, just the two of us. Anywhere you want."
16756,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Asami,Really? Okay ... I've always wanted to see what the Spirit World's like.
16757,2,The Last Stand,Balance,4,113,Korra,Sounds perfect.
